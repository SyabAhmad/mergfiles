## Merge CSV Files into One Single File
        - Provide CSV files only.
        - First, give it a list of CSV files, and then it will automatically merge each file into one file.
        - After merging, you can choose to download the merged file as a CSV or TXT file.
        - Support of more  extensions will be added soon.
