Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in this region have resulted in catastrophic damages and fatalities in the past decades. The recent warming has caused dramatic glacial lake changes and increased potential GLOF risk in the Himalaya. However, our knowledge on the current state and change of glacial lakes in the entire Himalaya is limited. This study maps the current (2015) distribution of glacial lakes across the entire Himalaya and monitors the spatially-explicit evolution of glacial lakes over five time periods from 1990 to 2015 using a total of 348 Landsat images at 30 m resolution. The results show that 4950 glacial lakes in 2015 cover a total area of 455.3 +/- 72.7 km(2), mainly located between 4000 m and 5700 m above sea level. Himalayan glacial lakes expanded by approximately 14.1% from 1990 to 2015. The changing patterns of supraglacial lakes and proglacial lakes are rather complex, involving both lake disappearance and emergence. Many emergent glacial lakes are found at higher elevations, especially the new proglacial lakes, which have formed as a result of glacier retreat. Spatially heterogeneous changes of Himalayan glacial lakes are observed, with the most significant expansion occurring in the southern slopes of the central Himalaya. Increasing glacier meltwater induced by the Himalayan atmospheric warming is a primary cause for the observed lake expansion. This study provides primary data for future GLOF risk assessments. A total of 118 rapidly expanded glacial lakes are identified as potential vulnerable lakes for the priority of risk assessment.

Millions of people reside in critical zones potentially exposed to such catastrophes. Despite this, a comprehensive assessment of mass movement exposure is lacking at a regional scale. Here, we developed a novel method of determining mass movement trajectories and applied it to the Himalayan Mountain ranges for the first time to quantify the exposure of infrastructure, waterways, roadways, and population in six mountain ranges, including Hindu Kush, Karakoram, western Himalaya, eastern Himalaya, central Himalaya, and Hengduan Shan. Our results reveal that the exposure of buildings and roadways to mass movements is highest in Karakoram, whereas central Himalaya has the highest exposed waterways. The hotspots of exposed roadways are concentrated in Nepal, the North Indian states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, the Union Territory of Ladakh, and China's Sichuan Province. Our analysis shows that the population in the central Himalaya is currently at the highest exposure to mass movement impacts. Projected future populations based on Shared Socio-economic and Representative Concentration Pathways suggest that changing settlement patterns and emission scenarios will significantly influence the potential impact of these events on the human population. Assessment of anticipated secondary hazards (glacial lake outburst floods) shows an increase in probable headward impacts of mass movements on glacial lakes in the future.

This study presents the latest remote sensing-based inventory (2017) of glacial lakes (size >= 0.0036 km(2)) across the Nepal Himalaya using optical satellite data. Furthermore, this study traces the decadal glacial lake dynamics from 1977 to 2017 in the Nepal Himalaya. The decadal mapping of glacial lakes (both glacial-fed and nonglacial-fed) across the Nepal Himalaya reveals an increase in the number and area of lakes from 1977 to 2017, with 606 (55.53 +/- 16.52 km(2)), 1137 (64.56 +/- 11.64 km(2)), 1228 (68.87 +/- 12.18 km(2)), 1489 (74.2 +/- 14.22 km(2)), and 1541 (80.95 +/- 15.25 km(2)) glacial lakes being mapped in 1977, 1987, 1997, 2007, and 2017, respectively. Glacial lakes show heterogeneous rates of expansion in different river basins and elevation zones of Nepal, with apparent decadal emergences and disappearances. Overall, the glacial lakes exhibited similar to 25% expansion of surface areas from 1987 to 2017. For the period from 1987 to 2017, proglacial lakes with ice contact, among others, exhibited the highest incremental changes in terms of number (181%) and surface area (82%). The continuous amplified mass loss of glaciers, as reported in Central Himalaya, is expected to accompany glacial lake expansion in the future, increasing the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). We emphasize that the rapidly increasing glacial lakes in the Nepal Himalaya can pose potential GLOF threats to downstream population and infrastructure.","[Khadka, Nitesh; Zhang, Guoqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Khadka, Nitesh] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqing] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Thakuri, Sudeep] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Environm Sci, Kirtipur 44618, Nepal",,"Zhang, GQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Zhang, GQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",niteshkhadka48@gmail.commailto; guoqing.zhang@itpcas.ac.cn; sthakuri@cdes.edu.np,,,,,,,,57.0,58.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2018,10.0,12,,,,,,,1913,10.3390/rs10121913,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10121913,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000455637600055,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we used high resolution satellite data such as Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) LISS-IV (5.8 m) and Google earth images supplemented with field survey to generate an updated glacial lake inventory of Upper Jhelum Basin (UJB) of Kashmir Himalaya. The Sentinel-2A (10 m), Landsat-OLI (30 m) and MSS (60 m), and Cartosat-DEM (30 m) were additional data sources used for glacial lake mapping and change detection analysis. A total of 393 glacial lakes covering an area of 21.55 +/- 3.8 km(2) were identified, mapped and inventoried. The lake inventory includes 102 proglacial lakes, 13 supraglacial lakes and 278 unconnected glacial lakes. Using the weighted index-based method, 21 glacial lakes were found as Potentially Dangerous Glacial Lakes (PDGLs). Out of these, 7 lakes were classified as High, 9 as Medium and 5 as Low hazard glacial lakes as per the hazard assessment. Change detection analysis of PDGLs from 1980 to 2020 revealed an increase in area from 5.92 km(2) to 8.46 km(2) thereby, indicating a growth of 2.51 +/- 0.9 km(2)(30%) at a rate of 0.063 km(2)/year. The formation and growth of glacial lakes in this area is attributed to continuous glacier recession under the warming trend of temperature and declining nature of precipitation. In this study, the findings showed that T-avg and T-min are rising significantly at a rate of 0.004oC/year and 0.013oC/year respectively.

P.",,,Sectorwise Assessment of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Danger in the Indian Himalayan Region,MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Climate change and associated glacier recession have led to the formation of new glacial lakes and the expansion of existing ones across the Himalayas. Many pose a potential glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) threat to downstream communities and infrastructure. In this paper, 4418 glacial lakes in the Indian Himalayan Region and 636 transboundary lakes are analyzed. We consider hazard, exposure, and integrated danger levels using robust geographic information system-based automated approaches. The hazard level of takes was estimated based on the potential for avalanches to strike the lake, size of the lake and its upstream watershed, and distal slope of its dam. Exposure levels were calculated by intersecting cropland, roads, hydropower projects, and the human population with potential GLOF trajectories. Then, GLOF danger was determined as a function of hazard and exposure. The study demonstrates that Jammu and Kashmir (JK) is potentially the most threatened region in terms of total number of very high and high danger lakes (n = 556), followed by Arunachal Pradesh (AP) (n = 388) and Sikkim (SK) (n = 219). Sectorwise, JK faces the greatest GLOF threat to roads and population, whereas the threat to cropland and hydropower is greatest in AP and SK, respectively. Transboundary lakes primarily threaten AP and, to a lesser extent, Himachal Pradesh (HP). For Uttarakhand (UK), the impacts of potential future glacial lakes, expected to form during rapid ongoing glacier recession because of climate change, are explored. Finally, a comparison of current results with previous studies suggests that 13 lakes in SK, 5 in HR 4 in JK, 2 in UK, and 1 in AP are of highest priority for local investigation and potential risk reduction measures. Current results are of vital importance to policymakers, disaster management authorities, and the scientific community.","[Mal, Suraj] Univ Delhi, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Coll, Dept Geog, New Delhi 110017, India; [Allen, Simon K.; Frey, Holger; Huggel, Christian] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland; [Allen, Simon K.] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Dimri, A.

The Xixabangma massif is one of the most populated areas in the Himalayas and has suffered from multiple GLOFs. To estimate the glacier melting rate in the past four decades and analyze the outburst risk of glacial lakes in the Xixabangma massif, we determined changes in glacier mass balance, glacier area and glacial lake area based on KH-9 images, TanDEM-X images, Landsat images, SRTM DEM and ICESat-2 elevations. Our results show that, from 1974 to 2018, the total glacier area shrank from 954.01 km(2) to 752.46 km(2), whereas the total glacial lake area grew from 20.90 km(2) to 38.71 km(2). From 1974 to 2000, 2000 to 2013 and 2013 to 2018, the region-wide glacier mass balance values were -0.16 m w.e./a, -0.31 m w.e./a and -0.29 m w.e./a, respectively. Three glacial lakes, named Gangxico, Galongco and Jialongco, respectively, expanded by 127.14%, 373.45% and 436.36% from 1974 to 2018, and the mass loss rates of their parent glaciers from 2000 to 2013 increased by 81.72%, 122.22% and 160.00% relative to those during 1974 to 2000. The dams of these three lakes are unstable, and their drainage valleys directly connect to a major town and its infrastructure. Due to current high-water levels, possible external events such as ice collapse, landslide, heavy rainfall and earthquakes can easily trigger GLOFs.

As a result of this climate variability in the Sikkim Himalaya, a detailed study of the Gurudongmar lake complex (GLC) evolution and outburst susceptibility assessment is required. Glacial lake volume estimation and lake outburst susceptibility assessment were carried out to reveal different characteristics for all four lakes (GL-1, GL-2, GL-3, and GL-4) from the lake complex. Each of these lakes has a moderate to very high potential to outburst. As the dam of GL-1 provides no retention capacity, there is a very high potential of a combined effect with the sudden failure of the moraine-dams of GL-2 or GL-3 located upstream. Temporal analysis of GLC using optical remote sensing data and in-field investigations revealed a rapidly increasing total lake area by ~74 +/- 3%, with an expansion rate of +0.03 +/- 0.002 km(2) a(-1) between 1962 and 2018 due to climate change and ongoing glacier retreat. The overall lake area expansion rates are dependent on climate-driven factors, and constantly increasing average air temperature is responsible for the enlargement of the lake areas. Simultaneously, changes in GLC expansion velocity are driven by changes in the total amount of precipitation. The deficit in precipitation probably triggered the initial higher rate from 1962 to 1988 during the winter and spring seasons. The post-1990s positive anomaly in precipitation might have reduced the rate of the glacial lake area expansion considerably.","[Chowdhury, Arindam; De, Sunil Kumar] North Eastern Hill Univ, Sch Human & Environm Sci, Dept Geog, Shillong 793022, Meghalaya, India; [Kroczek, Tomas; Vilimek, Vit] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Phys Geog & Geoecol, Fac Sci, Albertov 6, Prague 12800, Czech Republic; [Sharma, Milap Chand] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Study Reg Dev, New Delhi 110067, India; [Debnath, Manasi] Adamas Univ, Sch Basic & Appl Sci, Dept Geog, Kolkata 700126, India",,"De, SK (corresponding author), North Eastern Hill Univ, Sch Human & Environm Sci, Dept Geog, Shillong 793022, Meghalaya, India.",arindam.nehu30@gmail.com; tomas.kroczek@natur.cuni.cz; desunil@yahoo.com; vit.vilimek@natur.cuni.cz; milap@jnu.ac.in; manasi.jnu2012@gmail.com,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2021,13.0,24,,,,,,,3565,10.3390/w13243565,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13243565,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000742868000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is estimated for lake development under present-day and future warming scenarios, highlighting emerging hotspots and transboundary impacts. Warming on Earth's Third Pole is leading to rapid loss of ice and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes, posing a severe threat to downstream communities. Here we provide a holistic assessment of past evolution, present state and modelled future change of glacial lakes and related glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) risk across the Third Pole. We show that the highest GLOF risk is at present centred in the eastern Himalaya, where the current risk level is at least twice that in adjacent regions. In the future, GLOF risk will potentially almost triple as a consequence of further lake development, and additional hotspots will emerge to the west, including within transboundary regions. With apparent increases in GLOF risk already anticipated by the mid-twenty-first century in some regions, the results highlight the urgent need for forward-looking, collaborative, long-term approaches to mitigate future impacts and enhance sustainable development across the Third Pole.","[Zheng, Guoxiong; Bao, Anming; Li, Junli; Yuan, Ye; Jiang, Liangliang; Yu, Tao] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Guoxiong; Allen, Simon Keith; Ballesteros-Canovas, Juan Antonio; Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Climat Change Impacts & Risks Anthropocene C CIA, Geneva, Switzerland; [Zheng, Guoxiong; Yuan, Ye; Jiang, Liangliang; Yu, Tao; Chen, Wenfeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Allen, Simon Keith] Univ Zurich, Dept Geog, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bao, Anming] CAS HEC, China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ballesteros-Canovas, Juan Antonio; Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, Dendrolab Ch, Geneva, Switzerland; [Huss, Matthias] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Lab Hydraul Hydrol & Glaciol VAW, Zurich, Switzerland; [Huss, Matthias] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Huss, Matthias] Univ Fribourg, Dept Geosci, Fribourg, Switzerland; [Zhang, Guoqing; Chen, Wenfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoqing] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Bao, A (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi, Peoples R China.;Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Climat Change Impacts & Risks Anthropocene C CIA, Geneva, Switzerland.;Bao, A (corresponding author), CAS HEC, China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan.;Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, Dendrolab Ch, Geneva, Switzerland.;Stoffel, M (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.",baoam@ms.xjb.ac.cn; markus.stoffel@unige.ch,,,,,,,,139.0,150.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021,11.0,5,,,,,411,+,,10.1038/s41558-021-01028-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-021-01028-3,,MAY 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000647948000014,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study reports variation of the end-moraine dammed lakes in the high altitude Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalaya (HKH) region of Pakistan to evaluate future floods hazard under changing climate in this region. An integrated temporal remote sensing and Geographic information system (GIS) based approach using satellite images of Landsat-7 and 8 was adopted to detect 482 endmoraine dammed lakes out of which 339 lakes (> 0.02 km(2)) were selected for temporal change analysis during the 2001-2013 period. The findings of the study revealed a net expansion in the end-moraine dammed lakes area in the Karakoram (about 7.7%) and in the Himalayas (4.6%), while there was a net shrinkage of about 1.5% in the lakes area in the Hindukush range during this period. The percentage increase in the lakes' area was highest above 4500 m asl in the Hindukush, within 3500-4000 m asl in the Himalayas and below 3500 m asl in the Karakoram range. The overall positive change in the lakes' area appears to prevail in various altitudinal ranges of the region. The heterogeneous areal changes in the endmoraine dammed lakes might be attributed to different climate regimes and glacial hydrodynamics in the three HKH ranges. A periodic monitoring of the glacial lakes and their associated glaciers is essential for developing effective hazard assessment and risk reduction strategies for this high altitude Himalayan region.","[Ashraf, Arshad; Naz, Rozina; Iqbal, Muhammad Bilal] Natl Agr Res Ctr, Climate Change Alternate Energy & Water Resources, Islamabad, Pakistan",,"Ashraf, A (corresponding author), Natl Agr Res Ctr, Climate Change Alternate Energy & Water Resources, Pk Rd, Islamabad, Pakistan.",mashr22@yahoo.com; rozinanaz_2013@yahoo.com; bilaliqbal9@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2015,12.0,5,,,,,1113,1124,,10.1007/s11629-014-3245-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-014-3245-4,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000362582200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is of great significance to understand the spatial distribution and change characteristics of glacial lakes for exploring their response patterns to climate change and assessing the glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) susceptibility. Based on Gaofen-1/6 PMS, Sentinel-2A/2B MSI and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images from 2000 to 2020, we integrated geographic information technology and mathematical and statistical methods to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of glacial lakes in Nepal and their dynamic changes, and further discriminated and evaluated the GLOF susceptibility of glacial lakes. The results show that there were 2420 glacial lakes in Nepal in 2020, mainly distributed within the 4500 similar to 5500 m, with an area of 87.21 km(2) and a water storage of 1921.72 x 10(6) m(3). The number and area of glacial lakes with each area above 0.01 km(2) in Nepal showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2020, while 499 new glacial lakes were born, 139 lakes disappeared, the area and water storage increased by 19.46 km(2), 403.07 x 10(6) m(3), respectively. Glacial lakes at altitudes <3000 m were relatively stable, while the number and area of glacial lakes at altitudes within 4500-5500 m increased rapidly.

However, glacial lake outburst floods have significantly jeopardized the safety of local residents. To better understand the changes in glacial lakes in response to climate change, it is necessary to conduct a long-term evaluation on the areal dynamics of glacial lakes, assisted with local observations. Here, we propose an innovative method of classification and stacking extraction to accurately delineate glacial lakes in southwestern Tibet from 1990 to 2020. Based on Landsat images and meteorological data, we used geographic detectors to detect correlation factors. Multiple regression models were used to analyze the driving factors of the changes in glacier lake area. We combined bathymetric data of the glacial lakes with the changes in climatic variables and utilized HEC-RAS to determine critical circumstances for glacial lake outbursts. The results show that the area of glacial lakes in Nyalam County increased from 27.95 km(2) in 1990 to 52.85 km(2) in 2020, and eight more glacial lakes were observed in the study area. The glacial lake area expanded by 89.09%, where we found significant growth from 2015 to 2020. The correlation analysis between the glacial lake area and climate change throughout the period shows that temperature and precipitation dominate the expansion of these lakes from 1990 to 2020. We also discover that the progressive increase in water volume of glacial lakes can be attributed to the constant rise in temperature and freeze-thaw of surrounding glaciers. Finally, the critical conditions for the glacial lake's outburst were predicted by using HEC-RAS combined with the changes in the water volume and climatic factors. It is concluded that GangxiCo endures a maximum water flow of 4.3 x 10(8) m(3), and the glacial lake is in a stable changing stage. This conclusion is consistent with the field investigation and can inform the prediction of glacial lake outbursts in southwestern Tibet in the future.","[Qu, Ge; Dai, Xiaoai; Cheng, Junying; Liu, Wenxin; Yang, Zhichong; Shan, Yunfeng; Ren, Jiashun] Chengdu Univ Technol, Sch Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Li, Weile] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Wang, Meilian] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Lu, Heng] Sichuan Univ, State Key Lab Hydraul & Mt River Engn, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Lu, Heng] Sichuan Univ, Coll Hydraul & Hydroelect Engn, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Wang, Youlin] Northwest Engn Corp Ltd, Xian 710065, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Binyang] China Petr Engn Construct Co Ltd, Southwest Branch, Chengdu 610095, Peoples R China; [Atasoy, Murat] Auburn Univ, Coll Sci & Math, Dept Geosci, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",,"Dai, XA (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Sch Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",daixiaoa@mail.cdut.edu.cn,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,14.0,19,,,,,,,4688,10.3390/rs14194688,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14194688,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000867029100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the terrain is inherently fragile with varied geological, geomorphological, ecological, and climate regimes, that result in frequent slope failure and disruption in connectivity. The risk is further to be increased by extreme events-generated hazards, which are expected to rise in frequency and magnitude with ongoing climate change. Critical scientific intervention, however, can improve the sustainability of road networks. The present study attempts to analyse and quantify the impacts of a major road widening project initiated in 2018 in the upper Ganga catchment, Uttarakhand Himalaya which has destabilised valley slopes along the widened segments. Also, a large quantity of excavated sediments is dumped down slopes, which is posing a threat to aquatic biodiversity. The estimates are based on Google Earth imagery of a few representative road segments recently widened in the upper Ganga catchment, which indicate a substantial increase in the landslide and unstable slope area following the road widening. The increase in unstable slope area is attributed to improper road widening approaches and poor slope management in seismically active Himalayan terrain. Further, the mean velocity plots of Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) indicate that the segments undergoing road widening are coherent with areas of significant earth surface change. A broad correlation between the road width and sediment yield indicates that even a slight increase in road width can result in a large-scale mass removal from the toe of the hillslope, inflicting cascading impact on hillslopes. The study recommends a more flexible road construction approach based on the environmental and geological aspects of the terrain for sustainable road networks. Further, the impact of climate change is looming over the Himalayas, and the relation between climate change and its potential effects on the stability of slopes remains an open issue.","[Sati, S.

The mounting evidences from the high-mountain areas via accelerated glacier melting, permafrost thaw and expansion of glacier lakes are becoming a major concern for high-mountain communities, environmentalists and policy makers. The accelerated expansion of glacial lakes in the higher Himalaya is not just the expression of glacial melting to climate warming, but poses a serious threat in terms of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). The present investigation focuses on a moraine-dammed pro-glacial lake (MDPGL) in the Kadu Nala valley (Lahaul, western Himalaya, India) that has evolved in less than a decade and has been expanding at an alarming rate since 2014. The data show that the actual development of the lake started in 2010 and has expanded to similar to 0.18 km(2) in 2021. The limitation in direct correlations of warming impacting the cryosphere in the higher Himalayan region and hence in the present study is the scarcity of metrological data (especially temperature and precipitation). Therefore, the climate research data (CRU), along with the inferences from tree ring width data, have been used to understand the climatic impacts in this area. Considering that forecasting is a very important aspect of environmental studies, we have used four different forecasting methods to estimate the glacier and glacial lake change scenarios in the present study. The ongoing trends and the model projections of future show accelerated glacier loss and associated glacial lake expansion in Kadu Nala valley and highlight the need for a close monitoring of such lakes, because it has been demonstrated that even the GLOFs from small pro-glacial lakes have the ability to transform into a giant trans-border flood and debris flow. An analogous trend, magnitude and accelerated glacier melting and expansion of glacial lakes in the Himalaya may be attributed to a regionally coherent climate forcing, consistent with atmospheric as well as elevation-dependent warming.","[Ali, Sheikh Nawaz; Singh, Priyanka; Shekhar, Mayank; Misra, Krishna G.

Glacial lake expansion was a dominant contributor to the increase in glacial lake area, accounting for about 67% of the net changes in lake area, whereas newly formed lakes accounted for the remaining 33%.","[Wang Xin; Jiang Zongli; Han Yongshun] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China; [Wang Xin; Liu Shiyin; Guo Wanqin] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yao Xiaojun] NW Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 73000, Peoples R China",,"Wang, X (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Geog, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China.",xinwang_hn@163.com,,,,,,,,46.0,56.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2012,32.0,2,,,,,203,212,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00044.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00044.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000305478400012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The changes in temperature, precipitation, glaciers, and glacial lakes over Nepal are comprehensively reviewed based on published literature and compared with regional studies. Furthermore, the published glacier datasets were used to calculate and analyze the changes in area, equilibrium line of altitude (ELA) and ice reserves to show the response of glaciers to climate change. We find that the warming trend (0.02 to 0.16 degrees C yr-1) is being more pronounced over Nepal, and heterogeneous changes in precipitation amount, pattern, and frequency are observed with no significant trend. Concurrently, the glaciers are found to be responding with heterogeneous shrinkage in area (- 1 to - 5 km(2) yr(-1)), possessing negative mass balance (- 0.3 to - 0.8 m w.e. yr(-1)), decrease in ice volume (- 4.29 km(3) yr(-1)) and upward shift of the ELA (similar to 20.66 m decade(-1)). The total decrease in ice reserve (- 128.84 km(3)) of Nepal has resulted in similar to 0.32 mm of sea level rise in past 30 years. Moreover, the formation and surface area expansion (0.83 % yr(-1)) of glacial lakes over Nepal have been accelerated. Additionally, we note that Nepal is highly susceptible to glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) events and document a total of 45 reliable reported and unreported historical GLOF events from 39 glacial lakes across Nepal. This review will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the current state of climate change and the identification of existing knowledge gaps in Nepal.","[Khadka, Nitesh; Chen, Xiaoqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Earth Surface Proc, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Khadka, Nitesh; Shrestha, Bhaskar] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Sharma, Shankar] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Hydrol & Meteorol, Kirtipur, Nepal; [Sharma, Shankar] Univ New South Wales, Climate Change Res Ctr, Sydney, Australia; [Shrestha, Bhaskar] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Khadka, N; Chen, XQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Earth Surface Proc, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.;Khadka, N (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",niteshkhadka48@gmail.com; xqchen@imde.ac.cn,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2023,23.0,4,,,,,,,143,10.1007/s10113-023-02142-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-023-02142-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001092168300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A multi-hazard map furnishes composite illustration of the natural hazards of varying magnitude, frequency, and spatial distribution. Thus, multi-hazard risk assessment is performed to depict the holistic natural hazards scenario of any particular region. To the best of the authors' knowledge, multi-hazard risk assessments are rarely conducted in Nepal although multiple natural hazards strike the country almost every year. In this study, floods, landslides, earthquakes, and urban fire hazards are used to assess multi-hazard risk in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is then integrated with the Geographical Information System (GIS). First, flood, landslide, earthquake, and urban fire hazard assessments are performed individually and then superimposed to obtain multi-hazard risk. Multi-hazard risk assessment of Kathmandu Valley is performed by pair-wise comparison of the four natural hazards. The sum of observations concludes that densely populated areas, old settlements, and the central valley have high to very high level of multi-hazard risk.","[Khatakho, Rajesh; Gautam, Dipendra; Pandey, Vishnu Prasad; Lamichhane, Suraj; Talchabhadel, Rocky; Thapa, Bhesh Raj; Adhikari, Rabindra] Interdisciplinary Res Inst Sustainabil, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Khatakho, Rajesh] Mannings Consult Pvt Ltd, Lalitpur 44600, Nepal; [Gautam, Dipendra; Adhikari, Rabindra] Cosmos Coll Management & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Lalitpur 44600, Nepal; [Gautam, Dipendra; Adhikari, Rabindra] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Thapathali Campus, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Gautam, Dipendra; Thapa, Bhesh Raj] Nepal Acad Sci & Technol, Lalitpur 44600, Nepal; [Aryal, Komal Raj; Abdouli, Khameis] Rabdan Acad, Fac Resilience, Abu Dhabi 114646, U Arab Emirates; [Pandey, Vishnu Prasad; Lamichhane, Suraj; Adhikari, Rabindra] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Pulchowk Campus, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Rupakhety, Rajesh] Univ Iceland, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Earthquake Engn Res Ctr, Austuryegur 21, IS-800 Selfoss, Iceland; [Liu, Yi-Chung] Natl Sci & Technol Ctr Disaster Reduct, New Taipei 23143, Taiwan; [Talchabhadel, Rocky] Texas A&M Univ, Texas A&M AgriLife Res, El Paso, TX 79927 USA; [Thapa, Bhesh Raj] Univ Engn & Sci Coll, Dept Civil Engn, Lalitpur 44601, Nepal",,"Gautam, D (corresponding author), Interdisciplinary Res Inst Sustainabil, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal.;Gautam, D (corresponding author), Cosmos Coll Management & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Lalitpur 44600, Nepal.;Gautam, D (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Thapathali Campus, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal.;Gautam, D (corresponding author), Nepal Acad Sci & Technol, Lalitpur 44600, Nepal.",rojuraj1934@gmail.com; dipendra01@tcioe.edu.np; karyal@ra.ac.ae; vishnu.pandey@pcampus.edu.np; rajesh@hi.is; surajlamichhane@ioe.edu.np; ycl@ncdr.nat.gov.tw; kabdouli@ra.ac.ae; rocky.talchabhadel@ag.tamu.edu; bthapa.ioe@gmail.com; rabindraadhi@cosmoscollege.edu.np,,,,,,,,19.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2021,13.0,10,,,,,,,5369,10.3390/su13105369,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13105369,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000662540700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we identified glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region based on multitemporal Landsat images taken from 1990 to 2020. We analyzed the spatial distribution and evolution of glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region from the perspective of their elevation, size, and terrain aspect; then, we described their temporal changes. The results showed that approximately 84.56% of the glacial lakes (84.1% of the total lake area) were located at elevations between 4000 m and 5500 m, and glacial lakes with areas ranging from 0.01-0.5 km(2) accounted for approximately 95.21% of the number and 63.01% of the total area of glacial lakes. The number (38.64%) and area (58.83%) of south-facing glacial lakes were largest in HKH-TMHA and expanded significantly over time. There were 5835 (664.84 +/- 89.72 km(2)) glacial lakes in 1990; from 1990 to 2020, the number of glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region increased by 5974 (408.93 km(2)) in total; and the annual average increase in the area of glacial lakes reached 13.63 km(2) (11.15%). In 2020, the total number of glacial lake reached to 9673 (899.66 +/- 120.63 km(2)). In addition, most glacial lakes were located in the Eastern Himalayan, China, and the Indus Basin. Based on the precipitation and temperature analyses performed in our study area, we found inconsistent climate characteristics and changes in the three mountain ranges. In general, the daily precipitation (temperature) increased by 1.0766 mm (1.0311 degrees C), 0.8544 mm (0.8346 degrees C), and 0.8245 mm (-0.1042 degrees C) on the yearly, summer, and winter scales, respectively.

To correlate the Himalayan seismicity with the landslide hazard, the prepared LSZ map is further assessed in terms of the impact of fault distance on the occurrence and spatial distribution of landslides in the study area. The results quantify a strong inverse correlation between fault distance and the probability of landslide occurrence. A high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.986) indicates that the equation can realistically predict the impact of fault distance on the study area's landslide occurrence. Further, landslide relative frequency (LRF) method is used to evaluate the statistical contribution of fault distance toward overall landslide susceptibility for the study area. It is found that distance from any major tectonic feature is a significant landslide causative parameter, with a relative importance of 21%.

After the earthquake, two field investigations along Araniko Highway were conducted. Then, using remote sensing technology and geographic information system (GIS) technology, 1481 landslides were identified along the Bhote Koshi river. Correlations between the spatial distribution of landslides with slope gradient and lithology were analyzed. The power-law relationship of the size distribution of earthquake-induced landslides was examined in both the Higher Himalaya and Lesser Himalaya. Possible reasons for the variability of the power exponent were explored by examining differences in the geological situations of these areas. Multi-threshold cellular automata were introduced to model the complexity of system components. Most of the landslides occurred at slope gradients of 30 degrees-40 degrees, and the landslide density was positively correlated with slope gradient. Landslides in hard rock areas were more common than in soft rock areas. The cumulative number-area distribution of landslides induced by the Gorkha earthquake exhibited a negative power-law relationship, but the power exponents were different: 1.13 in the Higher Himalaya, 1.36 and Lesser Himalaya. Furthermore, the geological conditions were more complex and varied in the Lesser Himalaya than in the Higher Himalaya, and the cellular automata simulation results indicated that, as the complexity of system components increased, the power exponent increased. Therefore, the variability of the power exponent of landslide size distribution should ascribe to the complexity of geological situations in the Bhote Koshi river watershed.","[Guo Chen-wen; Huang Yi-dan; Yao Ling-kan; Alradi, Helal] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Huang Yi-dan; Yao Ling-kan] Sichuan Key Lab Seism Engn & Technol, Rd & Railway Engn Res Inst, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Huang Yi-dan; Yao Ling-kan] MOE Key Lab High Speed Railway Engn, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,"Huang, YD (corresponding author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Huang, YD (corresponding author), Sichuan Key Lab Seism Engn & Technol, Rd & Railway Engn Res Inst, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Huang, YD (corresponding author), MOE Key Lab High Speed Railway Engn, Chengdu 610031, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",hbgcw1989@163.com; huangyidan@home.swjtu.edu.cn; yaolk@home.swjtu.edu.cn; helalalradi@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,16.0,18.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2017,14.0,10,,,,,1938,1950,,10.1007/s11629-016-4140-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-016-4140-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000412313000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

GLOFs represent a serious threat to downstream inhabitants and ecological environment. In the context of climate warming on the Tibetan Plateau, such GLOFs will continue or even intensify in the future. Remote sensing and statistical methods are often used to diagnose glacial lakes with the highest outburst probability. These methods are efficient in large-scale glacial lake risk assessment but do not take into consideration the complexity of specific glacial lake dynamics and triggering factor uncertainty. Therefore, we explored a novel approach to integrate geophysics, remote sensing, and numerical simulation in glacial lake and GLOF disaster chain assessments. In particular, geophysical techniques are rarely applied to the exploration of glacial lakes. The Namulacuo Lake located in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau is considered as the experimental site. The current status of the lake, including landform construction and identifying potential triggering factors, was first investigated. Secondly, the outburst process and disaster chain effect were evaluated by numerical simulation based on the multi-phase modeling frame proposed by Pudasaini and Mergili (2019) implemented in the open source computational tool r.avaflow. The results allowed verifying that the Namulacuo Lake dam was a landslide dam with an obvious layered structure. Also, the piping-induced flood might have more severe consequences than the short-term ultra-high discharge flood caused by surge. The blocking event caused by a surge disappeared faster than that caused by piping. Therefore, this comprehensive diagnostic approach can assist GLOF researchers to increase their understanding of key challenges they are facing regarding GLOF mechanisms.","[Jiang, Liyang; Fan, Xuanmei; Deng, Yu; Zou, Chengbin; Feng, Zetao; Djukem, Danny Love Wamba; Wei, Tao; Dou, Xiangyang; Xu, Qiang] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Prot, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China",,"Fan, XM (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Prot, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",fxm_cdut@qq.com,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 1,2023,880.0,,,,,,,,163262,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163262,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163262,,APR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000975069400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Snow Covered Area (SCA) is a critical indicator of the ecosystem that influenced the flash flood along different terrain features such as Altitude, Hill-Gradient, and Aspect. GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) technique is used to analyze the possible landslide zones and flood extent along the river basin, and MODIS Terra (MOD10A2) data products derived annual SCA is 4278 km(2) for the year 2021, the analysis of geospatial maps at 25(degrees) intervals of Altitude, hill-gradient, and Aspect.

HillGradient, ranging from 13.06 to 19.52, occupies 24.7% of the total area, and 45.3 to 51.83 are found without snow. The highest variation of SCA is along the Western direction (9.19%), followed by North-East (8.79%), while the least (3.78%) variance is in the Southwest direction. Additionally, it was found that many bridges, roads, and other properties are under threat in this study area, even with a moderate flash flood. Findings from this study provide the spatiotemporal status of SCA in various geological stress conditions during the last decades and probable landslide zones.

Currently, the study of glacial lakes in the Altai Mountains is mainly concerned with the application of high-resolution remote sensing images to monitor and evaluate the potential hazards of glacial lakes. At present, there is no rapid and large-scale method to monitor the dynamical variation in glacial lakes in the Altai Mountains, and there is little research on predicting its future tendency. Based on the supervised classification results obtained by Google Earth Engine (GEE), combined with an analysis of meteorological data, we analyzed the spatial and temporal variations in glacial lakes in the Altai Mountains between 2000 and 2020, and used the MCE-CA-Markov model to predict their changes in the future. According to the results, as of 2020, there are 3824 glacial lakes in the Altai Mountains, with an area of 682.38 km(2). Over the entire period, the glacial lake quantity growth rates and area were 47.82% and 17.07%, respectively. The distribution of glacial lakes in this region showed a larger concentration in the north than in the south. Most glacial lakes had areas smaller than 0.1 km(2), and there was minimal change observed in glacial lakes larger than 0.2 km(2). Analyzing the regional elevation in 100 m intervals, the study found that glacial lakes were predominantly distributed at elevations from 2000 m to 3000 m. Interannual rainfall and temperature fluctuations in the Altai Mountains have slowed since 2014, and the trends for the area and number of glacial lakes have stabilized. The growth of glacial lakes in both number and surface area is expected to continue through 2025 and 2030, although the pace of change will slow. In the context of small increases in precipitation and large increases in temperature, in the future, glacial lakes with faster surface area growth rates will be located primarily in the southern Altai Mountains.","[Wang, Nan; Zhong, Tao; Zheng, Jianghua; Meng, Chengfeng; Liu, Zexuan] Xinjiang Univ, Coll Geog & Remote Sensing Sci, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Jianghua] Xinjiang Univ, Key Lab Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China",,"Zheng, JH (corresponding author), Xinjiang Univ, Coll Geog & Remote Sensing Sci, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China.;Zheng, JH (corresponding author), Xinjiang Univ, Key Lab Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830017, Peoples R China.",wsf@stu.xju.edu.cn; zheng.jianghua@xju.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2023,15.0,14,,,,,,,3689,10.3390/rs15143689,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15143689,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001036710000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These can cause outburst floods that spread destruction far through the mountains and into the lowlands. More than 90 outbursts from impoundments behind such dams have been identified. Of the largest and most destructive, 17 were on the upper Indus River and 10 on the Yarkand. Unlike dangerous lakes recently reported elsewhere in the Himalaya, these events are associated with advancing glaciers, in some cases glacial surges. The lakes are short-lived, rarely surviving more than one summer. Their outburst styles and flood waves exhibit distinctive features. This paper summarizes the behavior and current status of advances of more than a dozen glaciers with histories of large impoundments. Recent developments are assessed in relation to historical records and the Karakoram glacier environment. Destructive outburst floods have already occurred on the Yarkand and may be imminent on the Indus. Problems of predicting dangerous outbursts are outlined, uncertainties raised by limited and mainly older investigations. Implications of global climate change appear different for these hazards in this region than reports of dangerous glacial lakes elsewhere in the Himalaya.","[Hewitt, Kenneth] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Cold Reg Res Ctr, Waterloo, ON N2L 3Z9, Canada; [Liu, Jingshi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",,"Hewitt, K (corresponding author), Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Cold Reg Res Ctr, Waterloo, ON N2L 3Z9, Canada.",,,,,,,,,102.0,104.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV-DEC,2010,31.0,6,,,,,528,551,,10.2747/0272-3646.31.6.528,http://dx.doi.org/10.2747/0272-3646.31.6.528,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000285920400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research is about the landslide risk assessment (LRA) which has not been explored yet in the landslide-prone district Muzaffarabad, Pakistan. Landslide susceptibility (spatial probability) was analyzed using random forest model while landslide hazard (temporal probability) was analyzed using Poisson probability model. A random forest-based landslide susceptibility map depicts an accuracy of 0.90. A landslide hazard map was generated by multiplying the temporal probability with the spatial probability and classified as well. Semi-quantitative danger pixels and a fuzzy set theory approach for LRA have been adopted to estimate future landslide risks in the region. The pixel-based LRA approach indicates that 14, 18 and 20 km(2) area of settlement while, the fuzzy set theory-based approach depicts that 15, 19 and 21 km(2) area of the settlement are under very high landslide risk for 1-, 3-, and 5- year return period respectively. Both approaches produced risk maps that designated various risk zones with almost the same area coverage and results. The LRA maps were classified into five classes including very high (1.99%, 2.33%, 2.80%), high (2.16%, 2.53%, 3.04%), moderate (8.02%, 9.79%, 11.22%), low (17.76%, 22.94%, 23.20%), and very low (70.08%, 62.40%, 59.74%) risk zones for 1, 3 and 5 years return period respectively.

The study aims to evaluate the changes in the landslides, their size, location, and up to some extent, gradual stabilization impacts on susceptibility assessment. The majority of the models, which are developed to analyze landslide susceptibility, use landslide inventory as a dependent variable to compute the predictors' significance. Therefore, a slight change in the landslide dataset nullifies the susceptibility zones. Thus, the landslide susceptibility maps become irrelevant to mitigate slope failures. In the present study, we have used two reference period landslide dataset to execute the landslide susceptibility analysis using the frequency ratio method. The model result was validated with a landslide test dataset using the area under the curve (AUC) method. The AUC value is 0.89 and 0.91 for 2013 and 2019, respectively.

Increasing awareness of climate change over the HKH region is reached a consensus.

During 2000-2016, remarkable ice mass loss caused the mean glacier surface elevation to decrease with a rate of -0.63 m a(-1), and the mean glacier surface velocity slowed by similar to 25% between 1999 and 2015.

Large-scale glacial lakes are developed preferentially and experienced rapid expansion on the east side of the basin, suggesting that in addition to climate warming, the glacial geomorphological characters (aspect and slope) are also key controlling factors of the lake growing process. We hypothesize that lake expansion will continue in some cases until critical local topography (i.e., steepening icefall) is reached, but the lake number may not necessarily increase. Further monitoring should be focused on eight rapidly expanding proglacial lakes due to their high potential risks of failure and relatively high lake volumes.","[Zhong, Yan; Liu, Qiao; Sapkota, Liladhar; Luo, Yunyi; Wang, Han; Liao, Haijun; Wu, Yanhong] Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Yan; Sapkota, Liladhar; Luo, Yunyi; Wang, Han; Liao, Haijun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Yan; Liu, Qiao; Wu, Yanhong] Tribhuvan Univ, Kathmandu Ctr Res & Educ, Chinese Acad Sci, Branch Sustainable Mt Dev, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China",,"Liu, Q (corresponding author), Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Liu, Q (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Kathmandu Ctr Res & Educ, Chinese Acad Sci, Branch Sustainable Mt Dev, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",zhongyan19@mails.ucas.ac.cn; liuqiao@imde.ac.cn; liladhar.767517@cdg.tu.edu.np; luoyunyi20@mails.ucas.ac.cn; wanghan202@mails.ucas.ac.cn; liaohaijun@imde.ac.cn; yhwu@imde.ac.cn,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,13.0,18,,,,,,,3614,10.3390/rs13183614,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13183614,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000701480900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our findings reveal that the study region has 403 glacial lakes with a total area of 55.73 km(2) in 2020. The area of selected glacial lakes has increased from 29.96 km(2) in 1985 to 32.56 km(2) in 2020 at a rate of 0.07 km(2) per year. Twelve (12) lakes were identified as PDGLs in the study region. After applying the weighted index method, 4 lakes among them were categorized as high, 5 as medium and 3 as low hazard glacial lakes. The Mann Kendal test of T-min, T-max and T-mean revealed an increasing trend with a Z statics value of >0, whereas mean precipitation on the contrary showed a significant decreasing trend with a Z statics value of <0. The changes in climatic variables (i.e., temperature and precipitation) indicate that the warmer conditions prevail in the region, causing glacier shrinking and retreat, formation of new lakes and expansion of existing ones. Hence, we propose the continuous monitoring and assessment of high hazard glacial lakes for the prevention and mitigation of Glacier Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in the study region.","[Ahmed, Rayees; Ahmad, Syed Towseef; Wani, Gowhar Farooq; Ahmed, Pervez] Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Geog & Disaster Management, Srinagar, India; [Mir, Riyaz Ahmad] Geol Survey India, Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Almazroui, Mansour] King Abdulaziz Univ, Ctr Excellence Climate Change Res, Dept Meteorol, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Bansal, Joshal Kumar] Natl Inst Hydrol, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Wani, GF (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Geog & Disaster Management, Srinagar, India.",gowhernaz@gmail.com,,,,,,,,5.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 13,2022,37.0,27,,,,,17659,17685,,10.1080/10106049.2022.2134461,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2134461,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000878967300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For the proposed task, 23 representative glaciers were selected from the region, and remotely acquired data from Landsat-TM/ETM/OLI (1991-2017), and Terra-ASTER (2007-2017) along with the SRTM DEMs were used for extraction of the various parameters. Results show that during 1991-2015 the studied glaciers have significantly retreated (17.78 +/- 2.06 m a(-1)), deglaciated (5.44 +/- 0.87%), and experienced a considerable increase in SLA (similar to 7 m a(-)1) and debris cover (16.49 +/- 2.96%). Glaciers slowed-down (by 24.90%) with sizable growth in number (23.81%) and area (48.78 +/- 2.23%) of glacial lakes. They also exhibit a notable downwasting (-0.77 +/- 0.08 m a(-1)) during 2000-2007/17. The behavior of glaciers in the region is heterogeneous and found to be primarily determined by glacier size, debris cover and glacial lakes. Though a generalized mass loss is observed for both small- (<3 km(2)) and large-sized glaciers (>10 km(2)), they seem to adopt different mechanisms to cope with the ongoing climatic changes. While the first adjust mostly by retreat/deglaciation, the latter lose mass through downwasting. Comparing with other Himalayan regions, the magnitude of dimensional changes and debris growth are higher in the Sikkim. The SLA trends are comparable with the central and western Himalaya up to 2000, but a reverse trend is seen afterwards. Also, contrary to the western and central Himalaya, where glaciers are reported to have slowed-down in recent decade, the Sikkim glaciers have shown negligible deceleration after 2000. Climate analysis confirm almost double increase in summer temperature (24.47%) than winters (12.77%) during 1990-2016, which, given the 'summer-accumulation-type' nature of the Sikkim glaciers, seems to be the prime driver of the observed changes.

Among the subject types, maximum climate change impact was studied on water resources/glacier retreat (141 studies) followed by agriculture (113) and forests/biodiversity (86). Increasing temperature, frequent drought spells, erratic rainfall and declining snowfall are commonly reported indicators of climate change. For instance, temperature is reported to increase by 1.5 degrees C in the Himalaya than an average increase of 0.74 degrees C globally in last century; however, it varied in eastern (0.1 degrees C per decade and western Himalayas (0.09 degrees C per decade. An increase in temperature between 0.28 and 0.80 degrees C per decade was reported for North-western Himalaya and 0.20-1.00 degrees C per decade for Eastern Himalaya. The higher altitude of Himalayan and Trans-Himalayan zone are reported to be warming at higher rates. Many of the glaciers were reported to be retreating in both eastern and western Himalaya.

For this study, the landslide inventories were derived from the pre- and post-Chamoli earthquake (1999). Landslide inventory includes 220 landslides that occurred before the Chamoli earthquake, considered as rainfall-induced landslides (RIL) and 56 earthquake-induced landslides (EIL). The variation between landslides' spatial distribution and controlling parameters for both cases, i.e. RIL and EIL, are assessed and compared.

Availability of cheaper high resolution satellite data from Indian remote sensing satellites enables us to create up-to-date inventory for use in prioritisation of glacial lakes for GLOF risk assessment. Earlier inventories show presence of more glacial lakes in Brahmaputra basin in Indian Himalaya. Teesta River is one of the tributary of Brahmaputra and previous studies have shown that the inventory of glacial lakes in Teesta basin varies from 143 to 320. In the present study, the inventory carried out using satellite data of years 2000, 2007 and 2014 show presence of 301 (25.789 km(2)), 302 (26.081 km(2)) and 644 (29.706 km(2)) glacial lakes in Teesta basin respectively. The steep increase in number of lakes in the latest inventory is primarily due to the finer spatial resolution of satellite data used. Analysis of water spread area of glacial lakes at different altitudes shows that most of the lakes in the higher altitudes are small in size. It is observed that more than 66% of lakes are in the altitude beyond 4500 m and of size less than 50,000 sqm (5 ha). Out of 301 glacial lakes inventoried during 2000, water spread area of 6 lakes have decreased in 2014 and 31 lakes have shown increase in area. Out of these 31 lakes, 17 lakes are classified as end moraine dammed lakes and among them, 14 are located in Upper Teesta sub-basin and in higher altitudes (beyond 5000 m).

Given the uncertainties of magnitude and characteristics of climate change, prior knowledge of long-term changing distribution pattern of forests is of crucial importance. Owing to the heterogeneity of the Himalayan mountain system, knowledge on potential impacts on forests makes it a paramount concern in this region. Therefore, to understand vulnerability as a prerequisite for forest management, we systematically review and synthesize peer-reviewed literature on climate change impacts of the Himalayan forests (n = 118). Of the reviewed articles, 91.5% were published after 2009. Our findings emphasize that due to a wide variety of disciplinary domains, the conceptual, methodological, and subsequent findings (observed and predicted) vary greatly given the complexity of the theme of the review. Most assessments addressing climate change vulnerability of forests and forest-dependent people fail to acknowledge the importance of scalar and temporal aspects of vulnerability. In addition, despite the brevity of the phenomena, much lesser is known about adaptation potentials, planning and policy initiatives, and coordinated multi-disciplinary decision making for managing forest resources and dependent livelihood options under different climate change scenarios.

The increased melting has enhanced the susceptibility for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in the region. The catastrophic failure of potentially dangerous glacial lakes could be detrimental to human life and infrastructure in the adjacent low-lying areas. This study attempts to assess the GLOF hazard of Gangabal lake, located in the Upper Jhelum basin of Kashmir Himalaya, using the combined approaches of remote sensing, GIS, and dam break modeling. The parameters, such as area change, ice thickness, mass balance, and surface velocity of the Harmukh glacier, which feeds Gangabal lake, were also assessed using multitemporal satellite data, GlabTop-2, and the Cosi-Corr model. In the worst-case scenario, 100% volume (73 x 10(6) m(3)) of water was considered to be released from the lake with a breach formation time (bf) of 40 min, breach width (bw) of 60 m, and producing peak discharge of 16,601.03 m(3)/s. Our results reveal that the lake area has increased from 1.42 km(2) in 1972 to 1.46 km(2) in 1981, 1.58 km(2) in 1992, 1.61 km(2) in 2001, 1.64 km(2) in 2010, and 1.66 km(2) in 2020. The lake area experienced 17 +/- 2% growth from 1972 to 2020 at an annual rate of 0.005 km(2). The feeding glacier (Harmukh) contrarily indicated a significant area loss of 0.7 +/- 0.03 km(2) from 1990 (3.36 km(2)) to 2020 (2.9 km(2)). The glacier has a maximum, minimum, and average depth of 85, 7.3, and 23.46 m, respectively. In contrast, the average velocity was estimated to be 3.2 m/yr with a maximum of 7 m/yr. The results obtained from DEM differencing show an average ice thickness loss of 11.04 +/- 4.8 m for Harmukh glacier at the rate of 0.92 +/- 0.40 m/yr between 2000 and 2012. Assessment of GLOF propagation in the worst-case scenario (scenario-1) revealed that the maximum flood depth varies between 3.87 and 68 m, the maximum flow velocity between 4 and 75 m/s, and the maximum water surface elevation varies between 1548 and 3536 m. The resultant flood wave in the worst-case scenario will reach the nearest location (Naranaag temple) within 90 min after breach initiation with a maximum discharge of 12,896.52 m(3) s(-1) and maximum flood depth and velocity of 10.54 m and 10.05 m/s, respectively. After evaluation of GLOF impacts on surrounding areas, the area under each inundated landuse class was estimated through the LULC map generated for both scenarios 1 and 2. In scenario 1, the total potentially inundated area was estimated as 5.3 km(2), which is somewhat larger than 3.46 km(2) in scenario 2.

Large landslides are predominant in this region. A giant landslide called Jiaobunong landslide on the northwestern flank of the EHS were studied and simulated to investigate the formation mechanism, evolutionary process, and failure mechanism of the landside, so that we could better understand the large complex ancient landslides in this region. Field investigation, geological background analyses, and numerical modeling were conducted to reveal the natural and seismic characteristics, as well as dynamic process of the landslide. The results show that the Jiaobunong landslide was the result of long-term geological and geomorphic evolution. Uplift, river incision, weathering, fault creep, glaciation, and earthquakes play key roles in the formation of landslides. Given the huge landslide volume, strong seismicity of the study area, proximity to an active fault, and the need for extra forces to induce landsliding, the Jiaobunong landslide was triggered by a paleo-earthquake. Using numerical simulation based on the discrete element method, the slope dynamic response of the earthquake as well as the mass movement and accumulation process was reproduced. Simulation results showed that the landslide movement experienced four stages: initiation phase (0-5 s), acceleration phase (5-35 s), deceleration phase (35-95 s), and the compaction and self-stabilization stage (after 95 s). The rock mass was disintegrated and experienced strong collisions during the movement. The dammed lake gradually disappeared because of long-term river incision by the overtopping river water. These processes play a vital role in the evolution of landforms in the region of EHS.","[Du, Guo-liang; Yuan, Ying] Hebei GEO Univ, Shijiazhuang 050031, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Du, Guo-liang; Yuan, Ying] Hebei GEO Univ, Key Lab Intelligent Detect & Equipment Undergroun, Minist Nat Resources, Shijiazhuang 050031, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yong-shuang] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Hydrogeol & Environm Geol, Shijiazhuang 050061, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xin; Yang, Zhi-hua] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geomech, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, YS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Hydrogeol & Environm Geol, Shijiazhuang 050061, Hebei, Peoples R China.",756591925@qq.com; zhys100@hotmail.com; yaoxinphd@163.com; yangzh99@163.com; 275596117@qq.com,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2021,18.0,12,,,,,3230,3246,,10.1007/s11629-020-6617-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-020-6617-y,,NOV 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000722823300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, the northeastern part of the Himalaya, severely affected by landslides every monsoon, is poorly studied. The information on the inventories is inhomogeneous and lacking. In this context, satellite-based earth observation data, which has significantly advanced in the last decade and often serves as a potential source for data collection, monitoring, and damage assessment for disasters in a short time span, has been implemented. Keeping in mind the above framework, this study aims to exploit the potentials of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical imagery for identifying new landslides in vegetated and hilly areas of the northeastern part of India. In order to assess the potentials of our data and methodology, a landslide event which occurred on 13 August 2016 13:30 h (IST) in North Sikkim, India, triggered due to rainfall has been explored in detail. The landslide also resulted in the formation of a lake, 2.2 km in length and 290 m in width. Difficulty in procurement of cloud-free datasets immediately after the event led us to the use of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data, to assess its potential for this purpose. It is observed that the potential of SAR amplitude imagery is limited to different aspects as per the sensor look direction during the mode of acquisition. Furthermore, the present study also incorporates a change detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of the Sudden Landslide Identification Product (SLIP) model to identify new landslides using Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. Overall, the results exhibit that integrated usage of both optical and SAR amplitude imagery may provide a plethora of information for identification and mapping of new landslides for damage assessment and early warning. All the above results combined together suggest this method for rapid identification of landslides in the Himalayan terrain with special emphasis on the northeastern part of the Himalaya. The automation of this method for future operational usage is also suggested.","[Sivasankar, Thota] NIIT Univ, Neemrana, Rajasthan, India; [Ghosh, Swakangkha] Indian Sch Mines, Indian Inst Technol, Dhanbad 826004, Jharkhand, India; [Joshi, Mayank] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Sikkim Reg Ctr, Gangtok, Sikkim, India",,"Ghosh, S (corresponding author), Indian Sch Mines, Indian Inst Technol, Dhanbad 826004, Jharkhand, India.",siva.iirs@gmail.com; swakangkhaghosh23@gmail.com; mayank.geo@gmail.com,,,,,,,,12.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2021,193.0,7,,,,,,,386,10.1007/s10661-021-09119-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09119-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000757330700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we integrate the insights gained from ensemble modelling with the community ecology data on threatened Himalayan Trillium (Trillium govanianum) to identify the suitable sites for its habitat restoration. We used ensemble modelling to map the current potential distribution and predict the future suitable habitats for the species under future climate change scenarios. The predictive accuracy of the ensemble model was fairly good; and the most influential variables governing the distribution of Himalayan Trillium were precipitation of the driest month followed by mean diurnal range. The current potential suitable habitats for this species are mostly located in western parts of the Himalaya; however, a range shift from western to eastern Himalaya is predicted under future climate change scenarios. Further, the results of community data revealed that Himalayan Trillium is positively associated with two tree species (Abies pindrow and Taxus wallichiana) forming forest top-story, four understory shrubs (Viburnum grandiflorum, Parrotiopsis jacquemontiana, Skimmia laureola and Rhododendron campanulatum) and one herbaceous species (Podophyllum hexandrum). In particular, the shrubs serve as natural micro-refuges by facilitating the suitable growth and protect the species from unsustainable extraction and livestock grazing. Our findings highlight a two-pronged strategy for habitat restoration of Himalayan Trillium: (i) identification of suitable habitats using ensemble modelling at the pan-Himalayan scale, (ii) and its integration with the community information at local scale. Such an integrated approach offers a nature-based solution in guiding the climate change-integrated restoration programs in the Himalaya, and elsewhere in the world.","[Rather, Zubair Ahmad; Ahmad, Rameez; Khuroo, Anzar Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Ctr Biodivers & Taxon, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Dar, Tanvir-Ul-Hassan] BGSB Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Rajouri 185234, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Rather, ZA; Khuroo, AA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Ctr Biodivers & Taxon, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",zubairrather4@gmail.com; anzarak@uok.edu.in,,,,,,,,33.0,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022,176.0,,,,,,,,106534,10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106534,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106534,,JAN 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000807886600021,View Full Record in Web of Science

These mountains modify the regional climate in complex ways; the ecosystem services they provide influence the lives of almost 1 billion people in 8 countries. However, our understanding of these ecosystems remains rudimentary. The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that erroneously predicted a date for widespread glacier loss exposed how little was known of Himalayan glaciers. Recent research shows how variably glaciers respond to climate change in different Himalayan regions. Alarmist theories are not new. In the 1980s, the Theory of Himalayan Degradation warned of complete forest loss and devastation of downstream areas, an eventuality that never occurred. More recently, the debate on hydroelectric construction appears driven by passions rather than science. Poor data, hasty conclusions, and bad science plague Himalayan research.

This study analyzed and for the first time modeled a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) event in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh. Glacier and glacial lakes changes were quantified using remote sensing data supplemented with field observations. Glacier ice-thickness and glacier-bed overdeepenings were modeled using a shear-stress based model, GlabTop (Glacier-bed Topography). The reconstruction of the 2014 GLOF and the potential hazard assessment of Gya Lake were carried out using the hydrodynamic model HEC-RAS; results were validated against ground-collected data. Temporal evaluation of satellite data revealed a 45.6% loss in the total glacier area between 1969 and 2019. The earliest snow-free image available for the region shows that a progladal lake existed as early as 1969 with an area of 3.06 ha. The lake has expanded to similar to 11 ha in 2019. Results from the GlabTop model suggest that the lake could grow further up to 12 ha in the future. Field-based geomorphic indicators suggest that the 2014 GLOF event resulted from a piping failure of the frontal moraine destroying numerous agricultural fields, some buildings, downstream infrastructure, and eroded natural channel embankments. The reconstruction of the event revealed that 25% of the lake waters drained out with a peak discharge of 470 m(3) s(-1) , inundating an area of similar to 4 km(2) around Gya Village. However, a complete breaching of the terminal moraine could result in an event that would be 5.5 times larger than the 2014 GLOF. Therefore, this study could be useful not only in planning disaster-resilient infrastructure around proglacial lake environments in the cold-arid Ladakh but also in framing mitigation plans to reduce risk for vulnerable downstream communities.

The area famous for tourism constitutes > 7000 buildings with similar to 30,000 habitations. Four bivariate statistical approaches viz. Weight of evidence (WoE), Frequency ratio (FR), Yule Coefficient (YC), and Information Value (InV) were used for landslide hazard assessment, and all these approaches with 75%-80% success and predication rate are found to be acceptable for landslide hazard mapping. The analyses indicate that the Nagar Palika Parisad ward, Library ward, Happy valley ward and Bhadraj ward exhibit the maximum area falling under the high and very high landslide hazard zones, whereas Landaur ward, Jalkii ward and Indra Colony ward exhibit a greater part of the area in the low and very low hazard zones. On the basis of the six elements at risk present in the study area viz. settlement, crop land, water body, roads, barren and degraded land, and dense forest, the similar to 40% of the area is very high and high vulnerable, similar to 11% moderate, and similar to 49% is low and very low vulnerable. High and very high vulnerable zones are located in the west and central portion mainly because of higher habitation and more anthropogenic activities.

Worryingly, the situation is alarming for endemic and medicinally important plant species with a narrow distributional range. Therefore, it is pivotal to inspect the influence of accelerated climate change on medicinally important threatened and endemic plant species. Using an ensemble approach, the current study aims at modelling the present distribution and predicting the future potential distribution coupled with the threat assessment of Swertia petiolata-a medicinally important endemic plant species in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. Our study revealed that under current climatic scenarios, the suitable habitats for the species occur across the western Himalayan region which includes the north-western Indian states (Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and southern Uttarakhand), northern Pakistan, and north-western Nepal. Also, temperature seasonality (BIO4) and precipitation seasonality (BIO15) are the most significant bioclimatic variables determining the distribution of S. petiolata. Furthermore, the study projected a reduction in the suitable habitats for the species under future changing climatic scenarios with a reduction ranging from - 40.298% under RCP4.5 2050 to - 83.421% under RCP8.5 2070. Most of the habitat reduction will occur in the western Himalayan region. In contrast, some of the currently unsuitable Himalayan regions like northern Uttarakhand will show increasing suitability under climate change scenarios. The current study also revealed that S. petiolata is classified as Near Threatened (NT) following the IUCN criterion B. Hopefully, the present study will provide a robust tool for predicting the cultivation hotspots and devising scientifically effective conservation strategies for this medicinally important plant species in the Himalaya and similar environments elsewhere in the world.","[Wani, Bilal Ahmad; Magray, Junaid Ahmad; Nawchoo, Irshad Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Phytochemistry Res Lab, Plant Reprod Biol, Srinagar 190006, India; [Wani, Sajad Ahmad; Ahmad, Rameez] Univ Kashmir, Ctr Biodivers & Taxon, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, India; [Ganie, Aijaz Hassan] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, India",,"Wani, BA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Phytochemistry Res Lab, Plant Reprod Biol, Srinagar 190006, India.",biobilal968@gmail.com,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2023,195.0,1,,,,,,,214,10.1007/s10661-022-10773-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10773-7,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000901723800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet, landslide-prone areas are all located in China and Nepal, imposing alarming risks of widespread damages to property and loss of human life in both countries. Against this backdrop, this research, by utilizing remote sensing images and topographic maps, has identified a total number of 6877 landslides for the past 23 years and further examined their distribution, characteristics and causes. Analysis shows that the two-step topography in the Himalayan region has a considerable effect on the distribution of landslides in this area. Dense distribution of landslides falls into two regions: the Lesser Himalaya (mostly small and medium size landslides in east-west direction) and the Transition Belt (mostly large and medium size landslides along the river in north-south direction). Landslides decrease against the elevation while the southern slopes of the Himalayas have more landslides than its northern side. Change analysis was carried out by comparing landslide distribution data of 1992, 2010 and 2015 in the Koshi River basin. The rainfall-induced landslides, usually small and shallow and occurring more frequently in regions with an elevation lower than 1000m, are common in the south and south-east slopes due to heavy precipitation in the region, and are more prone to the slope gradient of 20 degrees similar to 30 degrees. Most of them are distributed in Proterozoic stratum (Pt-3 epsilon, Pt-3 and Pt2-3) and Quaternary stratum.

The present study evaluates the hazard potential of the South Lhonak lake located in the state of Sikkim, using both one and two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling approaches. Different breach parameters were calculated based on the lake bathymetry and moraine dimensions. The worst-case GLOF scenario is revealed during an overtopping failure of the moraine, producing a peak flood of 6064.6 m(3)s(-1) and releasing a total water volume of 25.7 x 10(6)m(3). The GLOF hydrograph is routed to calculate peak flood (m(3)s(-1)), inundation depth (m) and flow velocity (ms(-1)) along the main flow channel. The interaction of the flood wave with a major topographic obstruction located 15.6 km downstream of the lake, shows a significant reduction of the flow energy leading to a minimization of the South Lhonak GLOF impact. The flood wave reaches the nearest town Lachen, located at a distance of 46 km downstream from the lake, at 3 h 38 min after the initiation of the breach, with a peak flood of 3928.16 m(3)s (-1)and a maximum flow velocity of 13.6 ms(-1). At Chungthang town, located at a distance of 62.35 km from South Lhonak lake, the flood wave potentially inundates settlements along the bank of the flow channel, where a peak flood of 3828.08 m(3)s(-1) is reached after 4 h of the initial dam breach event. The study also incorporates modeling of a framework to propose a potential flood remediation measure of the South Lhonak lake GLOF by demonstrating the effect of a lateral inline structure along the flow channel, to check the flow of the potential flood wave.

As a product of climate change and global warming, such a risk has not only raised the level of threats to the habitation and infrastructure of the region, but has also contributed to the worsening of the balance of the unique ecosystem that exists in this domain that sustains several of the highest mountain peaks of the world. This study attempts to present an up to date mapping of the MDGLs in the central and eastern Himalayan regions using remote sensing data, with an objective to analyse their surface area variations with time from 1990 through 2015, disaggregated over six episodes. The study also includes the evaluation for susceptibility of MDGLs to GLOF with the least criteria decision analysis (LCDA). Forty two major MDGLs, each having a lake surface area greater than 0.2 km2, that were identified in the Himalayan ranges of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim, have been categorized according to their surface area expansion rates in space and time. The lakes have been identified as located within the elevation range of 3800 m and 6800 m above mean sea level (a msl). With a total surface area of 37.9 km2, these MDGLs as a whole were observed to have expanded by an astonishing 43.6% in area over the 25 year period of this study. A factor is introduced to numerically sort the lakes in terms of their relative yearly expansion rates, based on their interpretation of their surface area extents from satellite imageries. Verification of predicted GLOF events in the past using this factor with the limited field data as reported in literature indicates that the present analysis may be considered a sufficiently reliable and rapid technique for assessing the potential bursting susceptibility of the MDGLs. The analysis also indicates that, as of now, there are eight MDGLs in the region which appear to be in highly vulnerable states and have high chances in causing potential GLOF events anytime in the recent future.","[Begam, Sazeda] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Sch Water Resources, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Sen, Dhrubajyoti] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",,"Begam, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Sch Water Resources, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",sbsazeda@swr.iitkgp.ac.in; djsen@civil.iitkgp.ac.in,,,,,,,,15.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2019,16.0,1,,,,,77,94,,10.1007/s11629-018-5023-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-018-5023-1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000456251500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results of the current study revealed that, under current climatic conditions, the northwest states of India (Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and the northern part of Uttarakhand), the eastern and southern parts of Pakistan Himalaya have highly suitable climatic conditions for the growth of A. fragrans. The ensemble model exhibited high forecast accuracy, with temperature seasonality and precipitation seasonality as the main climatic variables responsible for the distribution of the A. fragrans in the biodiversity hotspot. Furthermore, the study predicted that future climate change scenarios will diminish habitat suitability for the species by -46.9% under RCP4.5 2050 and -55.0% under RCP4.5 2070. Likewise, under RCP8.5, the habitat suitability will decrease by -51.7% in 2050 and -94.3% in 2070. The current study also revealed that the western Himalayan area will show the most habitat loss.

Hopefully, the current approach may provide a robust technique and showcases a model with learnings for predicting cultivation hotspots and developing scientifically sound conservation plans for this endangered medicinal plant in the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot.","[Bhat, Irshad Ahmad; Fayaz, Mudasir; Rafiq, Shah; Qadir, Jasfeeda A.; Wani, Tareq A.; Kaloo, Zahoor] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Plant Tissue Culture Res Lab, Srinagar 190006, J&K, India; [Roof-ul-Qadir] Univ Kashmir, Plant Reprod Biol Genet Divers & Phytochem Res Lab, Srinagar 190006, J&K, India; [Guleria, Khushboo] Lovely Profess Univ, Sch Biosci & Bioengn, Dept Zool, Phagwara 144411, Punjab, India",,"Bhat, IA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Plant Tissue Culture Res Lab, Srinagar 190006, J&K, India.",irshadayoub0@gmail.com,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2023,195.0,5,,,,,,,623,10.1007/s10661-023-11245-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11245-2,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000980449300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The landslide susceptibility maps can play an important role in human development and sustainable environment management in Darjeeling Himalayan. The present research focused on preparing the effective landslide susceptible models using different statistical probabilistic methods, namely landslide nominal susceptibility factor (LNSF), information value (InfoVal) and certainty factor (CF) models. Experiments have been carried out in Kurseong region, a part of Darjeeling Himalaya as a field of this research. Landslide sites were identified from previous records through extensive field survey and Google pro satellite imagery. Totally, 273 landslide sites were compiled and prepared the inventory map. Out of 273 landslides, 70% were used for training and 30% were used for validating the models. Seventeen landslide conditioning factors were selected for modeling landslide susceptibility, i.e., elevation, aspect, slope degree, rainfall, geological structure, geomorphologic division, lineament, land use/land cover, distance to roads, earthquake zone, soil texture, soil depth, normalized difference vegetation index, drainage density, stream power index and topographic wetness index. The produced susceptibility maps were validated using the receiver's operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The prediction accuracy of LNSF, InfoVal and CF models as per ROC are 80.78%, 82.91% and 86.13%, respectively. The CF achieved the highest accuracy (86.13%), while the LNSF produced the lowest ROC value (80.78%). However, the comparison of the produced landslide maps revealed that all the applied models have good precision for studying susceptibility of landslide in Kurseong and its surrounding of Darjeeling Himalaya, India. The findings of current study can be supportive for the mitigation of landslide risk in the Kurseong range as well as the surrounding comparable areas having same geoenvironmental conditions.","[Saha, Anik; Saha, Sunil] Univ Gour Banga, Dept Geog, Malda, W Bengal, India",,"Saha, S (corresponding author), Univ Gour Banga, Dept Geog, Malda, W Bengal, India.",aniksahamalda@gmail.com; sunilgeo.88@gmail.com,,,,,,,,19.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2021,23.0,3,,,,,4453,4483,,10.1007/s10668-020-00783-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00783-1,,MAY 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000559616600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The area is also well known for frequent and heavy rain storms and climate-induced catastrophic events, such as flash floods due to the unprecedented rains in the Bhutan Himalaya. Therefore, climate-induced disasters like floods have been the prime reasons for rural vulnerabilities. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study is to find out whether there are any differences between levels of vulnerability amidst agriculture-dependent villages and forest resource-dependent villages in the same flood-prone area or not. In addition, the study will also examine how the agriculture-dependent villages are different from forest resource-dependent villages in terms of climate vulnerability and vice versa. The climate change vulnerability index has been applied, and a total of 100 households have been surveyed covering seven dimensions of vulnerability. The exposure score was found to be the highest in Raja Bhatkhawa (0.41) followed by Nathuar Char (0.30) and Bhelakoba (0.27). No significant differences were found in terms of climatic exposure except in Mendabari. Further, it has been observed that the resilience factors in households like education, workforce opportunities, health, and institutional accessibility are highly uneven, which has been creating hinders to the adaptive capacity. In the villages where overall vulnerability to climate change was found to be high, the adaptive capacity was found to be low. Simultaneously, in those villages, the sensitivity was found to be high. It has been found that the location of the villages plays an important role when it comes to vulnerability because the forest villages are relatively more vulnerable than the agricultural villages. However, the riverside location of Nathuar Char has made this village highly vulnerable; and the people of Nathuar Char have been living with floods, and they are trying to adapt with climate-induced floods. Finally, it has been observed that vulnerability is context dependent (i.e. based on land resources, accessibility to basic infrastructure, water and sanitation facilities, and awareness to disasters) and varies from household to household.","[Ghosh, Manoranjan; Ghosal, Somnath] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Rural Dev Ctr, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",,"Ghosh, M (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Rural Dev Ctr, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",ghoshmanoranjan.99@gmail.com; somnath@iitkgp.ac.in,,,,,,,,33.0,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,23.0,2,,,,,2570,2595,,10.1007/s10668-020-00687-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00687-0,,MAR 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000521875600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The SPOT-5 satellite image was used to develop a landslide inventory which was subsequently verified in the field. The landslide causative factors of topographic attributes (slope and aspect), geology, landcover, distances from fault, road and streams were used to evaluate their influence on the spatial distribution of landslides. The study revealed that the distance to road, slope gradient has the significant influence on the spatial distribution of the landslides, followed by the geology.

The state of stress accumulation beneath the Sikkim-Bhutan Himalaya and its spatial correlation with seismicity remains unclear due to the lack of geodetic measurements and the low levels of seismic activity. We compile Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements in southern Tibet with the available velocities in the Sikkim-Bhutan Himalaya to reveal the characteristics of strain buildup on the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). We correct non-tectonic hydrological loading effects in a GPS time series to accurately determine the Three-Dimensional (3D) velocities of each continuous station. Extensive GPS measurements yield convergence rates of 16.2 similar to 18.5 mm/y across the Sikkim-Bhutan Himalaya, which is quite consistent with that observed elsewhere in the Himalaya. Based on a double-ramp structure of the MHT, a refined 3D coupling image is inverted using a dense network of GPS velocities. The result indicates significant along-strike variations of fault coupling beneath the Sikkim-Bhutan Himalaya. The locking width (coupling > 0.5) of western Bhutan reaches similar to 100 km, which is 30 similar to 40% wider than Sikkim and eastern Bhutan. An obvious embayment of decoupling zone near the border between Sikkim and western Bhutan is recognized, and coincides spatially with the rupture terminates of the 1934 Mw8.2 and the 1714 M7.5 similar to 8.5 earthquakes, indicating that the large megathrust earthquakes along the Sikkim-Bhutan Himalaya are largely segmented by the spatial variation of frictional properties on the MHT. Using a new compilation of seismic records in the Sikkim-Bhutan Himalaya, we analyze the spatial correlation between fault coupling and seismic activity. The result suggests that the seismicity in the Bhutan Himalaya is broadly distributed, instead of restricted in the lower edge of the interseismic locking zone. This implies that the seismic activity in the Bhutan Himalaya is not uniquely controlled by the stress accumulation at the downdip end of the locked portion of the MHT.","[Li, Shuiping; Tao, Tingye; Gao, Fei; Qu, Xiaochuan; Zhu, Yongchao; Huang, Jianwei] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuiping; Wang, Qi] China Univ Geosci, Inst Geophys & Geomat, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Li, Shuiping] State Key Lab Geodesy & Earths Dynam, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China",,"Tao, TY (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Hefei 230009, Peoples R China.",lishuiping@hfut.edu.cn; taotingye@hfut.edu.cn; gaofei@hfut.edu.cn; qqxxcc@hfut.edu.cn; yczhu@hfut.edu.cn; hjw1028@hfut.edu.cn; wangqi@cug.edu.cn,,,,,,,,8.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2020,12.0,14,,,,,,,2202,10.3390/rs12142202,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12142202,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000558268400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We reviewed published information of the likely health consequences of climate change in mountain regions, especially the findings of a workshop for countries in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region, organized by the World Health Organization, World Meteorological Organization, United Nations Environment Programme, and United Nations Development Programme. The main climate-related risks in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya region include the expansion of vector-borne diseases as pathogens take advantage of new habitats in altitudes that were formerly unsuitable. Diarrheal diseases could become more prevalent with changes in freshwater quality and availability. More extreme rainfall events are likely to increase the number of floods and landslides with consequent death and injuries. A unique risk is sudden floods from high glacier lakes, which cause substantial destruction and loss of life. Because glaciers are the main source of freshwater for upland regions and downstream countries, the long-term reduction in annual glacier snowmelt is expected to heighten existing water insecurity in these areas. Climate change also is bringing some benefits to mountain populations, including milder winters and longer growing seasons. Populations in mountain regions have unique combinations of vulnerabilities to climate change.

They are prone to various hazards such as drought, flood, forest fire, landslide and therefore physical, ecological and social systems of the mountains are at risk. Climate change adds to intensifying the magnitude of multi-hazard risk in mountains. The present study attempts to evaluate risk induced by multi-hazard and climate change in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework. The proposed multi-hazard risk index was based on indicators from a broader domain and applied on 109 administrative districts of IHR. Exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and coping capacity were defined using comprehensive and sub-regional indicators identified through inductive and deductive approaches. The result showed that the differential risks among the districts of IHR were governed by the multiplicity of the factor such as demography, amenities, natural capital, partnership, technology and spatial specificities of the districts. The result highlighted the need of inclusion of spatial specificities for the risk mitigation in the IHR and therefore a Mountain Specific Risk Management Framework (MSMRMF) was proposed for sustaining the mountainous communities. The proposed MSMRMF contained two broad components as risk assessment and risk addressal. The framework detailed the risk mitigation and coping strategies (based on adjustment of internal and external strengths) for addressing risks. Risk mitigation was proposed to achieved through habitation resilience, natural capital enhancement, external partnerships, climate change adaptation, and technological interventions.

Safed Lake is one of the largest glacial lakes, located at an elevation 4882 m a.s.l. in the state of Uttarakhand, central Himalaya, India. A temporal analysis of the lake surface using satellite imagery shows that the lake has grown more than double its size from 0.10 km(2) to 0.23 km(2) over the past 50 years. In this study, we performed a hazard assessment of the lake using 1D and 2D hydrodynamic modeling. We identified the potential glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) triggering factors and evaluated the impact of a moraine breach event of the lake on the nearest village located 16.2 km downstream of the lake. A series of dynamic simulations were performed for different scenario-models based on varied breach depths, breach widths and time of moraine failure. In a worst-case GLOF scenario where breach depth reached up to 60 m, hydrodynamic routing of the breach hydrograph along the given channel revealed inundation depth up to 5 m and flow velocities up to 3.2 m s(-1) at Milam village. Considering the flat geometry of the frontal moraine, hazard assessment of the lake was performed by for different breach incision depths (30 and 15 m). In addition, the study incorporated a series of hydrodynamic routing to understand the sensitivity of GLOF to different model input parameters and terrain conditions. The sensitivity of the initial GLOF hydrograph to breach formation time (T-f) was evaluated by considering different hypothetical breach scenarios with a varied time of failure. Increases of 11.5% and 22% in the peak flooding were recorded when the moraine failure time was decreased by 15 and 30 min respectively. The two-dimensional sensitivity revealed flow velocity (m s(-1)) to be more sensitive to change in Manning's N when compared to the inundation depth (m). Changes of 10.7% and 0.5% in the mean flow velocity (in m s(-1)) and flow depth (in m) were recorded when dN was 0.01. The flow velocity was more sensitive to the slope and the top-width of the channel when compared to the inundation depths. A regression of flow velocity versus slope gives a correlation coefficient of 0.76. GLOF flow hydraulics are sensitive to changes in terrain elevation, where flow depth and velocity vary in a similar manner.","[Sattar, Ashim; Goswami, Ajanta] Indian Inst Technol, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kulkarni, Anil, V] Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Emmer, Adam] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Brno 60300, Czech Republic",,"Sattar, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",ashim.sattar@gmail.com; ajantagoswami@gmail.com; anilkulkarni@iisc.ac.in; aemmer@seznam.cz,,,,,,,,20.0,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2020,12.0,1,,,,,,,237,10.3390/w12010237,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12010237,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000519847200237,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, an integrated understanding of the debris-free and debris-covered glacier evolution and its interaction with glacial lake is still lacking. Using one case study in the Gyirong River Basin located in the central Himalayas, this paper applied archival Landsat imagery and an automated mapping method to understand how glaciers and glacial lakes interactively evolved between 1988 and 2015. Our analyses identified 467 glaciers in 1988, containing 435 debris-free and 32 debris-covered glaciers, with a total area of 614.09 +/- 36.69 km(2). These glaciers decreased by 16.45% in area from 1988 to 2015, with an accelerated retreat rate after 1994. Debris-free glaciers retreated faster than debris-covered glaciers. As a result of glacial downwasting, supraglacial debris coverage expanded upward by 17.79 km2 (24.44%). Concurrent with glacial retreat, glacial lakes increased in both number (+41) and area (+54.11%). Glacier-connected lakes likely accelerated the glacial retreat via thermal energy transmission and contributed to over 15% of the area loss in their connected glaciers. On the other hand, significant glacial retreats led to disconnections from their proglacial lakes, which appeared to stabilize the lake areas. Continuous expansions in the lakes connected with debris-covered glaciers, therefore, need additional attention due to their potential outbursts. In comparison with precipitation variation, temperature increase was the primary driver of such glacier and glacial lake changes. In addition, debris coverage, size, altitude, and connectivity with glacial lakes also affected the degree of glacial changes and resulted in the spatial heterogeneity of glacial wastage across the Gyirong River Basin.","[Jiang, Sheng; Liu, Xiangyang; Xu, Xia] Sichuan Normal Univ, Fac Geog & Resource Sci, Chengdu 610101, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Sheng; Nie, Yong; Liu, Qiao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Nie, Yong; Liu, Qiao] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiao] SinoNepal Joint Res Ctr Geog, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jida] Kansas State Univ, Dept Geog, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Liu, Linshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Hassan, Javed] Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Gilgit Baltistan 15100, Pakistan",,"Nie, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Nie, Y (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",jiangsheng230@163.com; nieyong@imde.ac.cn; liuqiao@imde.ac.cn; jidawang@ksu.edu; liuls@igsnrr.ac.cn; javed.hassan@kiu.edu.pk; liuxiangyang1992@foxmail.com; xuxiabnu@126.com,,,,,,,,32.0,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2018,10.0,7,,,,,,,986,10.3390/rs10070986,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10070986,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000440332500009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Additionally, attempts are also made to harness hydropower by constructing tunnels, dams and reservoirs and thus altering vulnerable slopes at many places. As a result, the overall risk due to landslide hazards has increased many folds and, therefore, an attempt was made to assess landslide susceptibility using 'Weights of Evidence (WofE)', a well-known bivariate statistical modelling technique implemented in a much improved way using remote sensing and Geographic Information System. This methodology has dual advantage as it demonstrates how to derive critical parameters related to geology, geomorphology, slope, land use and most importantly temporal landslide distribution in one of the data scarce region of the world. Secondly, it allows to experiment with various combination of parameters to assess their cumulative effect on landslides. In total, 15 parameters related to geology, geomorphology, terrain, hydrology and anthropogenic factors and 2 different landslide inventories (prior to 2007 and 2008-2011) were prepared from high-resolution Indian remote sensing satellite data (Cartosat-1 and Resourcesat-1) and were validated by field investigation. Several combinations of parameters were carried out using WofE modelling, and finally using best combination of eight parameters, 76.5 % of overall landslides were predicted in 24 % of the total area susceptible to landslide occurrences. The study has highlighted that using such methodology landslide susceptibility assessment can be carried out in vast stretches of Himalaya in short time in order to assess the impact of development as well as climate change/variability. The resultant map can play a critical role in selecting areas for remedial measures for slope stabilisation as well planning for future development of the region.","[Guri, Pardeep Kumar; Patel, Ramesh Chandra] Kurukshetra Univ, Dept Geophys, Kurukshetra 136119, Haryana, India; [Ray, P.

Phenology is one of the tools that may indicate changing patterns. The paper focuses on the phenological pattern of alpine/sub-alpine species Aconitum heterophyllum, a high-value medicinal herb of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), a global hotspot and known to be sensitive to climatic change. In all 117 herbarium specimens of the species collected from three provinces (Western Himalaya, North West Himalaya and Trans Himalaya) of the region were recorded. Historic herbarium records (1848-2003) were analyzed to predict the flowering patterns using Generalized Additive Model (GAM) in view of complexity in the herbarium-based data structure. GAM indicated that the flowering time responded significantly, 26 days earlier per 1,000 m (P < 0.02). Likewise, the model showed significantly earlier flowering (17-25 days) during the last 100 years (P < 0.01). Moreover, maximum temperature of winter (December-February) explained increasing trends at both elevations (lower and mid) and mean winter temperature influenced the early flowering time (19-27 days) with an increase of 1A degrees C. The overall early flowering of A. heterophyllum may perhaps be considered as indicator of climate change; however, more datasets of herbarium records are required to further strengthen this premise. This study was undertaken to show that herbarium records could be utilized as a potential resource for assessing climate change using GAM.","[Gaira, Kailash S.] GB Pant Inst Himalayan Environm & Dev, Sikkim Unit, Gangtok 737101, Sikkim, India; [Dhar, Uppeandra] Hamdard Univ Jamia Hamdard, Dept Bot, New Delhi 110062, India; [Belwal, O.

Many perennial rivers originate from Nepal Himalaya, located in the central part of the Himalayan region. Snowmelt water is essential freshwater for living, whereas it poses flood disaster potential, which is a major challenge for sustainable development. Climate change also largely affects snowmelt hydrology. Therefore, river discharge measurement requires crucial attention in the face of climate change, particularly in the Himalayan region. The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) is a frequently used method to measure river discharge in snow-fed mountain river basins. This study attempts to investigate snowmelt contribution in the overall discharge of the Budhi Gandaki River Basin (BGRB) using satellite remote sensing data products through the application of the SRM model. The model outputs were validated based on station measured river discharge data. The results show that SRM performed well in the study basin with a coefficient of determination (R-2) >0.880. Moreover, this study found that the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) meteorological datasets are highly applicable to the SRM in the Himalayan region. The study also shows that snow days have slightly decreased in the last three years, hence snowmelt contribution in overall discharge has decreased slightly in the study area. Finally, this study concludes that MOD10A2 and ECMWF precipitation and two-meter temperature products are highly applicable to measure snowmelt and associated discharge through SRM in the BGRB. Moreover, it also helps with proper freshwater planning, efficient use of winter water flow, and mitigating and preventive measures for the flood disaster.","[Pangali Sharma, Til Prasad; Zhang, Jiahua; Prodhan, Foyez Ahmed; Shi, Lamei] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst AIR, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Pangali Sharma, Til Prasad; Zhang, Jiahua; Prodhan, Foyez Ahmed; Shi, Lamei; Nepal, Nirdesh] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Khanal, Narendra Raj] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Geog, Kathmandu 66613, Nepal; [Prodhan, Foyez Ahmed] Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Agr Univ, Gazipur 1706, Bangladesh; [Paudel, Basanta] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Land Surface Proc, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, JH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst AIR, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.;Zhang, JH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",tilsharma@radi.ac.cn; zhangjh@radi.ac.cn; nrkhanal.geog@gmail.com; foyez@bsmrau.edu.bd; paudelb@igsnrr.ac.cn; shilm@radi.ac.cn; nepaln@imde.ac.cn,,,,,,,,14.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2020,12.0,12,,,,,,,1951,10.3390/rs12121951,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12121951,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000550370200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They allow hot-spots to be identified, and serve as input for the prioritization and design of adaptation actions. Over recent years, at the level of international climate science and policy, there has been a shift in the conceptualization of vulnerability toward emergence of 'climate risk' as a central concept. Despite this shift, few studies have operationalized these latest concepts to deliver assessment results at local, national, or regional scales, and clarity is lacking. Drawing from a pilot study conducted in the Indian Himalayas we demonstrate how core components of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure have been integrated to assess flood risk at two different scales, and critically discuss how these results have fed into adaptation planning. Firstly, within a state-wide assessment of glacial lake outburst flood risk, proxy indicators of exposure and vulnerability were combined with worst-case scenario modelling of the outburst hazard. At this scale, first-order assessment results are coarse, but have guided the design of monitoring strategies and other low-regret adaptation actions. Secondly, an assessment of seasonal monsoon and cloudburst-related flood risk was undertaken for individual mapped elements exposed along the main river valleys of Kullu district, drawing on innovative techniques using dendrogeomorphology to reconstruct potential flood magnitudes. Results at this scale have allowed specific adaptation strategies to be targeted towards hot-spots of risk. A comprehensive risk assessment must integrate across disciplines of physical and social science, to provide the necessary robust foundation for adaptation planning.","[Allen, S.

Results provide insights into climate change, scientific gaps, and their causes in deciphering meteorological observations from the last century to recent decades and envisage impacts of climate change on water reservoirs in the future. Warming trend of air temperature, in contrast to global temperature, has been projected in recent decades (after 1990) with a greater warming rate in the maximum temperature than the minimum temperature. This drifting of air temperature from the beginning of last century accelerates the diurnal temperature range of the Himalayas. An elevation-dependent warming trend is mostly perceived in the northwest Himalayan region, implicating an increased warming rate in the Greater Himalaya as compared to the lower and Karakoram Himalaya. No definite trends of precipitation have been observed over different regions of the IHR, suggesting heterogeneous cryosphere-climate interaction between western and central Himalaya.

Lilium polyphyllum D.Don ex Royle is a species indigenous to the coniferous forests of the Western Himalaya. However, over exploitation, due to its high medicinal properties and demands of industry, has resulted in a steep decline of its natural habitats. Consequently, the species is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. The present study was carried out in the Western Himalayan region using the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to predict the potential distribution of L. polyphyllum in respect of IPCC future climatic scenarios.

Future scenarios include IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6 and 8.5 (representing less harmful and harsh climatic conditions) for the years 2050 and 2070. The main predictor variables contributing to the habitat are the precipitation of the driest month (52.7%), elevation (13.9%) and temperature seasonality (7.8%). Current potential habitats for L. polyphyllum have been located in the north-west and south-east regions of the Western Himalaya. Future climate change scenarios predict that the potential habitats of this species will shrink by 38-81% in these regions and moreover the habitats will shift towards the south-east, making Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand state of India as favourable habitats in the future.

The knowledge of local people and farming communities for rural landscape management and sustainable use of bioresources is gaining credence as a key strategy to cope up with the climate change. Therefore, the present study analyzes the indigenous knowledge of local people and their perceptions on climate change, and also documented adaptation approaches at local level in mountain ecosystem of western Himalaya. The study could be useful to policy makers to design appropriate adaptation strategies to cope up with the impacts of climate change.","[Negi, Vikram S.; Pharswan, Dalbeer; Thakur, Shinny; Dhyani, Pitamber P.] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Almora, Uttarakhand, India; [Maikhuri, Rakesh K.] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Garhwal, Uttarakhand, India",,"Negi, VS (corresponding author), GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Almora, Uttarakhand, India.",vikramsnegii@gmail.com; rkmaikhuri@rediffmail.com; dalbeerp3@gmail.com; shinnythakur@gmail.com; ppdhyani@gbpihed.nic.in,,,,,,,,57.0,60.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2017,14.0,2,,,,,403,416,,10.1007/s11629-015-3814-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-015-3814-1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000394156900015,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the contribution of these two key factors on varying spatio-temporal scales in Himalayan landscapes still lacks in profound analyses. The present study takes Dharamsala and Pithoragarh urban landscapes as examples and uses the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) as the image fusion technique to generate highly resolved, both spatially (30 m) and temporally (monthly), NDVI images. These are used as inputs for Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model for Net Primary Productivity (NPP) estimation over the past two decades (2000-2020). During the study period, the NPP loss due to urbanization was 2065.43 kg C in Dharamsala and 401.07 kg C in Pithoragarh. Climate change, measured in terms of interseasonal changes in temperature, rainfall and solar radiation, had considerably contributed to the NPP variations of vegetated areas in both the study sites, however its contribution ratio was relatively lower than residual factors. There was a significant distribution gradient between how and where urban expansion and climate change influenced the NPP. Urban expansion impacts NPP more in plain areas corresponding to new urban land developments while climate change impacts NPP in high elevation mountainous regions dominated by Oak species. The observed declining trend of NPP under the current threat of urban expansion and climate change in the Himalaya highlights and invites the need of attributing importance to ecological issues. The findings of our study encompassing complex Himalayan landscapes could offer scientific perspectives for the management of ecological environment of highly fragile and vulnerable landscapes of the Himalaya.","[Sharma, Sonali; Joshi, P.

The Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) is a typical monsoonal marine glacier area that is extremely vulnerable to climate change. It is affected by both humid and warm Indian Ocean currents. Outlines of glaciers and glacial lakes in SETP have been extracted from Landsat satellite images with an automatic extraction method based on image compositing with Google Earth Engine and Random Forest algorithm. Alongside the outlines, meteorological data have been collected from 1990 to 2021. The results show that since 1990 the glacier area of SETP has retreated by about 2165.33 km(2) (similar to 25.28%), the glacial lake area has increased by about 36.41 km(2) (similar to 21.45%), and their number has increased by 477 (similar to 27.32%). The reliability and scientific validity of this study is proven by comparison with existing glacier inventories. By analyzing the meteorological data, the inverse correlation between the glacier area and temperature has been found. Despite decreases in cumulative precipitation, the glacial lake level rise and consequent area expansion have been observed.

This paper presents the findings of a study on the distribution of, and area changes in, glacial lakes in the Koshi basin in the central Himalayas. Data on the number of glacial lakes and their area was generated for the years 1977, 1990, 2000, and 2010 using Landsat satellite images. According to the glacial lake inventory in 2010, there were a total of 2168 glacial lakes with a total area of 127.61 km(2) and average size of 0.06 km(2) in the Koshi basin. Of these, 47% were moraine dammed lakes, 34.8% bedrock dammed lakes and 17.7% ice dammed lakes. The number of glacial lakes increased consistently over the study period from 1160 in 1977 to 2168 in 2010, an overall growth rate of 86.9%. The area of glacial lakes also increased from 94.44 km(2) in 1977 to 127.61 km(2) in 2010, a growth rate of 35.1%. A large number of glacial lakes in the inventory are small in size (<= 0.1 km(2)). End moraine dammed lakes with area greater than 0.1 km(2) were selected to analyze the change characteristics of glacial lakes in the basin. The results show that, in 2010, there were 129 lakes greater than 0.1 km(2) in area; these lakes had a total area of 42.92 km(2) in 1997, increasing to 63.28 km(2) in 2010.

Rhizocarpon geographicum (map lichen), a crustose lichen, grows in high mountain ranges, is a potential indicator species of climate change. In the present study, MaxEnt species distribution modeling algorithm was used to predict the suitable habitat for R. geographicum in current and future climate scenarios. Nineteen bioclimatic variables from WorldClim database, along with elevation, were used to predict the current distribution and three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios by integrating three general circulation models (GCMs) for future distribution of species covering years 2050 and 2070. Furthermore, we performed change analysis to identify the precise difference between the current and future distribution of suitable areas of the species for delineating habitat range expansion (gain), habitat contraction (loss), and stable habitats. The final ensemble model obtained had average test value 0.968, and its predicted similar to 27.5% of the geographical area in the Indian Himalayan Region is presently climatically suitable for the species. The predicted highly suitable area for R. geographicum is observed to be declining in Northwestern Himalaya, and it is shifting towards the higher elevation areas of the Eastern Himalaya. The projected distribution in future under the RCP scenarios (RCP 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) showed the range expansion towards higher elevations, and it is more pronounced for the extreme future scenarios (RCP 8.5) than for the moderate and intermediate climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0). However, assuming that species can migrate to previously unoccupied areas, the model forecasts a habitat loss of 10.86-16.51% for R. geographicum, which is expected due to increase in mean annual temperature by 1.5-3.7 degrees C. The predictive MaxEnt modeling approach for mapping lichen will contribute significantly to the understanding of the impact of climate change in Himalayan ecosystems with wide implications for drawing suitable conservation plans and to take adaptation and mitigation measures.","[Kumar, Devendra; Pandey, Aseesh; Rawat, Sandeep; Joshi, Mayank] Sikkim Reg Ctr, GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm NIHE, Gangtok, Sikkim, India; [Bajpai, Rajesh; Upreti, Dalip Kumar] Natl Bot Res Inst, CSIR, Lichenol Lab, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Surendra Pratap] Cent Himalayan Environm Assoc CHEA, 06 Waldorf Compound, Naini Tal 263001, Uttarakhand, India",,"Kumar, D (corresponding author), Sikkim Reg Ctr, GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm NIHE, Gangtok, Sikkim, India.",devendrawii@gmail.com; draseeshpandey@gmail.com; sandeep_rawat15@rediffmail.com; mayank.geo@gmail.com; bajpaienviro@gmail.com; upretidknbri@gmail.com; spsecology@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,29.0,41,,,SI,,61579,61593,,10.1007/s11356-021-15624-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15624-5,,AUG 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000681576600016,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite being prone to multiple hazards, the Himalayan Region has a scarcity of multi-faceted hazard studies. In this backdrop, present study aims to develop a multi-hazard susceptibility map for the Kargil-Ladakh Region of Trans-Himalayas using a standard three-step procedure which includes (i) hazard identification and inventorying; (ii) selection of conditioning factors; (iii) generation of individual and multi-hazard susceptibility maps. The identification and profiling of three major hazards namely, flash floods, landslides and snow avalanches, were followed by inventorying of individual hazards. Geo-spatial tools and frequency ratio (FR) method were used to generate individual and multi-hazard susceptibility maps by selecting a set of conditioning factors and combining them with the hazard inventories. The results reveal that in single-hazard scenario, landslide susceptibility is highest at 44%, while as combined susceptibility for landslide and snow avalanche in double-hazard scenario was found to be 58%. In triple-hazard scenario involving landslide, snow avalanche and flash flood, combined susceptibility was around 39% for the region. The validation of results using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) depicts an area under curve (AUC) values of 83%, 81% and 71% for snow avalanches, landslides, and flash floods, respectively, which lies within acceptable limits. The findings also indicate that agriculture, built-up and infrastructure developments are expanding within the high hazard-susceptible zones, emphasizing a need for implementation of disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies in this multi-hazard prone Trans-Himalayan Kargil region.","[Akbar, Mohmad; Bhat, M.

The significance of this study is that it would be the first instance when the 'geon' model will be attempted to delineate landslide susceptibility map (LSM) for the complex lesser Himalayan topography as a contemporary LSM technique. This study adopted the per-pixel-based ensemble approaches through modified frequency ratio (MFR) and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and compared it with the 'geons' (object-based) aggregation method to produce an LSM for the lesser Himalayan Kalsi-Chakrata road corridor. For the landslide susceptibility models, 14 landslide conditioning factors were carefully chosen; namely, slope, slope aspect, elevation, lithology, rainfall, seismicity, normalized differential vegetation index, stream power index, land use/land cover, soil, topographical wetness index, and proximity to drainage, road, and fault. The inventory data for the past landslides were derived from preceding satellite images, intensive field surveys, and validation surveys. These inventory data were divided into training and test datasets following the commonly accepted 70:30 ratio. The GIS-based statistical techniques were adopted to establish the correlation between landslide training sites and conditioning factors. To determine the accuracy of the model output, the LSMs accuracy was validated through statistical methods of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and relative landslide density index (R-index). The accuracy results indicate that the object-based geon methods produced higher accuracy (geon FAHP: 0.934; geon MFR: 0.910) over the per-pixel approaches (FAHP: 0.887; MFR: 0.841). The results noticeably showed that the geon method constructs significant regional units for future mitigation strategies and development.

Apart from temperature, variation in non-climatic factors, such as livestock grazing, and topography contribute considerably to the wide elevation range in TLE. Rhododendron, Juniperus, Abies, and Betula are common Himalayan treeline genera. Treeline elevation (3200-4900m) and it increases (i) from NW to SE (18.4m 1 degrees(-1) longitude), (ii) from periphery (from both north and south sides) to central part of the ranges, and (iii) from north to south aspect. A shift in dominance from deciduous Betula utilis (birch) to evergreen rhododendrons is discernible from the NW to SE. Treelines in the Himalayas differ between south and north aspects in species, elevation and anthropogenic activities, such as pastoralism. Response of treeline species to climate change could vary considerably, depending upon whether warmer temperatures of pre-monsoon months are accompanied by increased precipitation of the intensify droughts. Biomass accumulation rate declines rapidly towards treelines, and its role in treeline formation needs detailed investigations. An ecosystem approach is required to improve our understanding and management of Himalayan treeline areas.","[Singh, S.

This phenomenon is exacerbated by a confluence of factors, including extreme precipitation events, undulating topographical features, and suboptimal soil and water conservation practices. Over the past few decades, several flash flood events have led to the significant degradation of pedosphere strata, which in turn has caused landslides along with fluvial sedimentation in the IHR. Researchers have advocated morphometric, hydrologic, and semi-empirical methods for assessing flash flood-induced soil erosion in hilly watersheds. This study critically examines these methods and their applicability in the Alaknanda River basin of the Indian Himalayan Region. The entire basin is delineated into 12 sub-watersheds, and 13 morphometric parameters are analyzed for each sub-watershed. Thereafter, the ranking of sub-watersheds vulnerability is assigned using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), compounding method (CM), Geomorphological Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (GIUH), and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equations (RUSLE) approaches. While the CM method uses all 13 parameters, the PCA approach suggests that the first four principal components are the most important ones, accounting for approximately 89.7% of the total variance observed within the dataset. The GIUH approach highlights the hydrological response of the catchment, incorporating dynamic velocity and instantaneous peak magnifying the flash flood susceptibility, lag time, and the time to peak for each sub-watershed. The RUSLE approach incorporates mathematical equations for estimating annual soil loss utilizing rainfall-runoff erosivity, soil erodibility, topographic, cover management, and supporting practice factors. The variations in vulnerability rankings across various methods indicate that each method captures distinct aspects of the sub-watersheds. The decision-maker can use the weighted average to assign the overall vulnerability to each sub-watershed, aggregating the values from various methods. This study considers an equal weight to the morphometric, hydrological GIUH, and semi-empirical RUSLE techniques to assess the integrated ranking of various sub-watersheds. Vulnerability to flash flood-induced landslides in various sub-watersheds is categorized into three classes. Category I (high-priority) necessitates immediate erosion control measures and slope stabilization. Category II (moderate attention), where rainwater harvesting and sustainable agricultural practices are beneficial. Category III (regular monitoring) suggests periodic community-led soil assessments and afforestation. Sub-watersheds WS11, WS8, WS5, and WS12 are identified under category I, WS7, WS4, WS9, and WS6 under category II, and WS1, WS3, WS2, and WS10 under category III. The occurrence of landslides and flash-flood events and field observations validates the prioritization of sub-watersheds, indicating the need for targeted interventions and regular monitoring activities to mitigate environmental risks and safeguard surrounding ecosystems and communities.","[Singh, Sachchidanand; Kansal, Mitthan Lal] Indian Inst Technol, Water Resources Dev & Management, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India; [Singh, Sachchidanand] Natl Inst Hydrol, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India",,"Kansal, ML (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Water Resources Dev & Management, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India.",mlk@wr.iitr.ac.in,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,2023 NOV 3,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11356-023-30613-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-30613-6,,NOV 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001098655600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Three indices, namely (i) earthquake hazard index, (ii) liquefaction susceptibility index and (iii) landslide susceptibility index were estimated for comprehensive seismic hazard zonation mapping in this area. The earthquake hazard index was estimated by integration of data such as lithology, faults, soil, landforms, Gutenberg-Richter parameter (b value), predominant frequency, amplification factor and peak horizontal acceleration using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. Similarly, geology and topographic parameters were integrated using the AHP method to estimate the Liquefaction Susceptibility Index. A multivariate statistical technique was used to estimate the Landslide Susceptibility Index. The three indices were combined to prepare mesoscale seismic hazard zonation map of the area which was classified into low, moderate, and high seismic hazard zones. Validation of the mesoscale seismic hazard zonation map was done using the isoseismal data of past earthquakes. High seismic hazard zones are found in the foothills and Siwalik region of the Himalaya, which consist of alluvial sand and unconsolidated sediments, whereas moderate zones are identified partially in the foothills, Siwalik and the Lesser Himalaya. This map will be useful for earthquake hazard mitigation in the NW Himalaya.","[Pudi, Ramesh; Martha, Tapas R.; Roy, Priyom; Kumar, K.

This gravel-sand transition is characterized by an abrupt greater-than-one-order-of-magnitude drop in both gradient and sediment grain size, suggesting a degree of long-term stability. However, the stratigraphic record of the gravel-sand transition in the Miocene Siwalik Group demonstrates intermittent transport of coarse gravels tens of kilometres downstream of the transition; such events in contemporary channels would drive channel avulsion(s) and increase flood risk, devastating communities across the plains. We combine sedimentological analysis of Siwalik deposits with entrainment calculations which demonstrate that hyperconcentration is required to transport coarse bedload over low-gradient plains. Transport conditions are attainable when intense monsoon precipitation (a 200- to 1000-year event) is combined with increased suspended sediment concentrations in channels.

Because of steep mountain slopes, and dynamic geological conditions, large-scale landslides are very common in Lesser and Higher Himalayan zones of Nepal Himalaya. Slopes along the major highways of central Nepal namely Prithvi Highway, Narayangadh-Mugling Road and Tribhuvan Highway are considered in this study of large-scale landslides. Geologically, the highways in consideration pass through crushed and jointed Kathmandu Nappe affected by numerous faults and folds. The relict large-scale landslides have been contributing to debris flows and slides along the highways. Most of the slope failures are mainly bechanced in geological formations consisting phyllite, schist and gneiss. Laboratory test on the soil samples collected from the failure zones and field investigation suggested significant hydrothermal alteration in the area. The substantial hydrothermal alteration in the Lesser Himalaya during advancement of the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and thereby clay mineralization in sliding zones of large-scale landslide are the main causes of large-scale landslides in the highways of central Nepal. This research also suggests that large-scale landslides are the major cause of slope failure during monsoon in the Lesser Himalaya of Nepal. Similarly, hydrothermal alteration is also significant in failure zone of the large-scale landslides.

Our paper, utilizing the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs-2050), the future global warming climatic scenarios, explores the trend of range shifts of Himalayan pheasants in the Eastern Himalayas based on an ensemble technique. The prediction model demonstrated that the core zone habitat of the Himalayan pheasants would have shifted towards higher altitude and latitude gradients with the greenhouse gaseous intensification. Under the extreme future climatic scenario, the species may reach towards Sky Island of the Himalayan regions. Therefore, a legitimate policy is essential to implement on time for the mitigation of the greenhouse gaseous emission. The outcome of this article illuminated that the present protected areas (PAs) of the Eastern Himalayas appeared to be inadequate regarding conservation measures of Himalayan Pheasants due to the current range may go rapidly beyond the protected zones.

As a result, the Himalayas, Naga Hills, Shillong-Karbi Massifs, and the Assam Valley have many crustal-scale active faults. These faults often cause moderate to large earthquakes while releasing the accumulated stress associated with Plate tectonics. In this study, one such major earthquake event of Mw 6.0 occurred near the Kopili Fault and Himalayan Frontal Thrust in the eastern Himalayan foreland region on 28th April 2021. The event has been investigated to understand its seismotectonic and environmental impacts. The quake caused much damage in the epicentral area around Dhekiyajuli of Sonitpur District, Assam, India. The densely populated Guwahati and Tezpur cities of Assam have suffered damage as some parts of buildings and roads were collapsed. Moreover, a landslide near Bhairabkunda and several liquefaction incidents near Tezpur and Dhekiyajuli localities were also recorded, within 30-50 km from the epicentre. It is found from NASA's GRACE-Land data that the increase in groundwater volume on the northern bank of the Brahmaputra than the previous year might be related to higher rainfall in the recharge zone around the Himalayan Frontal parts. Such groundwater conditions caused saturation of the subsurface soil and alluvium, which resulted in the formation of liquefaction during high shaking. These incidents also caused severe environmental damage. After the earthquake, the sprouting of mud water affected rice fields and nearby freshwater sources like ponds and lakes. This earthquake, along with the historical ones, reveals the vulnerability of the entire region to many natural hazards.

In these montane systems, the effects of environmental changes on tree growth are also modified by elevation itself, thus complicating our ability to predict effects of future climate change.

Here, we study long-term physiological (ratio of internal to ambient CO2, i.e., C-i/C-a and intrinsic water-use efficiency, iWUE) and growth responses (tree-ring width) of Himalayan fir (Abies spectabilis) trees in response to warming, drying, and CO2 rise. Our study was conducted along elevational gradients in a dry and a wet region in the central Himalaya. We combined dendrochronology and stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) to quantify long-term trends in C-i/C-a ratio and iWUE (delta C-13-derived), growth (mixed-effects models), and evaluate climate sensitivity (correlations). We found that iWUE increased over time at all elevations, with stronger increase in the dry region. Climate-growth relations showed growth-limiting effects of spring moisture (dry region) and summer temperature (wet region), and negative effects of temperature (dry region). We found negative growth trends at lower elevations (dry and wet regions), suggesting that continental-scale warming and regional drying reduced tree growth. This interpretation is supported by delta C-13-derived long-term physiological responses, which are consistent with responses to reduced moisture and increased vapor pressure deficit. At high elevations (wet region), we found positive growth trends, suggesting that warming has favored tree growth in regions where temperature most strongly limits growth. At lower elevations (dry and wet regions), the positive effects of CO2 rise did not mitigate the negative effects of warming and drying on tree growth.

Among all types, Karst aquifers were found to be highly vulnerable. The changes in the forest and urban landscapes are affecting the recharging sites in the headwater region. In the Central Himalayan region (Kosi River basin, Kumaun), the number of perennial springs is decreasing at a rate of three springs year(-1), and non-perennial springs are increasing at the rate of one spring year(-1). The high concentration of NO3-, Cl-1, SO42-, and coliform counts reported from the spring water evidence a high susceptibility of shallow aquifers to the non-point source of pollution. Future projections indicate high surface-runoff and occurrence of extreme events such as floods, glacial lake outbursts, and landslides can affect the flow and water quality of springs. As the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities are expected to increase with time remarkably, there is an urgent need to promote regional scientific studies on springs targeting hydrogeochemical evolution, vulnerability assessment, recharge area dynamics, and development of springshed management program.","[Panwar, Sugandha] Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China; [Panwar, Sugandha] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Panwar, S (corresponding author), Tongji Univ, State Key Lab Marine Geol, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R China.;Panwar, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sugandha.panwar@tongji.edu.cn,,,,,,,,21.0,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2020,17.0,1,,,,,117,132,,10.1007/s11629-018-5308-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-018-5308-4,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000512076900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Heavy rainfall, steep slope and developmental activities are important factors for the occurrence of landslides in the district. Therefore, specific assessment of landslide susceptibility and its accuracy at regional level is essential for disaster management and proper land use planning. The article evaluates effectiveness of frequency ratio, fuzzy logic and logistic regression models for assessing landslide susceptibility in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand state, India. A landslide inventory map was prepared and verified by field data. Fourteen landslide parameters and generated inventory map were utilized to prepare landslide susceptibility maps through frequency ratio, fuzzy logic and logistic regression models. Landslide susceptibility maps generated through these models were classified into very high, high, medium, low and very low categories using natural breaks classification. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, spatially agreed area approach and seed cell area index (SCAI) method were used to validate the landslide models. Validation results revealed that fuzzy logic model was found to be more effective in assessing landslide susceptibility in the study area. The landslide susceptibility map generated through fuzzy logic model can be best utilized for landslide disaster management and effective land use planning.","[Sahana, Mehebub; Sajjad, Haroon] Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Geog, Fac Nat Sci, New Delhi, India",,"Sajjad, H (corresponding author), Jamia Millia Islamia, Dept Geog, Fac Nat Sci, New Delhi, India.",mehebubsahana@gmail.com; haroon.geog@gmail.com,,,,,,,,47.0,49.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2017,14.0,11,,,,,2150,2167,,10.1007/s11629-017-4404-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-017-4404-1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000415351800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Often, these events are followed by the triggering of secondary hazards (like landslide dams, debris flows, and flooding), thereby posing massive risks to infrastructure and residents in the region. This study was taken up to understand the dynamics of an extraordinary debris flood disaster in the Rishiganga River valley, Chamoli district of Uttarakhand on 7th February 2021. Rapid mass movements (RAMMS)-debris flow software was employed to recreate the entire sequence of the hazard consisting of a rock-ice slide, mass deposition and erosion along the channel, and subsequent debris flood. Forty-nine scenarios were analyzed for accurate calibration of dry-Coulomb type friction coefficient (mu) and viscous-turbulent friction coefficient (xi). Consequently, the geomorphologic characteristics of the debris flow were validated using high-resolution satellite image interpretation and field photographs. The volume of detached rock-ice mass was estimated to be 26.42 x10(6) m(3). At the same time, the RAMMS-derived model outputs for velocity, flow depth, and momentum were found in good agreement with the extent and height of actual debris on the ground. The study highlights an urgent need to identify the glaciers with a high risk of ice avalanches in the Indian Himalayas. The presented modeling approach may be applied in dynamic mountain ecosystems to simulate potential flash floods due to avalanches. Moreover, the information reported in this study can be vital input for improving the district-level disaster management plan.","[Singh, Gagandeep; Rawat, Manish; Pandey, Ashish] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Water Resources Dev & Management, Roorkee 247667, Uttaranchal, India",,"Singh, G (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Water Resources Dev & Management, Roorkee 247667, Uttaranchal, India.",gsingh@wr.iitr.ac.in,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2023,195.0,9,,,,,,,1118,10.1007/s10661-023-11774-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11774-w,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001058762800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main drawback in understanding climate change in the remote Himalayan ecosystems is the lack of long-term instrumental climate records. Reconstructing past climates from tree-rings offers a useful proxy for adding data to the instrumental climate records. In this study, climatically sensitive tree-rings of Himalayan fir (Abies pindrow) were used for reconstruction of mean June-July temperatures of Kashmir valley. Total ring-width chronology was built from 60 tree-ring cores growing near the higher altitudinal limits of the species. The radial growth showed a strong positive response to growing season temperature. The strong response of site chronology to mean June-July temperatures was used for reconstruction purposes. Mean June-July temperatures of Kashmir valley were reconstructed since 1773 from residual site chronology. Though the reconstruction did not show any strong long-term trend, on a centennial-scale, 20th-century summers were the warmest with a mean annual summer temperature of 22.99 degrees C. Seven of the warmest years and five of the warmest decades were seen in the 20th century. The reconstruction for 1773-2012 showed 23 extreme hot summers above the hot threshold of a 23.47 degrees C mean temperature and 19 extreme cold years below the cold threshold of a 22.46 degrees C mean summer temperature. The cold years in the reconstruction did not coincide with known volcanic eruptions. This reconstruction will help in providing a better understanding of regional climate change.","[Malik, Rayees; Sukumar, Raman] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India; [Sukumar, Raman] Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India",,"Malik, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",rayeesmalik@iisc.ac.in; rsuku@iisc.ac.in,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2021,12.0,3,,,,,,,410,10.3390/atmos12030410,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12030410,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000633296000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study provides an overview of the glacier mass balance records by glaciological, geodetic, hydrological and accumulation-area ratio (AAR) and specific mass balance relationship methods in the Indian Himalaya since 1970s. It suggests that the mass balance measurements by glaciological methods have been conducted for ten glaciers in the western Himalaya, four glaciers in the central Himalaya and one in the eastern Himalaya. Hydrological mass balance has been conducted only on Siachen Glacier from 1987 to 1991. Geodetic method has been attempted for the Lahaul-Spiti region for a short time span during 1999-2011 and Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya region from 2003 to 2008. We compared in situ specific balance data series with specific mass balance derived from AAR and specific mass balance relationship. The results derived from existing and newly presented regression model based on AAR and specific mass balance relationship induced unrealistic specific mass balance for several glaciers. We also revised AAR0 and ELA0 based on available in situ AAR and specific mass balance data series of Indian Himalayan glaciers. In general, in situ specific and cumulative specific mass balance observed over different regions of the Indian Himalayan glaciers shows mostly negative mass balance years with a few positive ones during 1974-2012. On a regional level, the geodetic studies suggest that on the whole western, the central and the eastern Himalaya experienced vast thinning during the last decade (2000s). Conversely, Karakoram region showed slight mass gain during almost similar period. However, the glaciological, hydrological and geodetic mass balance data appear to exhibit short time series bias. We therefore recommend creation of benchmark glaciers network for future research to determine the impact of climate change on the Himalayan cryosphere.","[Pratap, Bhanu; Dobhal, Dwarika Prasad; Bhambri, Rakesh; Mehta, Manish] Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Ctr Glaciol, 33-GMS Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Tewari, Vinod Chandra] Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, 33-GMS Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Pratap, B (corresponding author), Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Ctr Glaciol, 33-GMS Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",bhanuglacio@gmail.com; dpdobhal@wihg.res.in; rakeshbhambri@gmail.com; msmehta75@gmail.com; vtewari@wihg.res.in,,,,,,,,75.0,76.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2016,16.0,3,,,SI,,643,658,,10.1007/s10113-015-0791-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-015-0791-4,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000370178000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

It was accompanied by a ground rupture of about 75 km with an average slip of about 5 m along the causative fault. The epicenter of the thrust was located at about 19 km to the NE of its surface trace in Muzaffarabad with about 11 km depth of the hypocenter. The geometry of the fault based on a structural cross section has allowed us to interpret it as a thrust restricted to a roof sequence along a triangle zone across the Hazara-Kashmir syntaxis (HKS). The triangle zone is occupied at depth by a wedge of the Higher Himalayan Sequence (HHS) in the core zone of the HKS. The core-wedge is bounded between the NE-dipping BBF and SE- to SW-dipping thrust stack of the Lesser Himalayan Sequence (LHS) along the northeastern and southwestern limb of the HKS, respectively. Based on surface geology, the overlapping BBF and MBT are interpreted to merge at depth in a roof thrust of Pre-Cambrian (Late Proterozoic) rocks above a duplex which is inferred to have a floor thrust in Early Proterozoic/Archean rocks. The core-wedge is located over a ramp which is connected to the floor thrust in the basement. The BBF is inferred to be active, at least since 1-0.5 Ma, with recurrence interval of about 625 +/- A 125 years. This out-of-sequence deformation is represented by linear seismicity, both along emergent and blind thrusts in the system, with likelihood of major events as a result of strain buildup due to slow convergence rates (7 mm/year) in the region. Many towns located along the active fault trace were destroyed or largely damaged due to the earthquake. Major destruction of human dwellings and infrastructure occurred as a consequence of earthquake-triggered landslides, mostly along fault, high river terraces, and road cuts. To minimize future damages in earthquake-prone areas, several mitigation measures are suggested including: (1) avoiding new settlements near the fault trace and landslide susceptible areas, (2) establishment of new township schemes in relatively safer areas with earthquake-sustainable structural designs, and (3) extensive forestation for slope stability, erosion control, and provision of wood for flexible earthquake-resistant structures. The measures are needed for the sustainable development of the region.","[Jadoon, Ishtiaq A.

Gravitational stresses affect geologic processes and engineering operations in slopes. Considering this fact, a concept of topo-stress evaluation is developed in this research and used to produce a shallow landslide susceptibility map in a model area. The topo-stress introduced in this research refers to the shear stress induced by the gravitational forces on the planes parallel to the ground surface. Weight of the material on a slope and friction angle of the jointed rock mass are the two fundamental parameters that are considered to govern topo-stress in this study. Considering topo-stress as a main factor for initiating shallow landslides, a GIS-based probabilistic model is developed for shallow landslide susceptibility zonation. An ideal terrain in central Nepal is selected as the study area for this purpose. Two event-based shallow landslide inventories are used to predict accuracy of the model, which is found to be more than 78 % for the first event-landslides and more than 76 % for the second event-landslides.

Forest dependency was compared among villages surrounded by oak-dominated forests (n = 8) and pine-dominated forests (n = 9). Both quantitative and qualitative analyses indicate variations in the degree of dependency based on proximity to nearest forest type. Households near oak-dominated forests were more dependent on forests (83.8%) compared to households near pine-dominated forests (69.1%). Forest dependency is mainly subsistence-oriented for meeting basic household requirements. Livestock population, cultivated land per household, and non-usage of alternative fuels are the major explanatory drivers of forest dependency. Our findings can help decision and policy makers to establish nested governance mechanisms encouraging prioritized site-specific conservation options among forest-adjacent households.

Soil characteristics, low angle of internal friction of fines in soil, medium range of soil permeability, presence of clay minerals in soil, bedrock hydrogeology, and human intervention were found to be the main contributing parameters for slope failures in the region.","[Dahal, Ranjan Kumar; Hasegawa, Shuichi; Yamanaka, Minoru] Kagawa Univ, Dept Safety Syst Construct Engn, Fac Engn, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7610396, Japan; [Dahal, Ranjan Kumar] Tribhuvan Univ, Dept Geol, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Dhakal, Santosh] Dept Mines & Geol, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Bhandary, Netra Prakash; Yatabe, Ryuichi] Ehime Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan",,"Dahal, RK (corresponding author), Kagawa Univ, Dept Safety Syst Construct Engn, Fac Engn, 2217-20 Hayashi Cho, Takamatsu, Kagawa 7610396, Japan.",ranjan@ranjan.net.np,,,,,,,,41.0,51.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2009,58.0,3,,,,,567,586,,10.1007/s00254-008-1531-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-008-1531-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000267895600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

A fundamental question that is often overlooked is: which changes in climate will cause the redistribution or extinction of threatened species? Here, we mapped and modelled the current and future geographical distributions of the four threatened medicinal plants - Aconitum heterophyllum Wall. ex Royle, Fritillaria cirrhosa D.Don, Meconopsis aculeata Royle and Rheum webbianum Royle - in Kashmir Himalaya using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. Species occurrence records were collated from detailed field studies carried out between the years 2010 and 2020. Four general circulation models for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios were chosen for future range changes over periods around 2050 (average for 2041-2060) and 2070 (average of 2061-2080). Notable differences existed between species in their responses to predictive environmental variables of temperature and precipitation. Increase in the most suitable habitat, except for A. heterophyllum and R. webbianum, were evident across Himalayan Mountain regions, while the Pir Panjal mountain region exhibited a decrease for all four species under future climate change scenarios.

Various geomorphic indices such as longitudinal and topographic swath profile, stream length gradient index, steepness index, and valley floor width to valley height ratio have been extracted for interpreting the active tectonics of the region, and the topographic bedding plane intersection angle (TOBIA) index for the disposition of the bedding or foliation planes of the rocks with respect to the terrain. In addition, the active nature of the thrusts and faults in the region has been interpreted with the offsets or deflection of the river terraces along these thrusts and faults. Interrelationships among these indices and the spatial distribution of landslide indicate that the region between Dharchula and Dobaat is the most tectonically active region as indicated by the presence of Dharchula Fault, Lasku Fault and South Chhiplakot Thrust along with the abnormally high steepness index and knickpoints in the region. Other regions of active tectonics are Dhap-Kalika and Jauljibi-Baniyagaon regions due to Ghatibagarh Kalika Fault, and Berinag Thrust and Rauntis Fault, respectively.

Since the mid-twentieth century, rising temperatures have led to unsustainably high melting rates for many glaciers, particularly in the Himalaya, temporarily increasing summer meltwater run-off but continuously reducing the ice-storage volume. In this Review, we discuss how and why glaciers and meltwater supplies have changed, how they will likely evolve in the future and how these changes impact water resources and water-related hazards. Heterogeneous glacier retreat is changing streamflow patterns, in turn, affecting the incidence of glacial-lake outburst floods and exacerbating the risk of flooding and water shortages associated with future climate change. These changes could negatively impact downstream populations and infrastructure, including the thriving hydropower sector and some of the world's largest irrigated agriculture systems, by making water flow more extreme and unpredictable. An improved in situ monitoring network for weather, hydrology and glacier change is a crucial requirement for predicting the future of this resource and associated hazards, and their impact on regional water, energy and food security. Glaciers in the Himalaya and Karakoram mountain ranges provide freshwater and hydropower to millions of people but are also melting at unsustainably high rates. This Review discusses recent and projected changes in glacier melt and resulting implications for regional water-related hazards and water resources. Key pointsHimalayan glaciers have lost mass at an accelerating rate in recent decades, in contrast with relatively stable Karakoram glaciers.Under a range of climate change scenarios, the run-off of glacier meltwater in the Himalaya and Karakoram is likely to peak in the next few decades.After glacial run-off peaks, run-off will decline as the glaciers in both mountain ranges shrink, although the magnitude and timing of the peak and the rate of subsequent decline are uncertain.Basin run-off regimes will become more rain-dominated as the modulating effect of glaciers decreases, and this is likely to increase the impact of droughts and floods.The frequency of glacial-lake outburst floods and run-off floods have increased recently and could increase further in coming decades, threatening existing and planned hydropower infrastructure downstream.A lower-emissions climate change pathway would reduce the rate of glacier loss, increasing the time available for adaptation. This pathway would have considerable socio-economic benefits.","[Nie, Yong; Liu, Qiao; Chen, Xiaoqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Pritchard, Hamish D.] British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England; [Hennig, Thomas] Philipps Univ Marburg, Fac Geog, Marburg, Germany; [Wang, Wenling; Liu, Shiyin] Yunnan Univ, Inst Int Rivers & Ecosecur, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoming] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Nepal, Santosh; Samyn, Denis] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Hewitt, Kenneth] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON, Canada",,"Nie, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",nieyong@imde.ac.cn,,,,,,,,174.0,185.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,2.0,2,,,,,91,106,,10.1038/s43017-020-00124-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43017-020-00124-w,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000671874300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Araniko Highway is a major highway connecting Nepal and China that has suffered from several instability problems. Recent earthquake activity in Nepal has generated many landslides, including rock falls along the highway, mostly between Lamosangu and Liping. These landslides have deposited huge piles of debris along the highway, as well as in the hill slope above, which has increased future risk of rock fall. Here, we have tried to analyze the distribution of rock falls along the highway, their mode of failure, and the associated hazard and risk. The analysis shows that most of the rock falls are concentrated along steep rock cliffs and are mostly rock topples, with some wedge and plane failure type. For the rock fall hazard and risk assessment of the highway, we have slightly modified the original rock fall hazard and risk assessment method to fit the condition of the Araniko Highway. The developed hazard and risk map effectively indicates various levels of rock fall hazard and risk along the highway. Based on the level of hazard and risk, the maintenance and inspection work can be carried out.

Ecological niche based models are widely used to map habitat suitability of current and future potential distribution of species, using precise coordinates of species occurrences, along with climatic and various environmental variables. Despite the importance of high dependence on forest resources in the Himalayan region, the direct impacts of climate change on major forest tree species is not well-documented. In the present study, we used MaxEnt (or maximum entropy) modelling to predict current distribution and changes in the future distributions of four ecologically and economically dominant forest tree species (Quercus leucotrichophora, Q. semecarpifolia, Q. floribunda, and Pinus roxburghii) in the central Himalayan region. Future predictions were based on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for two time periods (2050s and 2070s). We demonstrated the use of MaxEnt by combining different climatic, geomorphologic, and pedologic variables as predictor variables to model the potential climatic niches. We evaluated the model performance with an average AUC value varying as 0.809 (+/- 0.020), 0.982 (+/- 0.008), 0.966 (+/- 0.006), and 0.803 (+/- 0.025) for Q leucotrichophora, Q semecarpifolia, Q floribunda and P. roxburghii, respectively. Depending upon the RCPs, the results show both increase and decrease in suitable habitat range of these species across all future climate scenarios. The shifts in geographic distributions of climatic niches show unusual patterns, implying the need for urgent adaptive forest management strategies. Our approach can be used as a baseline database for broad-scale applicability in forest tree species restoration and conservation planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This natural disaster annually leads to several fatalities, injuries, and property destruction. Monitoring landslides and promptly alerting people to looming disasters in light of these injuries and fatalities are crucial. To date, no efficient technique is in practice to predict landslides. The tools that are now available monitor landslides at a very high cost and do not offer early warning or forecasts of soil movement. An innovative, low-cost Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for landslip warning, monitoring, and prediction is the major objective of this research. Its assessment, implementation, and development are described in detail. This study proposes an IoT-based smart landslide detection, warning, prediction, and monitoring system. The pre and post-measures use sensors and other hardware to deal with landslide disasters. It uses real-time environment monitoring (landslide site) for any changes and provides appropriate output by comparing the threshold values. The proposed system is tested on a prototype model, which performed well in our tests. The database was updated 2.5 s after the landslide thanks to a steady Internet connection. In less than 5 s after the event, the Thingspeak channel can display a graphical depiction of the data and its position. Multiple readings showed an 80-85% system accuracy rate. Further, the proposed ensemble learning-based risk prediction model is applied to static and dynamic data to predict the landslide for future reference. The ensemble classifier model has 98.67% recall, 96.56% accuracy, 97.35% F1-value, and 96.07% precision.

Based on the evaluation of the frequency distribution of the landslide, the relationship between the landslide and the various contributing factors was determined. Then, the landslide susceptibility was calculated using logistic regression and statistical index methods along with different topographic (slope, aspect, relative relief, plan curvature, altitude, topographic wetness index) and non-topographic factors (distance from river, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance from road, precipitation, land use and land cover, and geology), and 470 (70%) of total 658 landslides. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using 198 (30%) of total landslides showed that the prediction curve rates (area under the curve, AUC) values for two methods (logistic regression and statistical index) were 0.826, and 0.823 with success rates of 0.793, and 0.811, respectively. The values of R-Index for the logistic regression and statistical index methods were 83.66 and 88.54, respectively, consisting of high susceptible hazard classes.

The magnitude of the significant precipitation trends was estimated through time series analysis at a 95% confidence interval. To assess the sensitivity of natural resources (forest, water and land) and human resources, fourteen mountain-specific indicators were identified which captured resource index using data standardization and principal component analysis. Sen's slope and Resource index were plotted in a 2D Cartesian coordinate to draw precipitation-resource quadrants with their effective coverage area: High Precipitation and Scarce Resources (35.92%); Low Precipitation and Abundant Resources (30.10%); Low Precipitation and Scarce Resources (22.33%) and High Precipitation and Abundant Resources (11.65%).

The scarcity of observations is one of the major challenges for understanding various land surface processes in the mountainous and mostly ungauged terrain. The study assesses the impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes between 1980 and 2020 and extreme rainfall on peak discharge and sediment yield in the Upper Jhelum Basin (UJB), Kashmir Himalaya, India using KINEROS2 model. Analysis of LULC change revealed a notable shift from natural LULC to more intensive human-modified LULC, including a decrease in vegetative cover, deforestation, urbanization, and improper farming practices. The findings revealed a strong influence of the LULC changes on peak discharge, and sediment yield relative to the 2014 timeframe, which coincided with the catastrophic September 2014 flood event. The model predicted a peak discharge of 115,101 cubic feet per second (cfs) and a sediment yield of 56.59 tons/ha during the September 2014 flooding, which is very close to the observed peak discharge of 115,218 cfs indicating that the model is reliable for discharge prediction. The model predicted a peak discharge of 98,965 cfs and a sediment yield of 49.11 tons/ha in 1980, which increased to 118,366 cfs and, 58.92 tons/ha, respectively, in 2020, showing an increase in basin's flood risk over time. In the future, it is anticipated that the ongoing LULC changes will make flood vulnerability worse, which could lead to another major flooding in the event of an extreme rainfall as predicted under climate change and, in turn, compromise achievement of sustainable development goals (SDG). Therefore, regulating LULC in order to modulate various hydrological and land surface processes would ensure stability of runoff and reduction in sediment yield in the UJB, which is critical for achieving many SDGs.","[Yousuf, Aazim; Romshoo, Shakil Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Geoinformat, Srinagar 190006, India",,"Romshoo, SA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Geoinformat, Srinagar 190006, India.",shakilrom@kashmiruniversity.ac.in,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,14.0,20,,,,,,,13602,10.3390/su142013602,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142013602,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000875960400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents comprehensive hazard mapping and risk assessments in the downstream region of the Karnali River basin for different return-period floods, with the aid of the HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System). The assessment was conducted on a 38 km segment of the Karnali River from Chisapani to the Nepal India border. To perform hydrodynamic simulations, a long-term time series of instantaneous peak discharge records from the Chisapani gauging station was collected. Flooding conditions representing 2-, 5-, 10-, 50-, 100-, 200-, and 1000-year return periods (YRPs) were determined using Gumbel's distribution. With an estimated peak discharge of up to 29,910 m(3)/s and the flood depths up to 23 m in the 1000-YRP, the area vulnerable to flooding in the study domain extends into regions on both the east and west banks of the Karnali River. Such flooding in agricultural land poses a high risk to food security, which directly impacts on residents' livelihoods. Furthermore, the simulated flood in 2014 (equivalent to a 100-YRP) showed a high level of impact on physical infrastructure, affecting 51 schools, 14 health facilities, 2 bus-stops, and an airport. A total of 132 km of rural urban roads and 22 km of highways were inundated during the flood.

An evaluation based on predicted scenarios of its growth trend under future climate change,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Global warming is likely to become one of the significant drivers of forest losses in the Hindu-Kush Himalaya (HKH) during the 21st century. Better understanding of how forest ecosystem will respond to global warming requires a pre-cise knowledge of site and species specific responses to climate change. We applied dendrochronological technique to quantify and predict future growth trend of Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara), a tree of high commercial importance, and explored its spatial growth variability under two different climatic regimes from 17 deodar sites in the HKH. Of the two climate regimes, one is dominated by the monsoon rainfall and the other by the westerly disturbances. Analysis of tree ring width and climate (monthly temperature and precipitation) data reveals that the spring (March-May) temper-ature and precipitation affect the growth of deodar negatively and positively, respectively. We used Generalized Least Squares (GLS) regression model to forecast future growth of deodar by taking an ensemble of 40 General Circulation Models (GCMs) for emission scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Predicted growth trends indicate the decline between 34 % and 38 % under RCP 4.5, and between 29 % and 32 % under RCP 8.5 scenarios, for the low and mid latitude sites. In contrast, a moderate increase in growth was observed in high latitude sites under the both climate scenarios. The study shows more drought stress to deodar trees growing in monsoon areas in mid-and low-latitude sites where less snow melt and low precipitation during the spring season are predicted to increase evapotranspiration. In compar-ison, in the higher latitude sites where there is a high snowfall due to western disturbances, the growth of deodar is predicted to increase. These findings may be used to take suitable migratory steps for the conservation of deodar in the HKH region.","[Bhattacharyya, Amalava; Shekhar, Mayank; Ranhotra, Parminder Singh] Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosciences, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, India; [Dhyani, Rupesh; Kuniyal, Jagdish Chandra] Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Kosi 263643, Uttaranchal, India; [Joshi, Rajesh] G B Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Sikkim Reg Ctr, Pangthang 737103, Sikkim, India; [Singh, Surendra Pratap] Cent Himalayan Environm Assoc, Dehra Dun 248001, India",,"Bhattacharyya, A (corresponding author), Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosciences, 53 Univ Rd, Lucknow 226007, India.;Kuniyal, JC (corresponding author), Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Kosi 263643, Uttaranchal, India.;Joshi, R (corresponding author), G B Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Sikkim Reg Ctr, Pangthang 737103, Sikkim, India.",amalava@yahoo.com; dr.rajeshjoshi@gmail.com; jckuniyal@gmail.com,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 15,2023,882.0,,,,,,,,163630,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163630,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163630,,APR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001002241900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents a brief review of the glacier mass balance status and their analysis under the changing climate in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). The reported results of mass balance in the region give the status of continuous negative mass balance with few exceptions for a year or two reflecting the overall negative mass balance with increasing trend in recent decades. This has coordination with continuous increasing pattern of temperature and decreasing (few not significant) pattern of precipitation. The continuous negative mass balance and rising temperature in the region clearly indicate the impact of warming in reducing the storage of snow and ice in the region with the future implication of shortage of fresh water availability in the snow-glacier fed river system.

These include slope gradient, slope aspect, plan curvature, elevation, relative relief, Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA), distance from epicenters of the mainshock and major aftershocks, lithology, distance of the landslide from the fault, fold, and drainage line. The success rate of 87.66% and the prediction rate of 86.87% indicate that the model is in good agreement between the developed susceptibility map and the existing landslides data.

Anthropogenic land and resource use changes related to climate change can also impact the survival of wildlife. Thus, climate change has to be integrated into biodiversity conservation plans. We developed a hybrid approach to climate-adaptive conservation landscape planning for snow leopards in the Himalayan Mountains. We first mapped current snow leopard habitat using a mechanistic approach that incorporated field-based data, and then combined it with a climate impact model using a correlative approach. For the latter, we used statistical methods to test hypotheses about climatic drivers of treeline in the Himalaya and its potential response to climate change under three IPCC greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. We then assessed how change in treeline might affect the distribution of snow leopard habitat. Results indicate that about 30% of snow leopard habitat in the Himalaya may be lost due to a shifting treeline and consequent shrinking of the alpine zone, mostly along the southern edge of the range and in river valleys. But, a considerable amount of snow leopard habitat and linkages are likely to remain resilient to climate change, and these should be secured. This is because, as the area of snow leopard habitat fragments and shrinks, threats such as livestock grazing, retaliatory killing, and medicinal plant collection can intensify. We propose this approach for landscape conservation planning for other species with extensive spatial requirements that can also be umbrella species for overall biodiversity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A growing body of evidence has shown that large earthquakes severely impact on forest ecosystems, particularly in mountain regions. However, little is known about the impact of severe earthquakes on Himalayan forests. Herein, we analyzed tree radial growth patterns following major earthquakes that occurred in 1833, 1905, 1916, 1934, and 1936 in the Himalayas. Based on 46 tree-ring sites, 77%, 64%, 73%, 72%, and 77% of total analyzed trees showed responses to these seismic events, respectively. On average, 72% of responsive trees undergo growth suppressions following the earthquake events. Superposed epoch analysis showed a strong growth decline 1-5 years after the earthquake. A negative relationship was found between the percentage of responsive trees and the distance of the tree-ring site from the earthquake's epicenter. The mean time required for 75% of trees to recover reached 5, 5, 5, 13, and 28 years following the earthquake of 1833, 1905, 1916, 1934, and 1936, respectively. The recovery time after a low growth period showed a negative relationship with the distance to earthquake's epicenter. However, the growth resistance improved with increasing distance from the epicenter. Thus, forests located close to earthquakes' epicenters can serve as reliable archive for the reconstruction of earthquakes' impacts. As the Himalayas are prone to earthquakes, adaptive management strategies are required to minimize the impacts of earthquakes on the mountain forest ecosystem.","[Pandey, Jayram; Lu, Xiaoming; Sigdel, Shalik Ram; Gao, Shan; Liang, Eryuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Pandey, Jayram] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Camarero, J.

The selection of study areas in most studies is random and depends on a variety of parameters such as the number of landslide occurrences, availability of preparatory causal factors or conditioning factors, availability of computational resources. However, the selected study area and mapping unit may not represent landslide occurrences in the whole basin or landslide susceptibility of the region. This work analyses and problematizes the effect of scale (smaller to the larger, i.e., basin-wise to micro-watershed) in preparation of LSM based on various landslide conditioning factors. The study has been carried out in the Mandakini river basin of Garhwal Himalaya, Uttarakhand. To evaluate the effect of geographical and computational scale, we have divided the river basin into ten sub-basins and further into 88 micro-watersheds. The study considers an inventory of 229 landslides (consisting of approximately 6000 pixels) and seven predisposing factors of landslide occurrence, i.e., aspect, elevation, geology, slope, soil, the buffer of streams, and buffer of thrusts. To compare the effect of scale, we have used two widely known techniques, namely Fisher discriminant analysis and logistic regression. The results of this study are validated on more than 230 landslide locations provided by the Geological Survey of India using the Heidke skill score, which is preferred for the assessment of rare events in predictive analysis. We conclude that logistic regression performs better for the whole basin and sub-basins. However, discriminant analysis performs better for micro-watersheds.

At present, the data on trace elements (TEs) concentrations and dynamics over the high-altitude Himalayan region are scarce and has received less attention. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the TEs concentration and depositional pattern at Dokriani Glacier, central Himalaya to understand their levels, dynamics, and potential effects. A total of 39 samples were collected from two snowpit stratigraphies, deposited during non-monsoon period and monsoonal precipitation between 4530 to 4630 m a.s.l. altitude in the year 2017. The results of analyzed trace metals (Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Sr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, As, and Pb) showed high enrichment values for Zn, Cr, Co, Ni and Mn compared to other parts of the Himalayan region, suggesting the influence of anthropogenic emissions (e.g., fossil fuel, metal production, and industrial processes) from urbanized areas of South Asia. Our results also revealed the possible health effects related to the enrichment of Zn and Cd, which may be responsible for skin-related diseases in Uttarakhand region. We attribute increasing anthropogenic activities in the environment to have a significant impact on the ecosystem health of the central Himalayan region. This study provides the baseline information on TEs concentration and sources in the Himalayas, which needs wide dissemination to scientific community as well as policymakers. Therefore, systematic observations, management, and preparing action plan to overcome the health effects from TEs pollution are urgently needed over the remote, pristine Himalayan region.","[Sundriyal, Shipika] Natl Inst Hydrol, Environm & Hydrol Div, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shukla, Tanuj] Indian Inst Technol, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Tripathee, Lekhendra] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Dobhal, Dwarika Prashad] Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, 33 GMS Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Sundriyal, S (corresponding author), Natl Inst Hydrol, Environm & Hydrol Div, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sipikasundriyal18@gmail.com,,,,,,,,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2020,27.0,3,,,,,3462,3472,,10.1007/s11356-019-07102-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-07102-w,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000514849100080,View Full Record in Web of Science

Upon successful modelling, we assessed climate change impacts on their distribution in the Himalayan arc extending from the Indian borders in the west to the hills in Myanmar. Out of 34 Galliformes species occurring in the Himalayan arc, 21 species were retained in this study, rest were dropped due to very low occurrences. Best performing variables from the set of environmental variables (n = 36) consisting of topography, vegetation, soil, anthropogenic indices and bioclimatic factors were tested for collinearity. Ordination (PCA and NMDS) and clustering (hierarchical clustering, agnes, partitioning around medoids and k-means clustering) and Species Archetype Modelling (SAM) methods were performed for finding the archetypal cohorts among the species. The clusters were used for two different modelling frameworks- Species Distribution Models (SDMs) with a combination of biophysical and topographical parameters; and Bioclimatic Envelope Models (BEMs) with only bioclimatic variables. Predicted climate-driven changes in species ranges (year 2070, RCP 4.5 and 8.5) were assessed. The 21 species were clustered in four groups. Precipitation emerged as the overall significant driving factor for all the three clusters. Random Forest was the highest performing model across the clusters. Two cluster restricted to the eastern Himalayas were found to be the most affected in a climate change scenario. Cluster belonging to the western Himalayas was predicted to lose about 70% of its bioclimatic habitats in both the scenarios.

Several researches reported that the hydrological regime of these Himalayan rivers is vulnerable to climate change. In order to understand the hydrologic response of their headwaters and examine the climate change impacts on streamflow, a hydrological modelling study is carried out in the upper part of the Satluj river basin in western Himalaya by using a temperature index based SWAT (SoilWater Assessment Tool) model. The model performed well for both calibration (years 1986-2000) and validation (2001-2005) periods against the observed daily streamflow at Rampur (R-2 approximate to 0.9 and NSE = 0.85). The study reveals that having a larger snow covered area, the snowmelt runoff is the major contributor to the Satluj river discharge at Rampur that comes out to be about 68-71% of the average annual water yield of about 600 mm. The actual evapotranspiration comes out to be about 14% of precipitation. The water yield of the basin is about 50% of the precipitation, for which the major part is generated in early summer. Further, to study the climate change impact on future streamflow, the downscaled data of CORDEX CCSM4 under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios are used. The bias correction is applied at point level to remove biases from future time series of downscaled data and subsequently loaded into the SWAT model to simulate the future streamflows at the end of the century. The future climate variability in terms of precipitation and temperature exhibited that the climate in the region would become wetter and warmer. A 14% to 21% of increase in annual precipitation is predicted towards the end of the century from the current average annual precipitation of about 420 mm under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Similar to precipitation, the temperature will also be increased by 2.18 degrees C to 5.71 degrees C (in both the RCPs) than the current temperature values. The changed climate conditions in future are transformed into the possible range of stream flows using the SWAT model and found that the future climate would increase the streamflow by over 11%-19% at the end of the century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. The outcome of this study can be used to develop the suitable strategies for sustainable water management in the region. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

These RCMs downscaled a subset of atmosphere ocean coupled global climate models (AOGCMs) in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) to higher 50 km spatial resolution over a large domain covering South Asia for two representation concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) future scenarios. The analysis specifically examined and evaluated multi-model and multi-scenario climate change projections over the hilly sub-regions within HKH for the near-future (2036-2065) and far-future (2066-2095) periods. The downscaled multi-RCMs provide relatively better confidence than their driving AOGCMs in projecting the magnitude of seasonal warming for the hilly sub-region within the Karakoram and northwestern Himalaya, with higher projected change of 5.4 degrees C during winter than of 4.9 degrees C during summer monsoon season by the end of 21st century under the high-end emissions (RCP8.5) scenario. There is less agreement among these RCMs on the magnitude of the projected warming over the other sub-regions within HKH for both seasons, particularly associated with higher RCM uncertainty for the hilly sub-region within the central Himalaya. The downscaled multi-RCMs show good consensus and low RCM uncertainty in projecting that the summer monsoon precipitation will intensify by about 22% in the hilly sub-region within the southeastern Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau for the far-future period under the RCP8.5 scenario. There is low confidence in the projected changes in the summer monsoon and winter season precipitation over the central Himalaya and in the Karakoram and northwestern Himalaya due to poor consensus and moderate to high RCM uncertainty among the downscaled multi-RCMs. Finally, the RCM related uncertainty is found to be large for the projected changes in seasonal temperature and precipitation over the hilly sub-regions within HKH by the end of this century, suggesting that improving the regional processes and feedbacks in RCMs are essential for narrowing the uncertainty, and for providing more reliable regional climate change projections suitable for impact assessments in HKH region.","[Sanjay, Jayanarayanan; Krishnan, Raghavan] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Shrestha, Arun Bhakta] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu 3226, Nepal; [Rajbhandari, Rupak] Tribhuvan Univ, Dept Meteorol, Trichandra Campus, Kathmandu 3226, Nepal; [Ren Guo-Yu] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Climate Ctr, Lab Climate Studies, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",,"Sanjay, J (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India.",sanjay@tropmet.res.in,,,,,,,,93.0,97.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2017,8.0,3,,,SI,,185,198,,10.1016/j.accre.2017.08.003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.accre.2017.08.003,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000413286500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

An absence of substantial place-based knowledge and failed developmental initiatives due to absence of holistic approach in Himalaya has motivated to conduct a systematic review. In this study, we systematically review peer-reviewed literature focused on SESs (n = 53) in the Himalayan countries (Bhutan, China, India, Nepal, and Pakistan). The review summarizes the existing knowledge of Himalayan SES scholarship. It documents the trends and distribution of Himalayan SESs and its scholarship. We examined the year-wise, spatial (geographical), and methodological trends in SES discourse. The review appraises the conceptualization of the term SES. Further, major drivers impacting the Himalayan SESs are identified and discussed. Our findings highlight that 87% of literature has attempted country-specific study, with Nepal and India in the lead. Such a spatial disparity compounded by the complexity arising from a dearth of inconsistent conceptualization, cross-scale interactions and geospatial exploration of Himalayan SESs mask the deeper realities of unique Himalayan SESs. Thus, we advocate for a comprehensive definition and characteristic attributes of SES while considering cross-scale interactions and inherent mountain specificities. The decisions that direct sustainable development of Himalaya are made locally, and these decisions are influenced by social and ecological values. Targeting locally perceived characteristics attributes of SES in decision-making can ensure sustainable future of Himalaya.","[Shruthi Gopirajan, A. T.; Kumar, Praveen; Joshi, P.

Evaluating the potential socio-economic impact of GLOFs is essential for risk mitigation and enhancing community resilience. Yet in most of the cases, this is confronted with the challenges of limited availability of data and inaccessibility to most of the glacial lakes in the high-altitude areas. This study aims to exploit open data from different sources and high-performance hydrodynamic modelling to develop a new framework for GLOF exposure and impact assessment. In the new framework, different GLOF scenarios are created using a simple dam breach model. A high-performance hydrodynamic model is then adopted to simulate the resulting flood hydrodynamics. Necessary socio-economic information is collected and processed from multiple sources including OpenStreetMap, Google Earth, and global data products to support exposure analysis. Established depth-damage curves are used to assess the GLOF damage extents to different exposed objects and an existing fatality estimating procedure is adopted to assess the potential loss of lives. The evaluation framework is applied to the Tsho Rolpa glacial lake in Nepal. From the results, the worst GLOF scenario as considered can potentially inundate 1647 buildings, impact 5038 people and hit 123 key facilities including schools, hospitals, airports, hydropower plants, etc. It may substantially damage 900 buildings, 10.63 km(2) of agricultural land and 50.9 km roads and may potentially lead to 45 deaths even if warning is available.

J,"Dahal, RK",,,,"Dahal, Ranjan Kumar",,,Regional-scale landslide activity and landslide susceptibility zonation in the Nepal Himalaya,ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Landslide susceptibility zonation mapping is a fundamental procedure for geo-disaster management in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Recently, various landslide susceptibility zonation models have been introduced in Nepal with diverse approaches of assessment. However, validation is still a problem. Additionally, the role of various predisposing causative parameters for landslide activity is still not well understood in the Nepal Himalaya. To address these issues of susceptibility zonation and landslide activity, about 4,000 km(2) area of central Nepal was selected for regional-scale assessment of landslide activity and susceptibility zonation mapping. In total, 655 new landslides and 9,229 old landslides were identified with the study area with the help of satellite images, aerial photographs, field data and available reports. The old landslide inventory was blind landslide database and could not explain the particular rainfall event responsible for the particular landslide. But considering size of the landslide, blind landslide inventory was reclassified into two databases: short-duration high-intensity rainfall-induced landslide inventory and long-duration low-intensity rainfall-induced landslide inventory. These landslide inventory maps were considered as proxy maps of multiple rainfall event-based landslide inventories. Similarly, all 9,884 landslides were considered for the activity assessment of predisposing causative parameters. For the Nepal Himalaya, slope, slope aspect, geology and road construction activity (anthropogenic cause) were identified as most affective predisposing causative parameters for landslide activity. For susceptibility zonation, multivariate approach was considered and two proxy rainfall event-based landslide databases were used for the logistic regression modelling, while a relatively recent landslide database was used in validation. Two event-based susceptibility zonation maps were merged and rectified to prepare the final susceptibility zonation map and its prediction rate was found to be more than 82 %. From this work, it is concluded that rectification of susceptibility zonation map is very appropriate and reliable. The results of this research contribute to a significant improvement in landslide inventory preparation procedure, susceptibility zonation mapping approaches as well as role of various predisposing causative parameters for the landslide activity.","Tribhuvan Univ, Dept Geol, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Dahal, RK (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Dept Geol, Tri Chandra Campus, Kathmandu, Nepal.",ranjan@ranjan.net.np,,,,,,,,20.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2014,71.0,12,,,,,5145,5164,,10.1007/s12665-013-2917-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-013-2917-7,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000336397100017,View Full Record in Web of Science

These lakes have the potential to release catastrophic volumes of water and trigger a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). GLOFs can cause devastating downstream impacts including loss of lives, damage to infrastructure, and economic loss. The risk associated with GLOFs is evident in the case of the Mochowar and the Shisper glaciers of the Hunza valley in the Karakoram ranges. The present study is divided in two parts: 1) investigation of the recent GLOF event from the Shisper glacier ice-dammed lake on 7th May 2022. 2) identification of an overdeepening site for future lake formation at the Mochowar glacier and its future GLOF sus-ceptibility; We used the Himalayan Glacier Thickness Mapper (HIGTHIM) to calculate the thickness of Mochowar gla-cier and identify an overdeepening site at its terminus. This site could host a glacial lake of area 0.22 km2 and a mean depth of 58.97 m that can release a potential flood volume leading to cascading effects with the Shisper ice-dammed lake that further increases the GLOF susceptibility. The GLOF susceptibility of this future lake was determined to be high based on a multi-criterion decision analysis. The recent GLOF event of 7th May 2022 occurred from the Shisper glacier ice-dammed lake. We applied a 2D hydrodynamic model for investigating this GLOF episode and estimated a release volume of 6.23 x 106 m3, with a modelled peak discharge of approximately 1505 m3s-1.","[Singh, Hemant; Varade, Divyesh] Indian Inst Technol Jammu, Dept Civil Engn, Jagti, India; [de Vries, Maximillian Van Wyk] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L3 5DA, England; [de Vries, Maximillian Van Wyk] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England; [Adhikari, Kirtan] Royal Univ Bhutan, Coll Sci & Technol, Thimphu, Bhutan; [Rawat, Manish] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Water Resource Dev & Management, Roorkee, India; [Awasthi, Shubham; Rawat, Deepak] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Ctr Excellence Disaster Management, Roorkee, India",,"Varade, D (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Jammu, Dept Civil Engn, Jagti, India.;de Vries, MV (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford, England.",hemant.singh@iitjammu.ac.in; divyesh.varade@iitjammu.ac.in; vanwy048@umn.edu; adhikari.cst@rub.edu.bt; manish.wr@sric.iitr.ac.in; sawasthi@dm.iitr.ac.in; drawat1@dm.iitr.ac.in,,,,,,,,14.0,15.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR 10,2023,868.0,,,,,,,,161717,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161717,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.161717,,JAN 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000931532400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Amongst them, the impacts on local tourism, although being substantial, have not been studied so far. The aim of this research is to analyze the characteristics of such landslides and their influence on road damages and/or blockages as well as on local tourism industry. We analyzed the co-seismic landslides triggered by the Gorkha Earthquake, 2015 (7.8 Mw), the post-seismic landslides that occurred during the monsoons following the earthquake, as well as landslides which occurred or reactivated in 2018, with relation to the damage that they caused to the highway. High resolution satellite images from 2015 to 2018, and field data were used for the analysis. The Langtang avalanche that locates off the highway was also mapped due to its high impacts on tourism. Between 2015 and 2018, the number of road damaging landslides in the Betrawati-Rasuwagadhi section of KKH (where Dhunche and Syafrubesi towns are located) was 101 in the main track (MT) and 103 in the new track (NT), with respective average density of 1.46/km and 3.63/km. The dominant observed landslide types were debris slides and rock falls. Landslides were mostly concentrated in the locations with the following characteristics: 1) having higher elevated area, 2) being located with the 'main central thrust' and other lineaments' belts, 3) belonging to the Proterozoic lesser Himalayan rocks, 4) having a slope gradient of 25 degrees-45 degrees, 5) having northern, western and southern slope aspect, 6) being subjected to annual normal rainfall of higher than 1,000 mm, and 7) having less than 4 km distance from the past earthquake epicenters. The results further indicated that 7 rain-induced and 4 co- and post-seismic landslides have great impact on tourist flows. An impact analysis was also assessed through a door to door questionnaire survey with local hotel operators from Dhunche and Syafrubesi towns (n= 29 + 31). The results reveal that out of six rigorously affected sectors by landslides leading to road blockage, tourism business is the most impacted livelihood sector in these towns. The reduction of visitors in different hotels ranged from 50%-100% in Dhunche and 70%-100% in Syafrubesi for the first year aftermath of the tremor. This is lower than the respective 5%-50% tourist reduction due to rain-induced landslides. Using as a reference the base year 2014, the income loss of hotels in both towns was found to be 50%-100% in 2015, 20%-100% in 2016, 5%-75% in 2017, and similar to 35% in 2018. These results provide insights on the synergic effect of contributing factors for cut slope as well as down slope instability along mountainous motorways and their impact on income sources for local communities.","[Dhakal, Susmita; Cui Peng; Su Li-juni; Zou Qiang; Wu Chun-hao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazard & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Dhakal, Susmita; Cui Peng; Su Li-juni] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Dhakal, Susmita] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Environm Sci, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Cui Peng; Su Li-juni] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Rijal, Chandra Prasad] Govt Nepal, Tourism Search & Rescue Guidance Comm, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Su Li-juni] China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Mavrouli, Olga] Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands",,"Cui, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazard & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.;Cui, P (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Cui, P (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",susmita.dhakal@gmail.com; pengcui@imde.ac.cn; ijal_cp@yahoo.com; sulijun1976@163.com; zouqiang@imde.ac.cn; o.c.mavrouli@utwente.nl; 92126wch@163.com,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2020,17.0,8,,,,,1840,1859,,10.1007/s11629-019-5871-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-019-5871-3,,JUL 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000550614300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, 429 glaciers were examined in the Kanchenjunga region in the middle of the Himalayas. Geodetic methods, feature-based image matching, and multi-parametric integrated approaches were used to detect differences of glacier change and the dominant characteristics driving these differences based on digital elevation models (DEMs), Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images, Envisat/ASAR and Sentinel-1 data. The results showed that the average change rates in glacier area and surface elevation in 1975-2015 were -0.18 +/- 0.07% a 1 and - 0.32 +/- 0.02 m a(-1), respectively. The rates of areal shrinkage of glaciers and the glacier surface velocity on the northern side of the Himalayan crest were 1.25 and 1.7 times larger than those of the glaciers on the southern slopes, respectively, whereas the rates of glacier thinning were lower in the north than in the south. The temperature increase from 1975 to 2015 caused an overall widespread glacier retreat in the region. However, differences in the topography of the Kanchenjunga region led to spatial variability in glacier changes with discrepancies as large as several times. The features of individual glaciers, such as glacier size, debris cover, and development of ice-contact glacial lakes enhanced the local complexity of glacier change and elusive response behaviors of the glaciers to-climate warming led by the different topographic conditions.

As per the predictions, there will be a significant reduction in the geographic distribution of the indicator species under the with wildfire' scenario as compared to the without wildfire' scenario. The future distribution range was shifted towards the northern and north-eastern regions of our study area owing to higher moisture availability. We predicted reduction in the range of C. deodara during 2030, R. arboreum during 2050, and P. roxburghii during 2080, while the distribution of Q. semecarpifolia remained unchanged.

Using multi-date satellite images from 2000 to 2020, we investigated the shrinkage, snout retreat, thickness changes, mass loss and velocity changes of 77 glaciers in the Drass basin, western Himalaya, India. During this period, the total glacier cover has shrunk by 5.31 +/- 0.33 km(2). The snout retreat ranged from 30 to 430 m (mean 155 +/- 9.58 m). Debris cover had a significant impact on glacier melting, with clean glaciers losing 5% more than debriscovered glaciers (similar to 2%). The average thickness change and mass loss of glacier have been similar to 1.27 +/- 0.37 and similar to 1.08 +/- 0.31 m(-1) w.e.a(-1), respectively.

During the observation period, the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs), black carbon (BC) and other pollutants from vehicular traffic near the glaciers increased significantly. Increasing temperatures, caused by a significant increase in GHGs, black carbon and other pollutants in the atmosphere, are driving glacier melting in the study area. If the current trend continues in the future, the Himalayan glaciers may disappear entirely, having a significant impact on regional water supplies, hydrological processes, ecosystem services and transboundary water sharing.","[Romshoo, Shakil Ahmad; Murtaza, Khalid Omar; Shah, Waheed; Ramzan, Tawseef; Ameen, Ummer; Bhat, Mustafa Hameed] Univ Kashmir, Dept Geoinformat, Srinagar, India",,"Romshoo, SA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Geoinformat, Srinagar, India.",shakilrom@kashmiruniversity.ac.in,,,,,,,,20.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2022,29.0,35,,,,,52732,52751,,10.1007/s11356-022-19524-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19524-0,,MAR 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000767063900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We delineate riverine ecotones along an elevational gradient in the western Himalaya by examining community turnover of freshwater macroinvertebrates. Using the Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN), we provide a set of indicator macroinvertebrate taxa that represent the altitudinal band of greatest community turnover. Out of a total of 31 taxa, 11 were identified as indicators, responding either positively (n = 2) or negatively (n = 9) to altitude. Further, assessments of community turnover points toward a potential 'riverine ecotone' for the western Himalayan streams at an altitudinal band of 1442-2447 m above sea level (asl). As ecotones are transitional bands that harbour communities most sensitive to climate change, we further compared them across different latitudes of Himalaya to ascertain the differences in climate sensitive zones across latitudes. Our comparisons reveal that as we move towards higher latitudes in the Himalaya, the climate sensitivity drops to a lower elevational range of 1442-2447 m above sea level at 31 degrees 33 '-31 degrees 43 ' N. In contrast, at lower latitudes (27 degrees 51 '-28 degrees 23 ' N) the riverine ecotones have been recorded at a much higher elevation of 2900-3500 m above sea level. Through our study, we delimit that lower elevations in western Himalaya warrant concentrated long-term monitoring efforts to track species responses to climate change. Our comparisons of riverine ecotones along latitudes unlock new insights to understand the macroecology of community turnovers in riverine ecosystems.","[Dubey, Vineet Kumar; Sharma, Aashna; Borah, Himangshu; Johnson, Jeyaraj Antony; Sivakumar, Kuppusamy] Wildlife Inst India, 18 Chandrabani, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Sivakumar, Kuppusamy] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India",,"Sivakumar, K (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, 18 Chandrabani, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.;Sivakumar, K (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India.",ksivakumarwii@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2023,85.0,2,,,,,,,63,10.1007/s00027-023-00963-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-023-00963-x,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000964122300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Projected temperature and precipitation from NASA's Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) data set were used. The projected snow parameters, namely, snow depth, snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow cover (%) of five global climatic models (GCMs) were downloaded from Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCDMI) web portal.

When compared with the baseline period, all the snow parameters in both the river basins were projected to decrease with the highest decline in the 90s under RCP 8.5. The result obtained from this study suggested that the summer seasons could get wetter and the winter season drier in the future in both the river basin. The streamflow in the future was projected to increase as we move from near (30s) to far (90s) future under both RCPs. The highest change in streamflow was projected in the 90s for both the RCPs.

The study analysed carbon (C) stock patterns and examined the importance of environmental variables in predicting carbon stock in biomass and soils of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). We conducted a synthesis of 100 studies reporting biomass carbon stock and 67 studies on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock from four land-uses: forests, plantation, agroforest, and herbaceous ecosystem from the IHR. Machine learning techniques were used to examine the importance of various environmental variables in predicting carbon stock in biomass and soils. Despite large variations in biomass C and SOC stock (mean +/- SD) within the land-uses, natural forests have the highest biomass C stock (138.5 +/- 87.3 Mg C ha(-1)), and plantation forests exhibited the highest SOC stock (168.8 +/- 74.4 Mg C ha(-1)) in the top 1-mof soils. The relationship between the environmental variables (altitude, latitude, precipitation, and temperature) and carbon stock was not significantly correlated. The prediction of biomass carbon and SOC stock using different machine learning techniques (Adaboost, Bagging, Random Forest, and XGBoost) shows that the XGBoost model can predict the carbon stock for the IHR closely. Our study confirms that the carbon stock in the IHR vary on a large scale due to a diverse range of land-use and ecosystems within the region. Therefore, predicting the driver of carbon stock on a single environmental variable is impossible for the entire IHR. The IHR possesses a prominent carbon sink and biodiversity pool. Therefore, its protection is essential in fulfilling India's commitment to nationally determined contributions (NDC). Our data synthesis may also provide a baseline for the precise estimation of carbon stock, which will be vital for India's National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE).

They offer valuable insights into how shifting temperature and precipitation patterns affect ecosystems in treeline ecotones. Analyzing the age structure of tree stands at treelines provides a glimpse into how different generations of trees have responded to changing environmental conditions and aids in predicting future changes. Moreover, studying the spatiotemporal distribution of tree species at treelines helps us gain a comprehensive understanding of how forests adapt to climate variations. Tree rings at treelines can elucidate the climatic factors that limit tree growth and establishment patterns. Mountain environments, characterized by low temperatures at higher elevations, create constraints on tree growth. However, the intricate interplay between temperature and water availability, driven by precipitation gradients, means that predicting treeline shifts based solely on temperature changes is overly simplistic and may not fully reflect the complex reality. To assess the potential for such interactions, we contrasted the dendroecological performance of different tree species (Abies spectabilis, Betula utilis, Abies georgei, and Larix potaninii) in the Trans-Himalayan zone, Nepal, and Hengduan Mountains, China. We reconstructed the stand age structure by using dendrochronology. Statistical determination of climate-growth responses demonstrated that treeline is moisture-sensitive in the Himalaya and temperature- as well as moisture-sensitive in the Hengduan region. There was abundant seedling recruitment with consistent range shift of A. spectabilis and B. utilis treelines in Nepal, and lower seedling recruitment with lower shifting rates of treelines of A. georgei and L. potaninii in the Hengduan Mountains. We identify both moisture and temperature as critical environmental factors in determining tree radial growth and treeline response to climate. However, modifying factors such as microhabitat conditions and biotic interactions are also highly important to improve the accuracy of treeline dynamics.","[Tiwari, Achyut] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kirtipur, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Tiwari, Achyut; Fan, Ze-Xin; Li, Shu-Feng; Zhou, Zhe-Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Adhikari, Arjun] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, 008c Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Jump, Alistair S.] Univ Stirling, Fac Nat Sci, Biol & Environm Sci, Stirling FK9 4LA, England; [Zhou, Zhe-Kun] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Key Lab Biogeog & Biodivers, Kunming 650204, Peoples R China",,"Tiwari, A (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kirtipur, Kathmandu, Nepal.;Tiwari, A (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",achyut.tiwari@cdb.tu.edu.np,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2023,23.0,4,,,,,,,157,10.1007/s10113-023-02153-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-023-02153-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001101423900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies have explained heterogeneous responses in qualitative ways but quantitative assessment is lacking yet where an intrazone homogeneous climate assumption can be valid. Hence, in the current study, the reason for heterogeneous mass balance has been explained in quantitative methods using a multiple linear regression model in the Sikkim Himalayan region. At first, the topographical parameters are selected from previously published studies, then the most significant topographical and geomorphological parameters are selected with backward stepwise subset selection methods. Finally, the contributions of selected parameters are calculated by least square methods. The results show that, the magnitude of mass balance lies between -0.003 & PLUSMN;0.24 to -1.029 & PLUSMN;0.24 m.w.e.a(-1) between 2000 and 2020 in the Sikkim Himalaya region. Also, the study shows that, out of the terminus type of the glacier, glacier area, debris cover, ice-mixed debris, slope, aspect, mean elevation, and snout elevation of the glaciers, only the terminus type and mean elevation of the glacier are significantly altering the glacier mass balance in the Sikkim Himalayan region. Mathematically, the mass loss is approximately 0.40 m.w.e.a(-1) higher in the lake-terminating glaciers compared to the land-terminating glaciers in the same elevation zone. On the other hand, a thousand meters mean elevation drop is associated with 0.179 m.w.e.a(-1) of mass loss despite the terminus type of the glaciers. In the current study, the model using the terminus type of the glaciers and the mean elevation of the glaciers explains 76% of fluctuation of mass balance in the Sikkim Himalayan region.","[Guha, Supratim; Tiwari, Reet Kamal] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Geomat Engn Lab, Ropar 140001, Punjab, India",,"Tiwari, RK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Geomat Engn Lab, Ropar 140001, Punjab, India.",reetkamal@iitrpr.ac.in,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2023,20.0,7,,,,,1854,1864,,10.1007/s11629-022-7829-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-022-7829-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001035655000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we evaluated the impact of different migration constraints on projected future distributions of four high elevation frogs, belonging to the genus Scutiger, in the Eastern Himalaya. We explored differences between the output of conventional models assuming no or unlimited migration versus models considering plausible migration rates to ascertain future species distributions under climate change. Distributions of the four Scutiger species, namely S. boulengeri, S. glandulatus, S. sikirrunesis and S. tuberculatus, based on field data and other sources were modelled using MaxEnt and projected for three future time periods (2021-2040; 2041-2060; 2061-2080) under the relatively ambitious RCP4.5 and the more pessimistic RCP8.5 climate change scenarios using three global circulation models. Projected species distributions were compared at different spatial resolutions (1 km, 5 km and 10 km) and for five assumptions about species migration: (1) no migration; (2-4) low, medium and high migration abilities using the KISSMig model; and (5) unlimited migration. Without migration, the projected future distribution of all four species showed a significant decrease of - 15% to - 64% by 2080. In contrast, three out of the four study species were projected to expand their distribution under unlimited migration scenarios. Models with more realistic migration rates, however, demonstrated considerable deviance from both no migration and unlimited migration scenarios. These results were consistent across models with different spatial resolutions.

The responses of karst springs to hydrometeorological factors vary depending on local conditions. In this study, we investigated Martandnag spring in the Liddar catchment in the Kashmir valley of northern India. We used statistical time series (autocorrelation and cross-correlation) and machine-learning (ML) techniques (random forest regression (RFR) and support vector regression (SVR)) to characterize how rainfall, temperature, and snow cover affect the karst spring flow and predict the future responses of the spring stage based on climate scenarios, in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report 6. The statistical time series showed that the memory effect of Martandnag spring varies from 43 to 61 days, indicating moderate karstification and a relatively high storage capacity of the karst aquifer in the Liddar catchment. The delay between recharge and discharge varies from 13 to 44 days, and it is more strongly correlated to snow/ice melt than to rainfall. The ML analysis shows that SVR outperformed RFR in predicting spring flow. Under all climate scenarios, a trained SVR model showed that spring flow increased during the late winter to early spring, and decreased during the summer (except in August) and in autumn. Scenarios with increased greenhouse gas emissions further reduced flow in the summer and autumn. These predictions can be helpful for water-resource planning in similar watersheds in the Western Himalayas.","[Sarker, Shishir K.; Zhu, Junfeng; Fryar, Alan E.] Univ Kentucky, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Zhu, Junfeng] Univ Kentucky, Kentucky Geol Survey, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Jeelani, Ghulam] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, India",,"Fryar, AE (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",sksa232@uky.edu; junfeng.zhu@uky.edu; alan.fryar@uky.edu; geojeelani@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 26,2023,15.0,11,,,,,,,8666,10.3390/su15118666,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15118666,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001005371600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Farmers are frequently seen adopting several adaptation measures, which are neither equally efficient nor mutually exclusive. Based on the primary data collected from 300 farming households of the Indian Eastern Himalayan foothills, the present study attempts to examine the efficiency of local farmers' adaptation by developing indices combining the feasibility, effectiveness, and sustainability of the adaptation measures with the scale of actual adoption. Further, by employing multiple linear regression, the study analyzes the internal (psychological) and external (physical and socio-economic) factors influencing higher scores of these indices. Results show that local farmers are well aware of climate change and are responding through implementing at least one and up to seven adaptation measures. Farmers preferred agroforestry, a shift from cereals to low water-intensive commercials, irrigation, and intensification of winter crops as the most efficient. There was, however, a misalignment between the perceived efficiency of adaptation measures and their scale of adoption. Farmers' perceptions of pest infestation, satisfaction with farming, soil characteristics, farm size, remittances, and access to credit were found to be positively and significantly influencing the adaptation indices, while open-mindedness toward changing farming practices and crop-raiding by elephants were found to be negatively and significantly associated with adaptation indices. Lastly, the study made relevant recommendations for improving farmers' efficiency in adopting appropriate adaptation measures and strengthening the State Action Plan on Climate Change.","[Datta, Pritha; Behera, Bhagirath] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",,"Datta, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",dattapritha3@gmail.com,,,,,,,,8.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2022,70.0,6,,,,,911,925,,10.1007/s00267-022-01724-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-022-01724-6,,SEP 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000859705100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Climate warming has drastically influenced the composition of alpine vegetation globally leading to threats of biodiversity loss. Himalaya, a rich biodiversity hotspot, have also been experiencing such warming effects in the recent decades. However, its impact on the Himalayan ecosystem especially on the alpine vegetation is not yet studied in detail. Therefore, we established permanent monitoring plots (PMPs) on three summits of Indian north-western Himalayan region in 2014 at one of the benchmark sites identified and selected under the aegis of Himalayan Alpine Dynamics Research Initiative (HIMADRI) network for long-term monitoring of alpine vegetation following Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA) multi-summit protocols. These summits are along an elevation gradient from 3600 to 3900 m. Data from PMPs were recorded in the years 2015 and 2020. Over the period of these years, mean annual soil temperature has been found to increase significantly with more increase observed in the summer mean temperature of upper alpine (3900 m) summit. Increase in species richness and plant cover percentage were also observed. The changes in beta and zeta diversity indices revealed Homogenization of biotic communities. Thermophilization was found more pronounced in the lower alpine summits. The study provides the baseline scientific data of alpine communities of the region in response to climate. Thus, this study will serve as an effort towards filling the knowledge gaps in the less explored regions of Indian north-western Himalaya. Continued studies in the present site and further explorations in other parts of alpine eco-regions of Himalaya are necessary, which has greater implications for conservation of vulnerable flora of alpine regions of the Himalaya, in the changing climate scenario.","[Verma, Anirudh; Chawla, Amit; Kumar, Amit] CSIR Inst Himalayan Bioresource Technol, Environm Technol Div, Palampur, Himachal Prades, India; [Singh, Chandra Prakash] Indian Space Res Org ISRO, Space Applicat Ctr, AED, BPSG,EPSA, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India",,"Kumar, A (corresponding author), CSIR Inst Himalayan Bioresource Technol, Environm Technol Div, Palampur, Himachal Prades, India.",anirudhverma44@gmail.com; amitchawla@ihbt.res.in; cpsingh@sac.isro.gov.in; amitkr@ihbt.res.in,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2023,32.0,7,,,,,2425,2449,,10.1007/s10531-023-02611-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-023-02611-0,,MAY 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000979248400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The scale of change in the district's climate was analyzed using meteorological station data (1901-2000) and grid data (1985-2015). Perceptions of climate change among forest-dependent communities in three altitude zones (< 1200 m asl (zone A); 1200-1800 m asl (zone B), and > 1800 m asl (zone C)) in the study region were surveyed with respect to 14 climate-specific indicators. Annual mean, maximum, and minimum temperature of seasonal data indicated increasing trends except monsoon. Percentage cloud cover showed an increase, of approximately 3%, while diurnal temperature displayed decreasing trends. Rainfall in the district showed a decreasing trend, with more than 50% of years 1985-2015 receiving less rainfall than the annual average. More than 90% of respondents in zones A and B, and around 65-70% respondents in zone C, reported changes in climate parameters. These findings confirm the long-term observable changes in climate in the region and demonstrate the utility of station data, grid data, and surveys of local communities' perceptions when analyzing climate change. The analysis provided important clues about the nature of climate changes in the district. The results can be used to reduce the gap between bottom-up understanding and top-down policies and to formulate precautionary and ongoing site-specific adaptation practices for communities in different altitude zones in the study region, leading to effective and efficient mitigation of climate change impacts.","[Jha, Shashidhar Kumar; Negi, A.

Previous studies seldom involved research on the influence of excess topography on the occurrences of coseismic landslides. The Iburi earthquake, which occurred in Japan on 6 September 2018 and triggered a large number of landslides, provided a research example to explore the relationship between coseismic landslides and excess topography. We used the average slope of the lithology as the threshold slope of the corresponding stratum to calculate the excess topography of the different lithological units. Based on the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) digital elevation model (DEM) with a resolution of 30 m, a quantitative analysis was conducted on the excess topography in the study area. The results indicate that the excess topography in the study area was mainly distributed in the valleys on both sides of the river, and the thickness of the excess topography on the high and steep ridges was generally greater than that at the foot of the slope, which has a relatively flat topography or a low elevation. In the area affected by the earthquake, approximately 94.66% of the coseismic landslides (with an area of approximately 28.23 m2) developed in the excess topography area, indicating that the distribution of the excess topography had a strong controlling influence on the spatial distribution of the coseismic landslides. The Iburi earthquake mainly induced shallow landslides, but the thickness of the landslide body was much smaller than the excess topography height in the landslides-affected area. This may imply that the excess topography was not completely removed by the coseismic landslides, and the areas where the earthquake landslides occurred still have the possibility of producing landslides in the future.","[Zhang, Pengfei; Qiu, Hengzhi; Chen, Xiaoli; Zhou, Qing] China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Pengfei; Qiu, Hengzhi; Chen, Xiaoli; Zhou, Qing] China Earthquake Adm, Key Lab Seism & Volcan Hazards, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chong] Minist Emergency Management China, Natl Inst Nat Hazards, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Chong] Minist Emergency Management China, Key Lab Cpd & Chained Nat Hazards Dynam, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",,"Chen, XL (corresponding author), China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geol, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.;Chen, XL (corresponding author), China Earthquake Adm, Key Lab Seism & Volcan Hazards, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",zhangpengfei@ies.ac.cn; qiuhengzhi@ies.ac.cn; chongxu@ninhm.ac.cn; chenxl@ies.ac.cn; zhouqing@ies.ac.cn,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2023,15.0,20,,,,,,,5035,10.3390/rs15205035,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15205035,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001093957800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Alongside, mountains are also exposed to atmospheric interactions and rainfall plays an important role in land movement activities through seepage of rainwater in fragile structures. Moreover, gravity pushing along with land use and climate change induced changing rainfall patterns and modification of slope lead to several hazards in mountainous regions. Environmental degradation in terms of soil erosion, loss of forests, and agricultural products are common phenomena in mountainous regions due to various multi-hazard threats. Therefore, it is necessary to conserve and management of our mountain environments as it is essential to the survival of the global ecosystem. Thus, the current research article focused on multi-hazard susceptibility mapping and evaluation of its risk assessment in some of the famous cultural heritage sites in the eastern Himalayan region of Sikkim state, India. Multi-hazard susceptibility mapping was carried out using boosted regression tree (BRT), Bayesian additive regression tree (BART) and Bayesian generalized linear model (BGLM) considering twenty-two conditioning factors and seismic activity, as this region is highly susceptible to earthquakes. The future climate and land use change were estimated using four representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and Dynamic Conversion of Land-Use and its Effects (Dyna-CLUE) model respectively to identify future multi-hazard susceptibility areas and vulnerable cultural heritage sites. The novelty of this study is to a combination of machine learning, RCPs derived future climate and Dyna-CLUE induced future land use change estimation for multi-hazard modelling and identification of vulnerable cultural heritage sites. The result of this study will help land use planners and archaeologists to adopt proper management strategies for protecting the cultural heritage sites and maintaining environmental sustainability for the proper management of mountain resources.","[Saha, Asish; Pal, Subodh Chandra; Chowdhuri, Indrajit; Roy, Paramita; Chakrabortty, Rabin] Univ Burdwan, Dept Geog, Bardhaman, W Bengal, India; [Santosh, M.] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Santosh, M.] Univ Adelaide, Dept Earth Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Janizadeh, Saeid] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Marine Sci, Dept Watershed Management Engn & Sci, Tehran 14115111, Iran; [Norouzi, Akbar] Shahrekord Univ, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Dept Nat Engn, Shahrekord, Iran; [Norouzi, Akbar] East Azarbaijan Reg Water Co, Expert Water Resource Khoda Afarin Cty, Tabriz, Iran",,"Pal, SC (corresponding author), Univ Burdwan, Dept Geog, Bardhaman, W Bengal, India.",geo.subodh@gmail.com,,,,,,,,55.0,55.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 20,2021,320.0,,,,,,,,128713,10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128713,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.128713,,SEP 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000716450400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We used in particular multi-temporal stereo satellite imagery, including high-resolution 1960/70s Corona and Hexagon spy images and contemporary Pleiades data.

The mass loss has been primarily driven by an increase in summer temperature and is further accelerated by proglacial lakes, which have become abundant. The glacial lake area more than doubled between 1964 and 2017. The termini of glaciers that flow into lakes moved on average twice as fast as glaciers terminating on land, indicating that dynamical thinning plays an important role.

The present study aims to study the summer range habitat suitability of this important Himalayan ungulate in Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS) of Western Himalaya, India. The study integrated ground presence point locations of the species with satellite data-derived variables in a binomial multiple logistic regression (BMLR) model to analyse its suitability status in KWS. Moist temperate forest (323.38 km(2)) was found to be the dominant vegetation type, followed by sub-alpine forest (128.24 km(2)) and alpine pasture (119.51 km(2)) in KWS. It was found that 7.39% (72.04 km(2)) of the study area is highly suitable, followed by 14.73% (143.68 km(2)), 13.43% (131.02 km(2)) and 64.44% (628.46 km(2)) area as suitable, moderately suitable and least suitable, respectively, for the species. The results also revealed that 71.59% (51.57 km(2)) of the highly suitable habitat occurs in sub-alpine forest, 18.41% (13.26 km(2)) in alpine pasture and 5.63% (4.06 km(2)) in alpine scrub. It was found that the vegetation type/land use was the most significant variable for habitat suitability assessment of the Himalayan musk deer in KWS. The BMLR model could successfully predict the potential summer range habitat of the species (Relative Operating Characteristics curve = 0.85). The findings of this study could be of immense use in the management of this Wildlife Sanctuary for better protection and conservation of the Himalayan musk deer.","[Nandy, Subrata; Kushwaha, S. P.

The researches on plant invasion have grown rapidly across the globe since the mid-twentieth century. However, in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) such studies are inadequate and have not been systematically conducted. Lack of empirical evidences on various described aspects of plant invasion in IHR are likely to aggravate the issue of invasion management in the region. This scenario would become more worst under changing climate. This study analyzed the results of an extensive review of the available information generated through Web of Science and Google scholar. A total of 297 naturalized alien plant species belongs to 65 families in the IHR are reported. Of the total 297 naturalized alien plant species in IHR, maximum species occur in Himachal Pradesh (232; 78.1%) followed by Jammu & Kashmir (192; 64.6%) and Uttarakhand (181; 60.90%). Among various invasive species, Lantana camara, Ageratina adenophora, Parthenium hysterophorus and Ageratum conyzoides have been reported from most of the IHR states and proliferated over larger area. Evidences available in the published studies are indicative that with tourism promotion and increasing roads networks, that passes through forests, many of the alien species in the IHR have started invading forests and even in alpine ecosystems. This study observed expansion of Ageratina adenophora up to 2900 m, which is higher than its reported elevation range (300-2800 m) in west Himalaya. These evidences suggest possible encroachment by alien species in hitherto invasion resilient higher Himalaya, particularly with emerging trends of increasing temperature and human disturbances. The present study also provides a multistage framework for investment on invasion researches in IHR. This will allow developing appropriate management strategies and policy planning for addressing issues pertaining to plant invasions across the IHR states.","[Pathak, Ravi; Negi, Vikram S.; Rawal, Ranbeer S.; Bhatt, Indra D.] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Ctr Biodivers Conservat & Management, Almora, Uttarakhand, India",,"Negi, VS (corresponding author), GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Ctr Biodivers Conservat & Management, Almora, Uttarakhand, India.",vikramsnegii@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,,45.0,54.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2019,28.0,12,,,,,3073,3102,,10.1007/s10531-019-01829-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-019-01829-1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000486211000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Geologically the landslide belongs to the Higher Himalaya and consists of Pre-Cambrian biotite-garnet and sillimanite gneiss with some quartzite. The present paper aims at describing various degrees of rock weathering and their effect in Sangrumba landslide. Field study followed by mineralogical, geochemical and geotechnical analyses of the collected rock and soil samples from the landslide zone were used in characterizing weathering degree. The gneisses are intensely weathered while quartzite is unweathered. Petrographical and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the rocks in the landslide zone had undergone weathering process with the formation of different types of clay minerals as kaolinite, vermiculite, smectite and chlorite. This was further confirmed by the Scan Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray analyses. These clay minerals drastically reduced the rock strength facilitating the extensive failure of the Sangrumba landslide. The major and trace element composition of the rock and soil samples was calculated from the XRF analyses. The geochemical analyses and weathering indexes of rocks showed that they are significantly weathered and had a major influence in the formation of the Sangrumba landslide. In addition, mechanical strength measurement of rock/soil showed that the strength drastically decreases as the weathering intensity increases. Rainfall followed by the rock type are the most dominant parameters influencing the weathering process which leads to the formation of large landslide as the present one.

Ensemble modeling reveals climate-driven high-altitude squeeze for the vulnerable snow trout Schizothorax richardsonii in Himalaya,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Mountain systems throughout the globe are conspicuously sensitive to on-going climate alterations. This condition is much more detrimental in the Himalaya, where the rate of warming and thus the glacier meltdown is much higher than elsewhere. The Himalayan coldwater species are concerningly most vulnerable to these changes because of their limited thermal range. Whilst climate studies strongly prognosticate the altered distribution of plants and mammals in this region, the impact on coldwater fishes still remains unknown. We used snow trout (Schizothorax richardsonii), a Himalayan coldwater specialist as a model organism to predict the current suitability and climate-driven potential range shift in an ensemble-based modeling framework. We collated occurrence data from a long term, extensive field-based sampling with additional records derived from an in-depth literature survey. A comprehensive input data set including topographic, hydrogeomorphic and climatic variables were used to build correlative species distribution models for the current and future time-periods (2050 and 2070) under three-carbon emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways) by integrating five General Circulation Models. Furthermore, we predicted the elevation-specific range shifts of the snow trout in response to climate change. We predict that a wide-ranging mid-elevation river network is currently suitable for the snow trout in Himalaya, however a significant part of its current distributional range would be lost over time. Our results highlight that snow trout would expand their range upwards into the high-altitude streams with a concurrent predominant range contraction in most of their lagging edges, ultimately creating a high-altitude squeeze. The net habitat loss under three RCP scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) was estimated to range from 7.41% to 16.29% for the year 2050 which would further increase in the year 2070 ranging from 9.46% to 26.56%. These results provide a strategic information on prioritizing climate-adaptive actions to target the currently suitable habitats and future refugia identified. Our modeling framework also provides a foremost basis to conserve not only the snow trout but also to evaluate the climate impact on several other coldwater species, which are equally vulnerable and ecologically important in the Himalaya.","[Sharma, Aashna; Dubey, Vineet Kumar; Johnson, Jeyaraj Antony; Sivakumar, Kuppusamy] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Rawal, Yogesh Kumar] Panjab Univ, Dept Zool, Chandigarh 160014, India",,"Sivakumar, K (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India.",ksivakumar@wii.gov.in,,,,,,,,31.0,33.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2021,120.0,,,,,,,,106900,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106900,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106900,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000591908400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A provisional expansion of the lake observed in 2004, from which some studies concluded an accelerated lake expansion due to global warming, has, from 2005, subsided to the glacier surface. Bathymetric changes for the period 1992-2002 that were first obtained for Himalayan glacial lakes suggest that the melting of debris-covered ice beneath the lake is insignificant in terms of the increase in lake volume, and that the retreat of a glacier in contact with the lake by calving is essential for the lake's expansion. Changes in the height of a damming moraine for the period 2001-2007 suggest a continuous surface lowering near the lake, though the lowering rates are smaller than those for the period 1989-1994.","[Fujita, Koji; Sakai, Akiko; Nuimura, Takayuki] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Satoru] Natl Res Inst Earth Sci & Disaster Prevent, Snow & Ice Res Ctr, Nagaoka, Niigata 9400821, Japan; [Sharma, Rishi R.] Minist Environm Sci & Technol, Dept Hydrol & Meteorol, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Fujita, K (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",,,,,,,,,118.0,126.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT-DEC,2009,4.0,4,,,,,,,45205,10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045205,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/4/4/045205,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000272900500062,View Full Record in Web of Science

The geology and geomorphology also play an important role and constitute the major predisposing factor controlling landslides. Additionally, active tectonics modify the landscape, impacting the occurrence and distribution of landslides. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of some of the major predisposing factors to assess landslide patterns in the Yamuna River Basin as it is prone to recurrent landslide hazards. The approach mainly deals with the application of geographical information system-based statistical analysis and quantifying frequency-area distribution of rainfall-triggered landslides for the years 2015 to 2017. The analysis shows that the frequency of landslides is highest in the slope range 40 degrees-70 degrees and the mean landslide size is higher in the slope range 0 degrees-20 degrees and 30 degrees-40 degrees, remaining constant on further increase in slope angle. The study shows that some critical slope range controls both the frequency and size of landslides. Landslides were mostly restricted to south facing slopes. About 91% of the landslide occur in the drainage density range of 1.2 to 2.1 km/km(2) while landslides show very low occurrence in either lower (<1.2) or higher (>2.1) drainage density. Frequency-size distribution analysis of landslides depicts a distinct cutoff point but an indistinct rollover point. Under-sampling of small landslides can be a reasonable cause for this. Like other studies, the present data fits very well for medium and large landslides following an inverse power law with a scaling exponent of -2.16. Around 80% of landslides are smaller than the cutoff size and 20% larger than this value. The geology and tectonics of Lesser Himalayas and Sivaliks offer favorable conditions for frequent landslides. Areas such as Dehradun, Uttarkashi, Sirmaur, Shimla, and Solan are very prone to landslide activity owing to the presence of poorly consolidated sandstone, conglomerate, quartzites, phyllites, etc. Moreover, the majority of larger landslides are in the Dehradun district where precipitation, drainage density, and lithology are highly favorable to trigger large events. The present study has identified the critical range of predisposing factors responsible for landslides and presents the frequency-size distribution of landslides in the Yamuna River Basin. These are the key inputs in landslide susceptibility mapping and risk assessment. Therefore, the findings from the present analysis can be very helpful in landslide risk reduction and landslide hazard zonation and probably plan critical locations for installation of early warning signals.","[Shankar, Ravi; Paswan, Ranjit Kumar] CSIR, REED, Cent Inst Min & Fuel Res, Dhanbad 826001, Bihar, India; [Satyam, Gyan Prakash] ISM, Dept Appl Geol, Indian Inst Technol, Dhanbad 826004, Bihar, India; [Singh, Prakash Kumar; Rai, Nilesh Kumar] Univ Allahabad, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Prayagraj 211002, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Satyam, GP (corresponding author), ISM, Dept Appl Geol, Indian Inst Technol, Dhanbad 826004, Bihar, India.",drravishankar3011@gmail.com; gyanpsatyam@gmail.com; psingh.geo@gmail.com; rainileshau@gmail.com; ranjitkumar.rainis@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,19.0,8,,,,,2374,2396,,10.1007/s11629-021-7081-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-021-7081-z,,JUL 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000832479700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Growing population pressure, intensified use of watershed resources, and development activities-often alleged injudicious, have brought resource productivity and availability to the edge of unsustainability. The threat to precarious ecological balance, sustainable livelihood, and disaster risk is underpinning issues of densely populated Himalayan watersheds. Hence, understanding the essential physical characteristics of watersheds vis-a-vis human dimensions is essential for assessing and prioritizing the watersheds intended for ecological restoration, landslide and erosion control, and disaster risk reduction in upstream and downstream zones. Following these issues, this study using a geographical approach examines watershed variables representing susceptibility, hydrological and geomorphic response, land use, and human pressure to assess sub-watershed conditions and prioritize sub-watersheds. The study used high-resolution satellite imageries, digital elevation model, topographic and geological maps, rainfall and socioeconomic data from government sources to obtain the watershed variables. These variables were analyzed in the GIS platform. The leading variables and their relative importance were identified for assessing the watershed conditions by analyzing the correlation matrix, and AHP supported the expert judgment. These variables are mean basin slope, lineament density, drainage density, landslides, population density, and non-forest-forest ratio. The sub-watersheds condition of the Syangja District was assessed. The calculated overall vulnerability of sub-watersheds is positively related to susceptibility, poor land management, and human pressure index.

In this study, we used a combination of species distribution modelling (SDM) and spatial hierarchical systematic conservation planning technique to delineate and prioritize areas for endemic plant species conservation under current and future (2050s, 2070s) climate conditions in Sikkim Himalaya. Data on endemic plant species occurrence were sourced from our already published studies and their potential suitable habitats under current and future climates were modelled using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) SDM. The MaxEnt habitat suitability projections of species were used in Zonation software to identify priority conservation areas in Sikkim Himalaya. We found that the existing PA network in the region was inadequate in conserving the endemic plant diversity either in the current or future climate scenarios. Based on our results, we propose addition of 896 square kilometres (sq km) to the existing PA network in the study area to ensure meaningful conservation goals. Additionally, we propose creation of 3 new PM (Yumsedong, Lachen and Chungthang) and the need for expanding the boundaries of existing PM (Maenam, Fambong Lho and Barsey) in the study area. Our analyses show that to mitigate the effects of ensuing climate change, a single large PA with wide geographic and elevational extents instead of several smaller PM would be a more prudent strategy for conserving the plant diversity in the Himalaya.","[Manish, Kumar; Pandit, Maharaj K.] Univ Delhi, Dept Environm Studies, Delhi 110007, India; [Manish, Kumar; Pandit, Maharaj K.] Univ Delhi, Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies Mt & Hill Environm, Delhi 110007, India; [Manish, Kumar] Univ Delhi, Dr BR Ambedkar Coll, Dept Environm Studies, Delhi 110094, India",,"Pandit, MK (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Dept Environm Studies, Delhi 110007, India.",rajkpandit@gmail.com,,,,,,,,19.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2019,233.0,,,,,,176,184,,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.02.036,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.02.036,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000467513500018,View Full Record in Web of Science

In India, significant damages due to earthquake induced landslides have been reported in the Himalayan region and also in the Western Ghat region. Thus there is a requirement of a quantitative macro-level landslide hazard assessment within the Indian subcontinent in order to identify the regions with high hazard. In the present study, the seismic landslide hazard for the entire state of Karnataka, India was assessed using topographic slope map, derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. The available ASTER DEM data, resampled to 50 m resolution, was used for deriving the slope map of the entire state. Considering linear source model, deterministic seismic hazard analysis was carried out to estimate peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) at bedrock, for each of the grid points having terrain angle 10A degrees and above. The surface level PHA was estimated using nonlinear site amplification technique, considering B-type NEHRP site class. Based on the surface level PHA and slope angle, the seismic landslide hazard for each grid point was estimated in terms of the static factor of safety required to resist landslide, using Newmark's analysis. The analysis was carried out at the district level and the landslide hazard map for all the districts in the Karnataka state was developed first. These were then merged together to obtain a quantitative seismic landslide hazard map of the entire state of Karnataka. Spatial variations in the landslide hazard for all districts as well as for the entire state Karnataka is presented in this paper. The present study shows that the Western Ghat region of the Karnataka state is found to have high landslide hazard where the static factor of safety required to resist landslide is very high.","[James, Naveen; Sitharam, T.

Intensified floods, accelerating glacial retreat, rapid permafrost degradation, and prolonged droughts are altering the natural hydrological balances and generating unpredictable spatial and temporal distributions of water availability. Anthropogenic activities are adding further pressure onto Himalayan waterways. The fundamental question of waterway management in this region is therefore how this hydro-meteorological transformation, caused by climate change and anthropogenic perturbations, can be tackled to find avenues for sustainability. This requires a framework that can diagnose threats at a range of spatial and temporal scales and provide recommendations for strong adaptive measures for sustainable future waterways. This focus paper assesses the current literature base to bring together our understanding of how recent climatic changes have threatened waterways in the Asian Himalayas, how society has been responding to rapidly changing waterway conditions, and what adaptive options are available for the region. The study finds that Himalayan waterways are crucial in protecting nature and society. The implementation of integrated waterways management measures, the rapid advancement of waterway infrastructure technologies, and the improved governance of waterways are more critical than ever.This article is categorized under:Engineering Water > Sustainable Engineering of Water","[Kattel, Giri R.] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Kattel, Giri R.; Wu, Wenyan] Univ Melbourne, Dept Infrastructure, Parkville, Australia; [Kattel, Giri R.] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Paszkowski, Amelie] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford, England; [Pokhrel, Yadu] Michigan State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, E Lansing, MI USA; [Li, Dongfeng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Kent Ridge, Singapore, Singapore; [Li, Dongfeng] Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, Key Lab Water & Sediment Sci, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Rao, Mukund P.

We assessed the environmental vulnerability of the eco-development zone of GHNP using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies. To quantify the environmental vulnerability, a numerical model using spatial principal component ahalysis (SPCA) was developed. This model considered five factors: land use/land cover, forest canopy density, forest fire risk, landslide susceptibility and human population density. The environmental vulnerability integrated index (EVSI) calculated for the 1990, 2000 and 2010 periods was found to be 2.00, 2.72, and 3.40, respectively. The results showed temporal increase in the environmental vulnerability in the zone. Based on the numerical outputs, the vulnerability of the region was categorized into five classes: potential, slight, medium, high, and severe. The primary factor responsible for the increase in vulnerability overtime was land use/land cover change in the study area due to hydro-electric power projects, construction of roads, and other infrastructure developments. Forest fire and decreased forest canopy density are other major contributing factors responsible for the increase in the environmental vulnerability. Our results indicated that integration of RS, GIS and SPCA can effectively quantify and assess environmental vulnerability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Among bear species, the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) has a distribution that is restricted to Himalayan highlands with relatively small and fragmented populations. To date, very little scientific information on the Himalayan brown bear, which is vital for the conservation of the species and the management of its habitats, especially in protected areas of the landscape, is available. The present study aims to understand the effectiveness of existing Himalayan Protected Areas in terms of representativeness for the conservation of Himalayan brown bear (HBB), an umbrella species in high-altitude habitats of the Himalayan region. We used the ensemble approach of the species distribution model and then assessed biological connectivity to predict the current and future distribution and movement of HBB in climate change scenarios for the year 2050. Approximately 33 protected areas (PAs) currently possess suitable habitats. Our model suggests a massive decline of approximately 73.38% and 72.87% under 4.5 and 8.5 representative concentration pathway (RCP) respectively in the year 2050 compared with the current distribution. The predicted change in suitability will result in loss of habitats from thirteen PAs; eight will become completely uninhabitable by the year 2050, followed by loss of connectivity in the majority of PAs. Habitat configuration analysis suggested a 40% decline in the number of suitable patches, a reduction in large habitat patches (up to 50%) and aggregation of suitable areas (9%) by 2050, indicating fragmentation. The predicted change in geographic isotherm will result in loss of habitats from thirteen PAs, eight of them will become completely inhabitable. Hence, these PAs may lose their effectiveness and representativeness in achieving the very objective of their existence or conservation goals. Therefore, we recommend adaptive spatial planning for protecting suitable habitats distributed outside the PA for climate change adaptation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The livelihoods of communities in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region are closely linked with the cryosphere. But over the past few decades, communities in the region have experienced multiple changes, including those driven by climat e change, with direct and immediate impacts on their lives and livelihoods. In this study, we explore linkages between the cryosphere and high-mountain livelihoods using a social-ecological system approach. It examines how the complex social-ecological system in villages in Langtang Valley, Nepal, has evolved in response to both cryospheric and socioeconomic changes. The local communities perceive gradual but significant changes in the cryospheric system, such as receding and thinning glaciers, changing snowfall patterns, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, and a growing incidence of cryosphere-related hazards, such as avalanches and landslides. Communities in the Langtang Valley are also facing a number of socioeconomic changes, resulting in changing aspirations, particularly among the youth. The growing disconnection between society and the surrounding cryosphere, with direct impacts on the transfer and growth of local knowledge systems, are discussed. These simultaneous changes in the cryosphere and the socioeconomic domain have also resulted in a homogenization of livelihood sources, with tourism emerging as the dominant source of livelihood. This has resulted in a dependence of the local population on food imported from outside the valley. A growing dependence on tourism for livelihoods, dependence on imports for food and other basic needs, and the lack of a risk reduction strategy might pose great risks for local lives and livelihoods in the long run. Interventions pertaining to diversifying livelihoods, harmonizing social capital, and hazard risk assessment are essential for strengthening linkages between cryosphere and the socioeconomic system.","[Tuladhar, Sabarnee; Pasakhala, Binaya; Maharjan, Amina; Mishra, Arabinda] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu 44703, Nepal",,"Tuladhar, S (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu 44703, Nepal.",sabarnee.tuladhar@icimod.org,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,12.0,1,,,SI,,119,131,,10.1016/j.accre.2020.12.004,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.accre.2020.12.004,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000629700700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many barriers have formed as a result of the earthquake and secondary disasters, such as landslides, which have blocked the river. The breach of the barrier lake seriously threatens the lives and property safety of downstream personnel. There has been little research on the surrounding ecology for the later treatment of the barrier lake. This paper aims to scientifically predict the risk of dam break in a barrier lake as well as to explore its impact on the ecological environment and put forward controllable measures. Based on four major barrier lake events in the Sichuan-Tibet area, Diexihaizi, Tangjiashan barrier lake, and so on, we extract water bodies from remote sensing images and use the HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center of River Analysis System) model to investigate whether there is a dam break risk and the route of the dam break is predictable. Simultaneously, from 1990 to 2020, the smallest administrative region is located. The InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model is utilized to evaluate and analyze its habitat and create an evaluation based on flood inundation data. The results suggest that a stable barrier lake (such as Diexihaizi) has a sound effect on the habitat quality index following engineering treatment. The development of the barrier lake has altered the types of neighboring lands used and the natural patterns of the region's landscape. The habitat quality index will marginally deteriorate within a 1-km radius of the barrier lake. However, the quality of habitats in the area ranging within 3 km and 5 km has improved. It is necessary to discharge and strengthen the barrier lake artificially. Human-controlled regions, according to studies, will recover higher habitat quality index values than other locations. Whether the barrier lake has a positive impact on the surrounding area, on the other hand, is primarily dependent on the original ecology. The development of barrier lakes is damaging and unprofitable in Tibet, where the actual ecology is better in the short term. Still, in Sichuan Province, where the habitat quality is relatively low, the appearance of dammed lakes has played a role in correcting the ecology.","[Jiang, Fengshan; Xie, Zhiqiang; Xu, Tong] Yunnan Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Kunming 650504, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Fengshan; Dai, Xiaoai; Qu, Ge; Hou, Zhiqun] Chengdu Univ Technol, Sch Earth Sci, Chengdu 610051, Peoples R China; [Xie, Zhiqiang; Yin, Siqiao; Yang, Shouquan; Zhang, Yangbin; Yang, Zhibing; Xu, Jiarui] Yunnan Univ, Inst Int Rivers & Ecosecur, Kunming 650504, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Hou, Zhiqun] Kunming Inst Surveying & Mapping, Kunming 650504, Yunnan, Peoples R China",,"Dai, XA (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Sch Earth Sci, Chengdu 610051, Peoples R China.",daixiaoai@163.com,,,,,,,,5.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,29.0,47,,,,,71290,71310,,10.1007/s11356-022-20866-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20866-y,,MAY 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000798404700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this, respondent surveys (household, n = 430; individual interviews,n = 240) were carried out and the collected data were subjected to statistical analyses. The study also validated the perception ofBhangalisusing the available weather data (1974-2017) through the Mann-Kendall test. The results reveal thatBhangalisperceived 11 indicators of changing climate, of which decrease in snowfall was the most prominent (reported by similar to 97% of the respondents). The perceptions varied between the two genders with males having significantly higher proportion of responses for all the 11 indicators. Similarly, differences in perception among the age groups were also observed, elderly people reported higher proportion of climate change indicators as compared to respondents of lower age. Notably, patterns of temperature and rainfall perceptions by theBhangalisagreed with the trends of meteorological data.

Parthenium hysterophorus (Congress grass), native to tropical America, is one of the world's worst weeds with huge ecological and economic impacts, including in India. Here we report the current and future potential distribution of P. hysterophorus in India under climate change scenarios and describe its niche dynamics. The results revealed that under current climate, 65% of the total area in India is suitable for its potential invasion with three invasion hotspots identified: Western Himalaya, North-East and parts of Peninsular India. The study predicts an overall decrease in habitat suitability for this invasive species under climate change with about half of the suitable habitat reduced under RCP 8.5-2070; but some of the currently invaded regions will remain equally (North-East) or become highly vulnerable (Western Himalaya) to its invasion under future climate. Interestingly, niche dynamics results revealed that P. hysterophorus has shifted its climatic niche in the invaded range in India, more due to niche unfilling. Based on univariate analysis, niche dynamic processes in the analogous (expansion) and non-analogous (abandonment and pioneering) environments were also evident. The results from present study can help in developing climate change-integrated and region-specific invasion management strategies in India. More importantly, results of niche dynamics between native and invaded ranges of P. hysterophorus offer novel insights to understand the nature of niche shifts in invasive species and to predict the invasion potential under climate change.","[Ahmad, Rameez; Khuroo, Anzar A.; Hamid, Maroof] Univ Kashmir, Ctr Biodivers & Taxon, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Charles, Bipin] ATREE, Jakkur PO, Bengaluru 560064, India; [Rashid, Irfan] Univ Kashmir, Biol Invas Lab, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Ahmad, R (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Ctr Biodivers & Taxon, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",rameezkhuroo929@gmail.com,,,,,,,,51.0,56.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2019,28.0,8-9,,,SI,,2319,2344,,10.1007/s10531-019-01775-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-019-01775-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000470665000021,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, over the past decade, management activities around these sites have lagged due, in part, to limited baselines on their historical ecology and hydrologic dynamics. This article advances Himalayan wetland studies by reviewing available data from Khecheopalri, a temperate peatland located in the Sikkim Eastern Himalayas. Formed after the Last Glacial Maximum, Khecheopalri contains distinctive ecological assemblages as well as a central waterbody considered sacred to Indigenous and local groups. Environmental organizations have collaborated with cultural institutions to conserve these natural resources. Nevertheless, significant anthropogenic changes have continued at Khecheopalri since the late 1980s. By reviewing these developments, this article establishes baselines for future management activities at this peatland.

Since precipitation and temperature are the major driving factors of water resources in the Himalayas both upstream and downstream regions, it is important to understand theimpacts of climate change in water resource availability in the future. In this study, we analyzed the historical hydro-climate data and developed a suitable ensemble of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) climate models for the Karnali River Basin (KRB) in western Nepal and assessed the future water availability in different climate scenarios using a semi-distributed catchment scale hydrological model the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The climate data analysis shows that the atmospheric temperature is rising throughout the basin but there is high spatial variability in precipitation trend. The historical river discharge data analysis do not show any significant trend, however, there is some inter-annual variability. Future projection shows that the annual precipitation amount will increase compared to the baseline so does the river discharge. However, this increase is not uniform for all seasons. The post-monsoon season having the lowest observed precipitation will get lesser amount of precipitation in the future and the river discharge also follows the same trend. These anomalies play a crucial role in determining the future water availability for agriculture, hydropower, ecosystem functioning and its services availability to the people living in the KRB as well as in the downstream region.","[Dahal, Piyush; Shrestha, Madan Lall; Panthi, Jeeban; Pradhananga, Dhiraj] Small Earth Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Shrestha, Madan Lall] Nepal Acad Sci & Technol, Patan, Nepal; [Panthi, Jeeban] Univ Rhode Isl, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Pradhananga, Dhiraj] Tribhuvan Univ, Kirtipur, Nepal; [Pradhananga, Dhiraj] Univ Saskatchewan, Ctr Hydrol, Saskatoon, SK, Canada",,"Dahal, P (corresponding author), Small Earth Nepal, Kathmandu, Nepal.",piyush@smallearth.org.np,,,,,,,,50.0,50.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2020,185.0,,,,,,,,109430,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109430,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109430,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000530034100057,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been documented that the rates of warming in the HKH region are significantly higher than the global average and that the warming is occurring at much higher rates in the high-altitude regions than in the low-altitude regions. Mountainous environments are considered sensitive indicators of climate change. Hence this study examined the potential impact of global warming on the HKH region by applying Hadley Centre's high-resolution regional climate model PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies) to 3 subregions: the western, central, and eastern Himalaya. The physical mechanisms that drive warming are different for the 3 regions, and the western Himalaya has 2 major rainy seasons, whereas the central and eastern Himalaya have only one. This study therefore focused on the common rainy season (June-September), during which all 3 regions receive the highest proportion of their annual rainfall. The 3 PRECIS simulations that correspond to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's A1B emissions scenario were carried out for a continuous period from 1961 to 2098. They were validated with high-resolution (0.25 degrees latitude x 0.25 degrees longitude) data provided by the Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of the Water Resources (APHRODITE) project and by the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data. The model was reasonably effective in simulating the monsoon climate over the HKH region. The climate projections were examined over the short (2011-2040), medium (2041-2070), and long term (2071-2098). The model projections indicate that significant warming will occur throughout the HKH region toward the end of the 21st century. Summer monsoon precipitation is expected to be 20-40% higher in 2071-2098 than it was in the baseline period (1961-1990). The 3 Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Predictions simulations show large differences in projections in the western Himalaya.","[Kulkarni, Ashwini; Patwardhan, Savita; Kumar, K.

The study utilized multi-temporal Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 images accessible in the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform to analyse the spatiotemporal variations of the supraglacial lake (SGL) in the H-K regions from 1990 to 2020 at a decadal interval. It is observed that 61% (4.79 km2) of the SGL area increased from 1990 to 2020, while 223 new lakes formed in a similar time period. The most significant increase in the area of SGLs (30.15%; 2.93 km2) was observed between 2010 and 2020, while the slowest growth was observed between 1990 and 2000 (1.13%; 0.09 km2). The results indicate heterogeneity in SGL area changes in different regions. The region of Central Himalaya (CH) experienced the highest increase of 160% (3.8 km2) in the SGL area from 1990 to 2020 with most of the rise in the SGL area was observed in the Everest region, while a decrease of 9.4% (0.12 km2) was observed in the Eastern Himalaya (EH) region. During the study period, some SGLs converted into proglacial lakes in the EH region, which may be responsible for reducing the SGL area. The rise of SGL in the CH region can be attributed to higher mass loss, decreased glacier surface velocity, and increased rainfall in the CH region. We also identified 15 glaciers that have SGLs near the terminus of the glaciers. If the same trend continues, these SGLs may soon be converted into proglacial lakes. The current inventory of SGL at a decadal scale shall be useful as baseline data for other hydro-glaciological models.","[Sahu, Rakesh] Chandigarh Univ, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Mohali 140413, India; [Sahu, Rakesh; Ramsankaran, Raaj; Verma, Prateek] Indian Inst Technol, Remote Sensing Div, Dept Civil Engn, Hydroremote Sensing Applicat H RSA Grp, Mumbai, India; [Bhambri, Rakesh] Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Verma, Prateek] Datta Meghe Inst Higher Educ & Res, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Artificial intelligence & Machine Learning, Wardha 442001, Maharashtra, India; [Chand, Pritam] Cent Univ Punjab, Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Dept Geog, Bathinda 151401, Punjab, India",,"Sahu, R (corresponding author), Chandigarh Univ, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Mohali 140413, India.;Sahu, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Remote Sensing Div, Dept Civil Engn, Hydroremote Sensing Applicat H RSA Grp, Mumbai, India.",Rakeshsahu1609@gmail.com,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2023,51.0,12,,,,,2379,2390,,10.1007/s12524-023-01773-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-023-01773-2,,OCT 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001088215200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The suspended soils and turbidity are highly correlated and affect the water quality index (WQI). The WQI of headwater streams is good during low water flow seasons and poor during high water flow seasons. This is due to the number of melting glaciers and suspended solids/turbidity. Principal component analysis shows that in all the seasons, human activities such as road-cutting projects across the river and natural causes such as intense rainfall and melting of moraine-filled glaciers both impact the WQI.

The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), like many mountainous regions, is the site of multiple and overlapping natural hazards, but the distribution of multi-hazard risk and the populations exposed to it are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution transboundary models describing susceptibility to floods, landslides, and wildfires to understand population exposure to multi-hazard risk across the HKH. These models are created from historical remotely sensed data and hazard catalogs by the maximum entropy (Maxent) machine learning technique. Our results show that human settlements in the HKH are disproportionately concentrated in areas of high multi-hazard risk. In contrast, low-hazard areas are disproportionately unpopulated. Nearly half of the population in the region lives in areas that are highly susceptible to more than one hazard. Warm low-altitude foothill areas with perennially moist soils were identified as highly susceptible to multiple hazards. This area comprises only 31% of the study region, but is home to 49% of its population. The results also show that areas susceptible to multiple hazards are also major corridors of current migration and urban expansion, suggesting that current rates and patterns of urbanization will continue to put more people at risk. This study establishes that the population in the HKH is concentrated in areas susceptible to multiple hazards and suggests that current patterns of human movement will continue to increase exposure to multi-hazards in the HKH.

In order to clarify the differences of lake hydrochemistry of Tibetan Plateau, water samples were collected from 32 lakes, including 22 tectonic lakes and 11 glacial lakes, along the Tibetan Plateau road, from September to October 2016. We detected and analyzed the major ion concentrations and characteristics of samples, and discuss the hydrochemistry type, controlling factors, and major ion sources of lake water. The results showed that, firstly, tectonic lake samples on the Tibetan Plateau have much higher physicochemical parameters and ion contents than glacial lakes, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) contents fluctuate from high to low latitudes. The variations of ion concentrations in the northern part of the Qiagui Co were more fluctuating and have two obvious peaks, while the variations in the southern part were moderate. The TDS of glacial lakes were low and leveling off in the upper and middle reaches of the basin, while higher and more variable in the lower reaches. Secondly, the tectonic lakes were mainly chloride saline lakes, with Na+ as the major cation, and SO42-, Cl- as the major anions. Glacial lakes were mainly carbonate and sulfate type lakes, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were the major cations, HCO3- was the major anion, and SO42- was the second. Thirdly, the hydrochemistry processes of the tectonic lakes were mainly controlled by evaporation-crystallization, and the ions mainly came from the evaporites of basin.

Due to the impacts of climate change on precipitation patterns such as rise in rainfall intensity, reduction in its temporal spread, and a marked decline in winter rain, coupled with other anthropogenic causes, the problem of dying springs is being increasingly felt across this region. This study was taken up in the Sikkim Himalaya, which has received limited attention despite being a part of the Eastern Himalaya global biodiversity hot spot. The objective of this study was to understand the basic characteristics of the springs and to demonstrate methods for reviving them. We found the rural landscape dotted by a network of microsprings occurring largely in farmers' fields, with an average dependency of 27 (630) households per spring. The spring discharge generally showed an annual periodic rhythm suggesting a strong response to rainfall. The mean discharge of the springs was found to peak at 51 L/min during the postmonsoon months (September-November) and then diminish to 8 L/min during spring (March-May). The lean period (March-May) discharge is perceived to have declined by nearly 50% in drought-prone areas and by 35% in other areas over the last decade. The springshed development approach to revive 5 springs using rainwater harvesting and geohydrology techniques showed encouraging results, with the lean period discharge increasing substantially from 4.4 to 14.4 L/min in 2010-2011. The major challenges faced in springshed development were the following: identifying recharge areas accurately, developing local capacity, incentivizing rainwater harvesting in farmers' fields, and sourcing public financing. We recommend further action research studies to revive springs to advance the outcomes of this pilot study and mainstreaming of springshed development in watershed development, rural water supply, and climate change adaptation programs, especially in the Himalayan region.","[Tambe, Sandeep; Kharel, Ghanashyam; Ganeriwala, Anil K.] Gram Vikas Bhawan, Govt Sikkim, Dept Rural Management & Dev, Gangtok 737101, Sikkim, India; [Kulkarni, Himanshu; Mahamuni, Kaustubh] Lenyadri Soc, Adv Ctr Water Resources Dev & Management, Pune 411021, Maharashtra, India",,"Tambe, S (corresponding author), Gram Vikas Bhawan, Govt Sikkim, Dept Rural Management & Dev, Gangtok 737101, Sikkim, India.",sandeep_tambe@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,101.0,103.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2012,32.0,1,,,,,62,72,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00079.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00079.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000301505500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding the historical distribution of Cedrus and the driving factors can provide valuable information for the conservation of these species. In this study, we collected current distribution data and pollen fossil records for Cedrus. We used MaxEnt to simulate the distribution of Cedrus in the Mediterranean region and western Himalaya during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the middle Holocene (MH), present and future in response to different climate scenarios. Our simulation results indicate that winter precipitation is the key factor that determines the distribution of Cedrus, followed by winter temperature. The results also show that summer precipitation had a more important impact in the Mediterranean region than in the western Himalaya. The results indicate that climate change exerts a significant impact on the distribution of Cedrus in the Medi-terranean, but not as much as in the western Himalaya. This could be attributed to the greater availability of microclimates (climate niche space) in the latter region. The availability of microclimates associated with the complex topography in the western Himalaya. The simulated results are generally consistent with fossil data. In the Mediterranean region, the suitability of the habitats for Cedrus decreased continuously from the LGM to the year 2070, with a distinct drop from the LGM to the MH. In the western Himalaya, the potential suitability of habitats for Cedrus increased from the LGM to the MH, but might fluctuate in the future. In general, this study identifies the key climate factors restricting the natural distribution of Cedrus.

The Hydrologic Engineering Center-River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) model was used for flood simulation and mapping. The ALOS 12.5 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to extract river geometry, and the flows generated in these river basins using RCP scenarios were used as the inflow boundary condition. Severe flooding would inundate an area of ~66%, ~86%, ~37% (under mid-21st century), and an area of ~72%, ~93%, ~59% (under late 21st century RCP 8.5 scenario) in the Chitral, Hunza, and Astore river basins, respectively. There is an urgent need to develop a robust flood mitigation plan for the frequent floods occurring in northern Pakistan.","[Hayat, Huma; Khan, Romana; Tahir, Adnan Ahmad] COMSATS Univ Islamabad CUI, Dept Environm Sci, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad 22060, Pakistan; [Saifullah, Muhammad] Muhammad Nawaz Shareef Univ Agr, Dept Agr Engn, Multan 66000, Pakistan; [Ashraf, Muhammad] Khwaja Fareed Univ Engn & Technol KFUEIT, Dept Agr Engn, Rahim Yar Khan 64200, Pakistan; [Liu, Shiyin] Yunnan Univ, Inst Int Rivers & Ecosecur, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Muhammad, Sher] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu 44700, Nepal",,"Tahir, AA (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad CUI, Dept Environm Sci, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad 22060, Pakistan.;Liu, SY (corresponding author), Yunnan Univ, Inst Int Rivers & Ecosecur, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",huma_hayat57@hotmail.com; muhammad.saifullah@mnsuam.edu.pk; dr.ashraf@kfueit.edu.pk; shiyin.liu@ynu.edu.cn; Sher.Muhammad@icimod.org; romanakhan@cuiatd.edu.pk; Adnantahir@cuiatd.edu.pk,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2021,13.0,20,,,,,,,2806,10.3390/w13202806,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13202806,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000726430800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These transitions, which can have impacts on human health, are driven by state policies, a market economy, and climate change. Human health is dependent on access to ecosystem services for food, nutrition, medicine, fiber and shelter, fresh water, and clear air.

S.",,,An integrated approach for the identification and prioritization of areas based on their livelihood vulnerability index: a case study of agro-pastoral community from Western Indian Himalaya,MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Recent changes in climatic conditions are expected to intensify the existing risk of hunger and malnutrition along with the vulnerability of livelihood in the developing nations, more so on the fragile Hindu-Kush Himalaya. Many communities in this region subsist on agro-pastoral practices, which hinge upon seasonal rhythmic cooperative farming and traditional knowledge associated with these practices. With the rapid change in socio-cultural practices coupled with changing climate, agro-pastoral production has declined in many areas. Hill farming cannot resist even a small degree of disturbance as steep slopes and terrain conditions already limit hill agriculture's capacity. However, quantitative information in these aspects is lacking. Livelihood vulnerability assessment methods have emerged as an important tool for the identification of areas requiring immediate intervention. The different results from different methods make it difficult for policymakers to prioritize areas requiring direct intervention. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the livelihood vulnerability of an agro-pastoral community viz. Barpatiyas of the western (Indian) Himalayan region by two widespread methods and suggest an integrated approach for prioritization for interventions. The vulnerability assessment in the current study was broadly based on the IPCC's definition of vulnerability as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Of 832 households in 13 villages, 303 households were interviewed to assess their livelihood vulnerability due to climate change and its socio-cultural impact. Analysis of data reveals that the households located at lower altitudes are more at risk of vulnerability than settlements at higher altitudes in the Himalaya. The agro-pastoral-based livelihood was most vulnerable due to natural calamities, followed by water security, climatic stress and social networks. The observed patterns were complex and interlinked such as their remote habitations. A lack of linear infrastructure causes a high rate of out-migration, which further causes the loss of their traditional knowledge. High dependence of the community for livelihood on the climate-sensitive system such as agriculture and increased exposure to natural disasters is noticeable. Implications of the findings are discussed.","[Joshi, Naveen Chandra; Rawat, G.

Such assessments are critical in the Indus River basin (compared to the Ganga and Brahmaputra), which besides having a significant contribution from the glaciers, also exhibits considerable heterogeneity in glacier response. Thus, to quantify this variability in glacier behavior and thereby develop a comprehensive understanding of the past as well as the future evolution of the glaciers, we reconstruct the annual surface mass balance records of 75 glaciers (size >1 km(2)) in the Suru sub basin, western Himalaya for the period 1994-2018. We apply a remote sensing-based equilibrium line altitude-mass balance approach, supported by geodetic mass balance estimates (for 18 major glaciers) and limited field measurements. Our findings suggest a persistent negative mass balance of the glaciers (average: -0.69 +/- 0.28 m w.e.a(-1), cumulative:-16.56 m w.e), varying from -0.46 +/- 0.27 (1997) to -0.79 +/- 0.28 (2018) m w.e.a(-1) during the study period. This overall mass loss coincides with an increased temperature (T-avg increased 0.5 degrees C; T-min increased 0.27 degrees C; T-max increased 0.06 degrees C) and reduced precipitation (by 4%) in the valley during 1994-2018, which shows the sensitivity of these glaciers to climate change. Within the Suru sub-basin, smaller, cleaner and high-altitude mountain glaciers of the Ladakh range have experienced greater mass loss (cumulative: -20.88 m w.e) compared to the Greater Himalayan range (cumulative: -13.44 m w.e). We observe latitudinal variability in mass loss in the Western Himalaya, with the highest mass loss rates in the Greater Himalayan Range (>-0.9 m w.e.a(-1)) and lowest in the Karakoram Range (<-0.1 m w.e.a(-1)), suggesting a transitional response of the Suru sub-basin glaciers (-0.69 m w.e.a(-1)). The overall regional picture suggests synchronicity in the mass loss pattern of western Himalayan glaciers, predominantly controlled by the climatic conditions. Meanwhile, the variability in their mass loss rates is attributed to the unique glacier characteristics. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

An attempt has been made to study the seasonal and annual (October 2015 to September 2017) characteristics of air temperature, near-surface temperature lapse rate (tlr), in-situ glacier surface melting, and surface melt simulation by temperature-index (T-index) models for Sutri Dhaka Glacier catchment, Lahaul-Spiti region in Western Himalaya. The tlr of the catchment ranges from 0.3 to 6.5 degrees C km(-1), varying on a monthly and seasonal timescale, which suggests the need for avoiding the use of standard environmental lapse rate (SELR similar to 6.5 degrees C km(-1)). The measured and extrapolated average air temperature (tavg) was found to be positive on glacier surface (4500 to 5500 m asl) between June and September (summer). Ablation data calculated for the balance years 2015-16 and 2016-17 shows an average melting of -4.20 +/- 0.84 and -3.09 +/- 0.62 m w.e., respectively. In compliance with positive air temperature in summer, ablation was also found to be maximum similar to 88% of total yearly ice melt. When comparing the observed and modelled ablation data with air temperature, we show that the high summer glacier melt was caused by warmer summer air temperature and minimum spells of summer precipitation in the catchment.","[Pratap, Bhanu; Sharma, Parmanand; Patel, Lavkush; Singh, Ajit T.; Gaddam, Vinay Kumar; Oulkar, Sunil; Thamban, Meloth] ESSO, Natl Ctr Polar & Ocean Res, Headland Sada 403804, Vasco Da Gama, India; [Gaddam, Vinay Kumar] Dhanekula Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Vijayawada 521139, India",,"Pratap, B (corresponding author), ESSO, Natl Ctr Polar & Ocean Res, Headland Sada 403804, Vasco Da Gama, India.",bhanuglacio@gmail.com,,,,,,,,32.0,32.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019,11.0,8,,,,,,,1561,10.3390/w11081561,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11081561,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000484561500035,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, based upon minimal observations, numerous conclusions were made about glacier mass, length, and area loss, leading to the erroneous conclusion by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2007. At the same time, the results from a cryosphere programme of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) started to arrive, where satellite data of Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) 1C and 1D were analysed. The information helped to resolve IPCC controversy and provided invaluable insight into Himalayan cryosphere. New models, techniques, and methods were developed in the ISRO programme, providing information on the distribution of snow and glaciers, the formation of glacier lakes, glacier retreat, and mass loss. The information was unique and otherwise not available to the scientific community. The data were also extensively used for developmental activities and to assess national security. These include monitoring of snow in Ladakh, hydropower development in Himachal Pradesh, and risk assessment from glacier lakes in Uttarakhand.

In this study, we compiled the first complete rock glacier inventory for the Hunza Basin, western Karakoram, of 616 rock glaciers with an area of 194 km(2) between 2800 and 5700 ma.s.l. We categorized the rock glaciers as intact or relict, and their distributions and destabilization were further analyzed and used along with in situ climate and elevation dataset to model the permafrost probability distribution. The modeled areas where the permafrost zonation index (PZI) is 0.5-1.00 indicate that permafrost occurs over 85% of the catchment area and lies above 3525 ma.s.l., which closely matches the zero-degree isotherm of 3800 ma.s.l. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the independent variables, elevation is the most sensitive variable, followed by net radiation, for predicting the probabilities of the presence and absence of permafrost. The model distributions are quite precise, with median posterior areas under the curve of 0.98 and 0.96 for model training and testing, respectively. We analyzed the rock glacier destabilization for 68 rock glaciers that interacted with river channels, of which 50 blocked or diverted river channels. Destabilized rock glaciers can be closely linked to the 0 degrees C isotherm between 3400 and 4600 m a.s.l. The significant damage caused by periodic floods from the subsequent blockage of river channels by landslides can be attributed to variations in permafrost.

The combined assessment of spatial probability and the determination of earthquake risk at large scales is challenging. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there no updated earthquake-hazard-and-risk assessments for the Eurasia region have been published since 1999. Considering that Eurasia is characterized by a seismically active Alpine-Himalayan fault zone and the Pacific Ring of Fire, which are frequently affected by devastating events, a continental-scale risk assessment for Eurasia is necessary to check the global applicability of developed methods and to update the earthquake-hazard, -vulnerability, and -risk maps. The current study proposes an integrated deep-transfer-learning approach called the gated recurrent unit-simple recurrent unit (GRU-SRU) to estimate earthquake risk in Eurasia. In this regard, the GRU model estimates the spatial probability, while the SRU model evaluates the vulnerability. To this end, spatial probability assessment (SPA), and earthquake-vulnerability assessment (EVA) results were integrated to generate risk A, while the earthquake-hazard assessment (EHA) and EVA were considered to generate risk B. This research concludes that in the case of earthquake-risk assessment (ERA), the results obtained for Risk B were better than those for risk A. Using this approach, we also evaluated the stability of the factors and interpreted the interaction values to form a spatial prediction. The accuracy of our proposed integrated approach was examined by means of a comparison between the obtained deep learning (DL)-based results and the maps generated by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM). The accuracy of the SPA was 93.17%, while that of the EVA was 89.33%.","[Jena, Ratiranjan; Shanableh, Abdallah; Al-Ruzouq, Rami; Gibril, Mohamed Barakat A.; Khalil, Mohamad Ali] Univ Sharjah, Res Inst Sci & Engn, GIS & Remote Sensing Ctr, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates; [Shanableh, Abdallah; Al-Ruzouq, Rami] Univ Sharjah, Civil & Environm Engn Dept, Sharjah 27272, U Arab Emirates; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Ctr Adv Modelling & Geospatial Informat Syst CAMGI, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Inst Climate Change, Earth Observat Ctr, Bangi 43600, Selangor, Malaysia; [Ghorbanzadeh, Omid; Ghamisi, Pedram] Inst Adv Res Artificial Intelligence IARAI, Landstrasser Hauptstr 5, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Ghorbanzadeh, Omid; Atzberger, Clement] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Geomat, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria; [Mittal, Himanshu] Govt India, Minist Earth Sci, Natl Ctr Seismol, New Delhi 110003, India; [Ghamisi, Pedram] Helmholtz Zent Dresden Rossendorf, Helmholtz Inst Freiberg Resource Technol, MachineLearning Grp, Chemnitzer St 40, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany",,"Ghorbanzadeh, O (corresponding author), Inst Adv Res Artificial Intelligence IARAI, Landstrasser Hauptstr 5, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.;Ghorbanzadeh, O (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Inst Geomat, Peter Jordan Str 82, A-1190 Vienna, Austria.",jena@sharjah.ac.ae; omid.ghorbanzadeh@boku.ac.at,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2023,15.0,15,,,,,,,3759,10.3390/rs15153759,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15153759,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001046262500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, empirical studies in diverse mountain ranges give evidence of both advancing alpine treelines as well as rather insignificant responses. In this context, we aim at investigating the sensitivity and responsiveness of the near-natural treeline ecotone in Rolwaling Himal, Nepal, to climate warming. We analysed population densities of tree species along the treeline ecotone from closed forest stands via the krummholz belt to alpine dwarf shrub heaths (3700-4200 m) at 50 plots in 2013 and 2014. We quantified species - environment relationships, i.e. the change of environmental conditions (e.g., nutrient and thermal deficits, plant interactions) across the ecotone by means of redundancy analyses, variation partitioning and distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps. In particular, we focus on explaining the high competitiveness of Rhododendron campanulatum forming a dense krummholz belt and on the implications for the responsiveness of Himalayan krummholz treelines to climate change. Results indicate that treeline trees in the ecotone show species-specific responses to the influence of environmental parameters, and that juvenile and adult tree responses are modulated by environmental constraints in differing intensity. Moreover, the species - environment relationships suggest that the investigated krummholz belt will largely prevent the upward migration of other tree species and thus constrain the future response of Himalayan krummholz treelines to climate warming.","[Schwab, Niels; Schickhoff, Udo; Buerzle, Birgit; Boehner, Jurgen] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, CEN Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Mueller, Michael; Scholten, Thomas] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Chair Soil Sci & Geomorphol, Tubingen, Germany; [Chaudhary, Ram Prasad] Tribhuvan Univ, Res Ctr Appl Sci & Technol, Kirtipur, Nepal; [Chaudhary, Ram Prasad] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kirtipur, Nepal; [Oldeland, Jens] Univ Hamburg, Bioctr Klein Flottbek, Ohnhorststr 18, D-22609 Hamburg, Germany",,"Schwab, N (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, CEN Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",niels.schwab@uni-hamburg.de; udo.schickhoff@uni-hamburg.de; birgit.buerzle@uni-hamburg.de; michael.mueller@uni-tuebingen.de; juergen.boehner@uni-hamburg.de; ram@cdbtu.wlink.com.np; thomas.scholten@uni-tuebingen.de; jens.oldeland@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,,12.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2017,14.0,3,,,,,453,473,,10.1007/s11629-016-4257-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-016-4257-z,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000396056200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) have been frequently executed by statistical models in NW Himalaya. However, the comparison and applications of the statistical models with modern machine learning techniques has not been fully explored in this region. Hence, this study aims to compare the predicted performance of statistical and popular machine learning models to explore robust landslide prediction model in the landslide-prone area of NW Himalaya and investigate the compensations and limitations of these models to grasp a more precise and consistent result. This study presented machine learning approaches based on the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) and the statistical methods based on the frequency ratio (FR), information value (InfoV) and weight of evidence (WoE). For this purpose, first an inventory map of 1507 landslides was prepared and randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) dataset. Furthermore, 12 landslide conditioning factors (LCFs) were extracted from geospatial dataset to prepare thematic layers in ArcGIS. Thereafter, factor analysis was performed to eliminate colinear and least important variables which can mislead the results. The results showed that all selected LCFs are noncolinear and have significant contribution on landslides initiation, however, lithology, slope angle, annual rainfall and landuse were most influential factors. For modeling purpose, landslide inventory was correlated against all LCFs and trained into six models to produce respective LSMs. Finally, the performance of produced LSM models was validated and compared through area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), Accuracy, Recall, F-1-score and Cohen's Kappa coefficients to assess the robustness of employed models. The results exhibit that the performance scores of machine learning models were considerably superior than statistical models. While, the AUROC values based on validation dataset indicate that LR (0.89) has better prediction ability followed by SVM (0.86), ANN (0.84), FR (0.83), InfoV (0.82) and WoE (0.81) in this study. Therefore, it is reasoned out that the machine learning methods are more reliable in generating adequate LSMs. However, the LR is recommended as most efficient model for predicting landslide susceptible zones in study region and thus can be considered as robust model for landslide susceptibility assessment in similar geo-environmental regimes.","[Ikram, Nawaz; Basharat, Muhammad; Riaz, Muhammad Tayyib] Univ Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Inst Geol, Muzaffarabad, Pakistan; [Ali, Asghar] Univ Peshawar, Dept Geol, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Usmani, Nadeem Ahmad] Geol Survey Pakistan, Directorate Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, Pakistan; [Usmani, Nadeem Ahmad] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Earth Surface Processes, Chengdu, Peoples R China; [Hussain, Mian Luqman] Univ Peshawar, Nat Ctr Excellence Geol, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Riaz, Muhammad Tayyib] Univ Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Dept Geol, Athmuqam, Pakistan",,"Basharat, M (corresponding author), Univ Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Inst Geol, Muzaffarabad, Pakistan.",basharatgeo@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 13,2022,37.0,25,,,,,9204,9241,,10.1080/10106049.2021.2017010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2021.2017010,,DEC 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000734251800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Communities in the NCR face significant exposure to damaging seismic events, and the seismic risk arises not only from the region's proximity to the Himalayan mountains, but also from the socioeconomic vulnerabilities in its communities and the current capacities of different localities to respond to and recover from any unforeseen large seismic event. GIS-based spatial distribution of exposure to seismic hazards (SH) can help decision-makers and authorities identify locations with populations at high seismic risk, and to prepare risk-mitigation plans. Socioeconomic vulnerability (SeV) studies serve as a basis for quantifying qualitative measures. For this purpose, in the present study, the hazard of place (HoP) model is used to assess SeV to seismic hazards in the NCR. Social indicators like age, gender, literacy, family size, built environment, etc., comprising a total of 36 variables, are used to assess a socioeconomic vulnerability index (SeVI) based on factor and principal component (PCA) analyses. Based on PCA, 20 variables were retained and grouped into four factors: socioeconomic status, employment status, building typology, and family size. Ground-motion parameters, estimated from probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, are integrated with the socioeconomic vulnerability index to quantify exposure to seismic hazards. The spatial distributions in the produced socioeconomic-vulnerability index and seismic-hazard-exposure maps highlight the critical areas. The results reveal that areas of low literacy, high unemployment, and poor housing condition show moderate-to-high vulnerability. The south-eastern region of the study area is assessed as a high-risk zone by an integrated SeV-SH risk matrix. The results of this study emphasize the importance of the socioeconomic vulnerability component of disaster risk-reduction programs, from a holistic perspective, for the areas with high seismicity.","[Agrawal, Navdeep; Gupta, Laxmi; Dixit, Jagabandhu] Shiv Nadar Univ, Disaster Management Lab, Greater Noida 201314, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Dixit, J (corresponding author), Shiv Nadar Univ, Disaster Management Lab, Greater Noida 201314, Uttar Pradesh, India.",na655@snu.edu.in; lg100@snu.edu.in; jagabandhu.dixit@snu.edu.in,,,,,,,,15.0,15.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,13.0,17,,,,,,,9652,10.3390/su13179652,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13179652,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000694462700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigates the future water availability in the Langtang basin, Central Himalayas, Nepal under climate change scenarios using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques. The daily snow area for the region was derived from MODIS images. The outputs of climate models were used to project the temperature and precipitation until 2100. Three ML models, including Gated recurrent unit (GRU), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Recurrent neural network (RNN), were developed for snowmelt runoff prediction, and their performance was compared based on statistical indicators. The result suggests that the mean temperature of the basin could rise by 4.98 degrees C by the end of the century. The annual average precipitation in the basin is likely to increase in the future, especially due to high monsoon rainfall, but winter precipitation could decline. The annual river discharge is projected to upsurge significantly due to increased precipitation and snowmelt, and no shift in hydrograph is expected in the future. Among three ML models, the LSTM model performed better than GRU and RNN models. In summary, this study depicts severe future climate change in the region and quantifies its effect on river discharge. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the suitability of the LSTM model in streamflow prediction in the data-scarce HKH region. The outcomes of this study will be useful for water resource managers and planners in developing strategies to harness the positive impacts and offset the negative effects of climate change in the basin.","[Thapa, Samit; Li, Haizhi; Fu, Donglei; Shi, Xiaofei; Yabo, Stephen; Lu, Lu; Qi, Hong] Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Thapa, Samit; Li, Bo; Fu, Donglei; Shi, Xiaofei; Yabo, Stephen; Lu, Lu; Qi, Hong] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Environm, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Li, Haizhi] Heilongjiang Prov Environm Monitoring Ctr Stn, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Shi, Xiaofei] CASIC Intelligence Ind Dev Co Ltd, Beijing 100854, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin, Peoples R China",,"Qi, H (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin, Peoples R China.;Zhang, W (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Harbin, Peoples R China.",hongqi@hit.edu.cn; weizhang@hit.edu.cn,,,,,,,,10.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2021,193.0,7,,,,,,,393,10.1007/s10661-021-09197-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09197-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000757352900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the geochemistry of Himalayan river sediments has been less studied. Surface sediment samples collected from a typical trans-Himalayan river, the Koshi River (KR), were used to investigate the distribution, pollution status and potential sources of heavy metals. Heavy metals did not show significant spatial differences between the upstream and downstream areas of the river, but Cd and Pb displayed higher values in the upstream area. The average heavy metal concentrations in the KR sediments are comparable to the natural background values and are lower than the sediment guidelines. Pollution assessment using the geo-accumulation index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF) and pollution load index (PLI) suggested negligible anthropogenic disturbances except for slight contamination by Cd, Pb and Cu at a few sites. Principal component analysis revealed that Cr, Co, Ni and Zn were primarily from the parent rock and that Cu, Cd and Pb were derived from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Despite contrasting environmental settings and human activities in the upper and lower reaches of the river, the heavy metals concentrations in the KR sediments showed consistency with natural backgrounds and negligible contamination.

It is important to conduct geopolitical risk assessments to facilitate the restoration and construction of traditional trade routes in the Himalayan region. Based on multisource natural, political, and socioeconomic data, we selected 12 indicators, including topographic relief, landslide risk, multi-hazard index, population density, territorial disputes, conflict risk, corruption perception index, transboundary water disputed risk, night light index, GDP, accessibility, and economic freedom, to assess these risks. A comprehensive assessment of the geopolitical risk in the Himalayan region is presented using the random forest (RF) model, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), entropy weight method, and AHP-entropy weight method. The results indicated that the geopolitical risk in the Himalayan region is generally high in the north and low in the south, with high level of risk primarily concentrated in the Kashmir valley and south, south-central Nepal and southern Tibet, and low level of risk mainly concentrated in the Bhutan and Tibet border areas of China. The high likelihood of natural risk is largely concentrated in the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Nepal, southeastern Bhutan, and southern Tibet. Significant political risk is mostly confined to the Kashmir valley and its south, while economic risk is mostly concentrated in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan, Pakistani-administered regions of Kashmir, and Nepal. Geopolitical risk assessment based on the grid scale can better reveal and portray the spatial distribution of geopolitical risk in the Himalayan region and provide a basis for the restoration and construction of traditional trade routes in this region. According to the results of the geopolitical risk assessment, it is recommended that priority be given to construction in areas of relatively low risk, such as those close to Burang Country and Mustang, and that integrated planning be carried out for the restoration and construction of the predominantly low-risk trade routes between China and Bhutan, with further comprehensive analysis of each route conducted in conjunction with field surveys and proposed construction and control strategies.","[Wu, Shihai; Yan, Jianzhong] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yili] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yili] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yili] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Yan, JZ (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China.",yanjzswu@126.com,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,14.0,15,,,,,,,9743,10.3390/su14159743,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14159743,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000839149500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Invasive plants, such as L. camara, pose significant threats to the rich biodiversity of the region due to their ability to replace native vegetation and spread rapidly under a warming climate. Additionally, chir pines (P. roxburghii) are replacing banj oak (Q. leucotrichophora) forests. Oak forests support rich biodiversity and are also preferred by the local com-munities for meeting their livelihood requirements. In this study, we ask whether green bonds could be utilized for financing the restoration of desirable forest species and enhancing their resilience to natural hazards such as fires. In particular, we explore the possibility of linking green bond yields to the species composition of forests for incentivizing the protection of oak forests. We develop an optimization model of community led restoration of oak and pine forests that are infested with L. camara. Restoring oak forests mitigates the risk of forest fires, improves forest water supply, and controls the spread of the invasive lantana. Findings indicate that such species composition based green bonds, when coupled with payments for ecosystem services programs, can indeed incentivize higher restoration efforts, resulting in an improvement in the biodiversity richness of the region.","[Ranjan, Ram] Shiv Nadar Inst Eminence, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Ranjan, R (corresponding author), Shiv Nadar Inst Eminence, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Dept Econ, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.",ram.ranjan@snu.edu.in,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 15,2022,379.0,,1,,,,,,134708,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134708,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.134708,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000879957700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The estimation of adaptive capacity scores for surveyed households and villages were done based on preselected indicator scores of the natural, human, financial, and physical capital assets. The exposure to climate shock was obtained from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) data of different scenarios. The present and future vulnerability scores were assessed based on the adaptive capacity, exposure and sensitivity to climatic shock. The villages and households were grouped in resilient and vulnerable clusters, and major indicators determining the vulnerability were identified. Our result revealed the household and village level adaptive capacity were low in the Bhagirathi and Teesta basin compared to the Beas basin, so as the present and future climate shock. We found that access to different resources as well as natural and financial capital assets were the major governing factor for the adaptive capacity of the villages.

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations measured in 13 lakes to the south of Mount Everest (Nepal) in October 2008 and reflectance values of the Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 (AVNIR-2) onboard ALOS, acquired a few days after the fieldwork activities concluded, were combined to build a relationship (R-2 = 0.921) for mapping SPM concentrations in lakes of the Mount Everest region. The satellite-derived SPM concentrations were compared with in situ data (R-2 = 0.924) collected in the same period in 4 additional lakes, located to the north of Mount Everest (Tibet, China). The 13 water samples collected in lakes in Nepal were also used to investigate the absorption coefficients of particles a(p)(lambda) and colored, dissolved organic matter a(CDOM)(lambda), with the aim of parameterizing a bio-optical model. An accurate model (R-2 = 0.965) to estimate SPM concentrations from a(p)(lambda) was found and could be adopted in the future for retrieving suspended solids from satellite imagery independently of ground measurements. In such a remote area, remote sensing was demonstrated to be a suitable tool to characterize the state of lakes, whose loads of suspended solids might be assumed to be direct and quick-responding indicators of deglaciation processes and glacier-lake interactions. As a macrodescriptor of water quality, the assessment of SPM in glacial lakes of the Himalayas might also be of interest for resource use in the downstream region.","[Giardino, Claudia; Bresciani, Mariano] CNR, Ist Rilevamento Elettromagnet Ambiente, Natl Res Council, Inst Electromagnet Sensing Environm, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Oggioni, Alessandro] Ev K2 CNR Comm, I-24126 Bergamo, Italy; [Oggioni, Alessandro] CNR, Ist Rilevamento Elettromagnet Ambiente, Natl Res Council, Inst Ecosyst Studies, I-28922 Verbania, Italy; [Yan, Huimin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Giardino, C (corresponding author), CNR, Ist Rilevamento Elettromagnet Ambiente, Natl Res Council, Inst Electromagnet Sensing Environm, Via Bassini 15, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",giardino.c@irea.cnr.it,,,,,,,,28.0,31.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2010,30.0,2,,,,,157,168,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-09-00042.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-09-00042.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000279341600009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Exploring Community Perceptions Through Parallel Analysis in Rural Himalaya,MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Human dimensions of climate change (HDCC) research overwhelmingly presents community perspectives on climate change and its impacts through single epistemic frameworks. This limits the possible platforms that community voices can access within scientific scholarship. Many HDCC interdisciplinary collaborations pursue the goal of data triangulation and attempt to address complex social-ecological problems through analytical integration. This raises questions about the comparative validity of different epistemologies and often leads to unequal power sharing between the different disciplinary practitioners. Our research addresses both of these issues by operationalizing a plural epistemological framework that depends on parallel analysis. This framework consists of a quantitative approach, inspired by hazards theory and change science research, and a qualitative approach, from political ecology. We explored perceptions of climate change in rural households in Uttarakhand in the Indian Himalayan region. While the results reveal a high awareness of climate change within the community, most individuals and households do not consider the impacts of climate change to be a significant worry. The results for each approach complement each other. They provide the community with more than one platform to voice their experiences and reveal the complex relationships producing climate change knowledge in the region. Future research should attempt such parallel analysis in other locations to validate its utility in addressing issues of equity and marginalization between research epistemologies, as well as between experts and local communities.","[Chakraborty, Ritodhi] Lincoln Univ, Ctr Excellence Designing Future Prod Landscapes, Canterbury 7608, New Zealand; [Chakraborty, Ritodhi] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Geog, 550 N Pk St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Daloz, Anne Sophie] CICERO, Senter Klimaforskning, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Daloz, Anne Sophie] Univ Wisconsin, Space & Sci Engn Ctr, 1225 W Dayton St, Madison, WI USA; [Daloz, Anne Sophie] Univ Wisconsin, Ctr Climat Res, 1225 W Dayton St, Madison, WI USA; [Kumar, Manish] ATREE, Bengaluru 560064, India; [Dimri, A.

For this purpose, the study area was selected in a part of Ravi river catchment along one of the landslide prone Chamba to Bharmour road corridor of National Highway (NH-154A) in Himachal Pradesh, India. A numeral landslide triggering geoenvironmental factors i.e. slope, aspect, relative relief, soil, curvature, land use and land cover (LULC), lithology, drainage density, and lineament density were selected for landslide hazard mapping based on landslide inventory. Landslide hazard zonation map was categorized namely very high hazard, high hazard, medium hazard, low hazard, and very low hazard. The results from these two methods were validated using Area Under Curve (AUC) plots. It is found that hazard zonation map prepared using information value method and analytical hierarchy process methods possess the prediction rate of 78.87% and 75.42%, respectively. Hence, landslide hazard zonation map obtained using information value method is proposed to be more useful for the study area. These final hazard zonation maps can be used by various stakeholders like engineers and administrators for proper maintenance and smooth traffic flow between Chamba and Bharmour cities, which is the only route connecting these tourist places.","[Singh, Kanwarpreet; Kumar, Virender] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Hamirpur 177005, India",,"Singh, K (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Hamirpur 177005, India.",singhkanwarpreetnit@gmail.com; sardavk@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,34.0,40.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2018,15.0,4,,,,,808,824,,10.1007/s11629-017-4634-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-017-4634-2,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000429949900011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Trends in the seasonal and long-term melting of snow and glaciers, governed by initial ice reserves, meteorological factors and geographic features, vary across sub-basins in the HMA region. We examined the economic impacts of climate-led changes in river flow in two drainage basins, one each from the Karakoram and Central Himalaya region. We used an integrated assessment framework to estimate the changes in economic value of the hydropower generation from hydropower plants on rivers fed by snow and glacier melt in the two sub-basins. The framework, developed under a NASA High Mountain Asia project, coupled biophysical models (a suite of climate models, snow/glacier-hydrology, and hydropower model) with economic analysis. We compared the differences in estimated river flow over historic and future time using the water balance model in sixteen scenarios (eight climate models and two emissions scenarios) for rivers upstream of hydropower plants in each sub-basin. Using the hydropower model we developed, we estimated the changes in hydropower generation at the Naltar IV hydropower plant, with an 18 MW capacity, located in Hunza, Karakoram, and the Trishuli hydropower plant, with a 19.6 MW capacity, in Trishuli, Central Himalaya. When compared to their baselines, the estimated impact of climate change and temporal variability were higher for the Naltar plant than for the Trishuli plant. Our sensitivity analysis shows that hydropower plants with water storage facilities help reduce the impact of changes, but the estimated impacts are higher for the higher capacity plants. This study provides an example of the differential impacts of climate change on hydropower plants located in rivers fed by varying amounts of snow and glacier melt at different decades in this century. This type of integrated assessment of climate change impact will support the scientific understanding of hydrologic flow and its impacts on a hydropower economy under various climate scenarios, as well as generate information about water resource management in a changing climate.","[Mishra, Shruti K.; Veselka, Thomas D.; Christian, Mark H.] Argonne Natl Lab, Lemont, IL 60439 USA; [Prusevich, Alexander A.; Grogan, Danielle S.; Lammers, Richard B.] Univ New Hampshire, Earth Syst Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Rounce, David R.] Univ Alaska, Geophys Inst, Fairbanks, AK 99701 USA; [Ali, Syed H.] Pakistan Water & Power Dev Author, Lahore, Pakistan",,"Mishra, SK (corresponding author), Argonne Natl Lab, Lemont, IL 60439 USA.",mishra@anl.gov,,,,,,,,19.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 13,2020,8.0,,,,,,,,26,10.3389/fenvs.2020.00026,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2020.00026,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000526717800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present paper provides information on the population and bark removal of Himalayan yew from one of the interior areas of Himalaya. Total count and quadrat method were deployed to generate quantitative information on its population while bark removal was estimated based on depth and extent of bark removed. After analyzing the existing information and the results of the study, a rapid vulnerability assessment (RVA) of the species was carried out. Taxus reported a density of 72 individuals/ha and was present as an under canopy of Picea smithiana. Complete stripping of bark was observed in 11 % of the Taxus population which amounted to ca. 18,152.86 cm(3) of bark removed. The age class distribution showed complete absence of seedlings and saplings. RVA scores also reported higher values (26) thereby pointing toward the high vulnerability of this species.

The basin is disrupted by two regional scale thrusts (Bhotechaur Thrust and Kapurkot Thrust) and several imbricate faults making it prone to instabilities. The river valley is heavily populated as the growing population has forced the people to dwell in such risky zone. Thus, it is very essential to develop a landslide hazard map of this basin. In this respect, we have used an evidential belief function (EBF) model in the GIS environment to know different landslide-susceptible zones in the watershed. For this, a landslide inventory map consisting of 279 different types of landslides was generated from the published topographic maps, aerial photograph, and Google Earth image interpretations and from the detailed filed survey. From the mapped landslides, 80 % were randomly selected for developing the model, and the remaining 20 % were used for validating the model. Twelve different landslide causative factors were considered for this study. Thus, from the analysis of the landslide data and factor maps, a susceptibility map of the region was obtained by using the EBF model. The map was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of success and prediction rate. The verification result showed that the model performed very well with the success rate of 85.13 %, and predictive accuracy is 86.42 %. The produced susceptibility map can be useful for general land-use planning, as well as it can provide information to the planners for the adaptation of appropriate mitigating measures for landside hazards in the Patu Khola watershed.","[Regmi, Amar Deep] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Surface Proc, Chengdu 610044, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Regmi, Amar Deep] Nepal Acad Sci & Technol, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Poudel, Khagendra] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Geol, Kirtipur, Nepal",,"Regmi, AD (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Surface Proc, Chengdu 610044, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Regmi, AD (corresponding author), Nepal Acad Sci & Technol, Lalitpur, Nepal.",amardeep_regmi@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,9.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2016,75.0,9,,,,,,,743,10.1007/s12665-016-5562-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5562-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000376030100020,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is increasing attention and call for practitioners to adopt proactive and participatory approaches to help in the adaptive response planning process. One such toolkit is the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCRN) Process (IAP). This is a simple but rigorous toolkit developed to help local governments in Asian cities build resilience to the impacts of climate change. This paper outlines the application of the toolkit to determine its versatility in the rural context and was trialled in the Himalayan rural enclave of Ramgad in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. Given the differences between urban and rural environments, the outcomes highlighted the need for further investigation and analysis into the process to ensure that the methodology truly reflects the nature of rural systems and their level of vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Overall, the toolkit proved to be a simple but versatile toolkit to assess the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of communities in rural Himalaya. Over 40 resilience intervention strategies were developed for the Ramgad enclave and these were prioritized according to their technical, political, social and economic feasibility.","[Heath, Lance C.; Xu, Tingbao; Li, Geraldine] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Soc & Environm, Bldg 141,Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Heath, Lance C.] Sustineo Pty Ltd, 1b-32 Thesiger Court, Canberra, ACT 2612, Australia; [Heath, Lance C.] Freelance Solut, 37 Loftus St, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia; [Tiwari, Prakash] Kumaon Univ, Naini Tal 263001, India; [Sadhukhan, Bedoshruti] Local Govt Sustainabil South Asia, ICLEI, C-3 Green Pk Extens, New Delhi, India; [Tiwari, Sunandan] ICLEI, World Secretariat, Kaiser Friedrich Str 7, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Chapagain, Prem] Tribhuvan Univ, Kirtipur, Nepal; [Ailikun] Chinese Acad Sci, 16 Lincui Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Joshi, Bhagwati] Govt Postgrad Coll, Rudrapur 263153, India; [Yan, Jianzhong] Southwest Univ, Chongqing, Peoples R China",,"Heath, LC (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Sustineo Pty Ltd, Freelance Solut, Lance Heath, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",lheath@grapevine.com.au; pctiwari@yahoo.com; shruti.sadhukhan@iclei.org; sunandan.tiwari@iclei.org; ps.chapagain@gmail.com; Tingbao.Xu@anu.edu.au; gli@fronteirsi.com.au; aili@mairs-essp.org; bhawanatiwari@yahoo.com; yanjzswu@126.com,,,,,,,,9.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2020,188.0,,,,,,,,109636,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109636,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109636,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000564662200020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The RCM results suggest an increase in mean annual temperature, averaged over the Ganges basin, in the range 1-4 degrees C over the period from 2000 to 2050, using the SRES A1B forcing scenario. Projections of precipitation indicate that natural variability dominates the climate change signal and there is considerable uncertainty concerning change in regional annual mean precipitation by 2050. The RCMs do suggest an increase in annual mean precipitation in this region to 2050, but lack significant trend. Glaciers in headwater tributary basins of the Ganges appear to be continuing to decline but it is not clear whether meltwater runoff continues to increase. The predicted changes in precipitation and temperature will probably not lead to significant increase in water availability to 2050, but the timing of runoff from snowmelt will likely occur earlier in spring and summer. Water availability is subject to decadal variability, with much uncertainty in the contribution from climate change. Although global social-economic scenarios show trends to urbanization, locally these trends are less evident and in some districts rural population is increasing. Falling ground-water levels in the Ganges plain may prevent expansion of irrigated areas for food supply. Changes in socio-economic development in combination with projected changes in timing of runoff outside the monsoon period will make difficult choices for water managers. Because of the uncertainty in future water availability trends, decreasing vulnerability by augmenting resilience is the preferred way to adapt to climate change. Adaptive policies are required to increase society's capacity to adapt to both anticipated and unanticipated conditions. Integrated solutions are needed, consistent at various spatial scales, to assure robust and sustainable future use of resources. For water resources this is at the river basin scale. At present adaptation measures in India are planned at national and state level, not taking into account the physical boundaries of water systems. To increase resilience adaptation plans should be made locally specific. However, as it is expected that the partitioning of water over the different sectors and regions will be the biggest constraint, a consistent water use plan at catchment and river basin scale may be the best solution. A policy enabling such river basin planning is essential. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Mass wasting appears to be the dominant process shaping the morphology of the main river channel in the Hunza River watershed. The project included assembling an inventory of historic mass wasting features in the basin, especially, those along the Hunza River. A hillshade topographic map was created by stitching ASTER Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) with 30 m resolution topographic sheets of 40 m resolution, using ArcGIS. The methodology utilizes anomalous topographic expression (i.e., parallel and converging drainage patterns, divergent contours, crenulated contours, and isolated knobs) to identify landslide features. The screening process includes examination of topographic anomalies and inconsistencies, which are typical of landslides and related mass wasting features. The mapped landslide features included a number of historic landslides in the area. Historic landslide damming of the Hunza River has occurred at Attabad, Boultar Glacier, Gannish-Chiss, and Ganesh-Saukien. The outbreak floods associated with the overtopping of these recent landslide dams often leave anomalous geomorphic signatures, which were identified in the terrain analysis, and helped validate the interpretations made as part of this study.

We quantified tree carbon (TC) storage from 143 plots distributed across three major forest types of Kashmir Himalaya, relative to differences in ecological factors. Combined regression and Random Forest (RF) analysis were used to examine the distribution of TC stock along ecological gradients and recognize the role of driving factors on TC stocks. Results Among the three forest types, sub-alpine (SA) forest was the primary TC sink, accounting for 228.73 t ha(-1) of carbon, followed by mixed conifer (MC; 181.29 t C ha(-1)) and blue pine (BP; 133.04 t C ha(-1)) forests. The distribution of TC stocks among the three forest types differed significantly (chi(2) = 18.87; P = 0.000). Relative carbon stock analysis demonstrated that Abies pindrow and Pinus wallichiana accounted 91% of TC stocks across the landscape. Basal area, mean diameter at breast height (DBH), elevation, disturbance and precipitation had significant effects on TC stocks in bivariate regression models. The RF model explained 86% of the variation; basal area interpreted 30.15%, followed by mean DBH (17.96%), disturbance complex (10.64%), precipitation (8.00%) and elevation (7.34%). Conclusions Kashmir Himalayan forests are significant carbon sinks as they store a substantial quantum of carbon in trees. Forest carbon, an essential climatic indicator, is determined by a complex interaction of other ecological variables, particularly stand structural features. The study provides insights into the role of these natural forests in climate change mitigation and in REDD+/national commitments to offset the carbon.","[Dar, Ashaq Ahmad; Parthasarathy, Narayanaswamy] Pondicherry Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India",,"Parthasarathy, N (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India.",nparthasarathypu@gmail.com,,,,,,,,7.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 15,2022,11.0,1,,,,,,,58,10.1186/s13717-022-00402-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-022-00402-z,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000854134400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The climatic and orographic conditions result in unique modelling challenges and requirements. This paper critically appraises recent hydrological modelling applications in Himalayan river basins, focusing on their utility to analyse the impacts of future climate and socio-economic changes on water resource availability in the region. Results show that the latter are only represented by land use change. Distributed, process-based hydrological models coupled with temperature-index melt models are predominant. The choice of spatial discretisation is critical for model performance due to the strong influence of elevation on meteorological variables and snow/ice accumulation and melt. However, the sparsity and limited reliability of point weather data, and the biases and low resolution of gridded datasets, hinder the representation of the meteorological complexity. These data limitations often limit the selection of models and the quality of the outputs by forcing the exclusion of processes that are significant to the local hydrology. The absence of observations for water stores and fluxes other than river flows prevents multi-variable calibration and increases the risk of equifinality. The uncertainties arising from these limitations are amplified in climate change analyses and, thus, systematic assessment of uncertainty propagation is required. Based on these insights, transferable recommendations are made on directions for future data collection and model applications that may enhance realism within models and advance the ability of global change impact assessments to inform adaptation planning in this globally important region.","[Momblanch, Andrea; Holman, Ian P.] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England; [Jain, Sanjay K.] Natl Inst Hydrol Roorkee, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Momblanch, A (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Cranfield Water Sci Inst, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",andrea.momblanch-benavent@cranfield.ac.uk; i.holman@cranfield.ac.uk; sanjay.nih@gmail.com,,,,,,,,19.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2019,11.0,6,,,,,,,1303,10.3390/w11061303,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11061303,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000475346300191,View Full Record in Web of Science

Betula utilis (Himalayan birch), a principal tree species defining the natural treeline in Himalayas, is a potential indicator species to track the signal of climate change. The present study models the ensemble distribution of B. utilis using Biomod2 package for present and future (RCP's 2.6-8.5 covering 2050 and 2070). The final ensemble model obtained had AUC=0.886 and TSS=0.655, thus indicating robustness of the model. We assessed change in the habitat suitability, area expansion and contraction based on ensemble model using SDM Toolbox. The highly suitable area for B. utilis is predicted to shift towards the eastern parts of Himalayas in future, with suitability declining towards the western part of Himalayas. The study, to our best knowledge, for the first time used Ecospat package to assess niche dynamics (i.e. overlap, similarity and equivalency) of B. utilis, which predicted the climatic niche of this treeline species is moderately shifting in future scenarios. Further, the PCA analysis indicated that significant variation (33.45% on PC1 and 24.63% on PC2) exists in the climatic conditions between current and future scenarios. The similarity and equivalency test revealed that B. utilis niche is similar but not identical between current and future climate change scenarios.

To understand the characteristics of the landscape, we calculate geomorphic matrices including the topographic variables, longitudinal and topographic swath profile, channel steepness index, and stream length gradient index to analyze the spatial distribution of landslide occurrences over landscape evolution. The intensity of rainfall gradient and topographic variables were spatially correlated with the erosion and exhumation rates of the studied catchment. Our analysis suggests that the zones with slope ranges of 24 degrees-28 degrees, relief ranges of 800-1000 m, and elevation ranges of 1500-1700 m, which coincide with the rainfall intensity range of 2500-2700 mm/year in the Teesta river catchment, have the highest probability of frequently occurring landslides. Higher tectonic activity is principally responsible for the landslide over the Higher Himalaya to the north of the Main Central Thrust (MCT)-Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) along the orographic barrier. In contrast, litho-tectonics regulates and mostly triggers landslides adjacent to the MCT-MBT structural affinity dominated by rainfall intensity. Our observation suggests that erosion rates frequently exceed long-term exhumation rates and are spatially more variable. Moreover, they exhibit significantly divergent spatial patterns, which suggests that the processes governing these rates are independent. Exhumation rates have been shown to decrease from south to north over geological periods, rising in the southwest region at similar to 1.2 mm/year and decreasing to similar to 0.5 mm/year in the northernmost region of the Teesta catchment. Long-term exhumation rates are not correlated with geomorphic or climatic variables.

The rich biodiversity and bounty of ecosystem services provided by this 'water tower' and the 'Third Pole' are under higher risk. Though there is scattered and sectoral knowledge available, comprehensive understanding on climate change and its impact on biodiversity is lacking in the HKH. To fill this gap, a systematic literature review using search, appraisal, synthesis, and analysis (SALSA) was undertaken to look at temporal and spatial trends of research focusing on the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services. The increasing trend and evolution of research from sectoral to multidisciplinarity approach with increasing focus on impacts suggested a strong influence from regional priority and global discourse. There is a clear pattern of biophysical and environmental focused research in the early phase of the 1990s to societal concerns highlighting vulnerability, adaptation, and mitigation measures at the later phases. The review also revealed an increasing trend in multidisciplinary, networking and bringing innovative tools in research linking climate change and biodiversity. However, the research showed greater focus in the Tibetan plateau and alpine ecosystem with decreasing interest in the forest ecosystems, and a very negligible focus on wetlands. Studies on impact assessments are increasing but at a relatively low rate. Better representation of investments based on vulnerable ecosystems, underrepresented countries and collaborative regional research on emerging priority areas such as restoration and larger scale nature-based solutions could contribute to climate resilience in the HKH.","[Chettri, Nakul; Adhikari, Biraj; Chaudhary, Sunita; Wangchuk, Kesang] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Chettri, N (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.",Nakul.Chettri@icimod.org,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2023,155.0,,,,,,,,111046,10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111046,,OCT 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001096825100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nepal is one among these countries, being landlocked, with diverse physiographical characteristics within a relatively small territory and with rugged terrain. Poverty is widespread and the capacity of people and the country to cope with climate change impact is low. The country is dominated by the Asian monsoon system. The main occupation is agriculture, largely based on rain-fed farming practices. Tourism based on high altitude adventures is one of the major sources of income for the country. Nepal has a large hydropower potential. While only 0.75% of the theoretical hydropower potential has been tapped, Nepal can greatly benefit from this natural resource in the future. Climate change can adversely impact upon water resources and other sectors of Nepal. The source of water is mainly summer monsoon precipitation and the melting of the large reserve of snow and glaciers in the Himalayan highlands. Observations show clear evidences of significant warming. The average trend in the country is 0.06 degrees C per year. The warming rates are progressively higher for high elevation locations. The warming climate has resulted in rapid shrinking of majority of glaciers in Nepal. This paper presents state-of-knowledge on the glacial dynamics in the country based on studies conducted in the past in Shorong, Khumbu, Langtang, Dhaulagiri and Kanchenjunga regions of Nepal. We present recent trends in river flow and an overview of studies on expected changes in the hydrological regime due to climate change. Formation, growth and likely outburst of glacial lake are phenomena directly related to climate change and deglaciation. This paper provides a synopsis of past glacial lake outburst floods impacting Nepal. Further, likely impacts of climate change on other sectors such as agriculture, biodiversity, human health and livelihoods are discussed.","[Shrestha, Arun B.] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Aryal, Raju] Univ No British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2L 5P2, Canada",,"Shrestha, AB (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, POB 3226, Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Nepal.",abshrestha@icimod.org,,,,,,,,266.0,297.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2011,11.0,,,1.0,,,S65,S77,,10.1007/s10113-010-0174-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-010-0174-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000287596600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Landslides along the roads is one of the critical problems in hilly areas. Landslide vulnerability maps can serve as an effective tool for the planning and management of landslide disasters. The primary goal of the present study is to generate a Landslide hazard map along the Mughal Road. An integrated approach of Remote sensing GIS and AHP was used applied for this purpose. The eight most important landslide occurrence parameters including slope aspect, geology, elevation, slope angle, lineament buffer, drainage buffer, landuse/landcover and NDVI were employed in the present model. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Digital Elevation Model and Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor imagery were used to prepare these thematic layers in Arc GIS environment. The analysis of the final landslide hazard map reveals that, very low, low and moderate landslide hazard zones constitute 0.6%, 15.8% and 41.3% of the total area in the study region, respectively. While High and very high landslide hazard zones account for 30.2% and 12.2%, respectively of the total geographical area in the study region. Finally, an inventory of landslides has been used to validate the findings of the study. The landslide hazard zonation map has been also compared with the Landslide inventory map through the ROC-AOC method. The applied model produced an excellent result for landslide hazard mapping in the research region, as shown by the spatial effectiveness of the generated landslide hazard map validated by AUC (77.7% of accuracy).

The Yamuna River valley, NW Himalaya, which traverses the Higher Himalaya (HH) and Lesser Himalaya (LH) rock mass, endures disastrous landslides and hence is taken as the case for study. To achieve the objectives, proxies like stream length gradient, topographic profile, steepness index, and ratio of valley floor width to valley height were used to infer a spatially varying tectonic regime, whereas rainfall data and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were used to determine spatial differences in precipitation and vegetation variability, respectively. Dimensional patterns of landslides utilized the landslide area and volume. The higher reaches of the HH and lowest part of the LH show rockfall dominance associated with relatively high tectonic activity, whereas most of the debris slides coincide with regional thrusts.

The results from the public opinions showed a significant increase in temperature compared to a decade earlier, winters are getting warmer, water springs are drying up, change in concept of spring-water recharge (locally known as Mul Phutnu), changes in spring season, low crop yields, incidences of mosquitoes during winter, and decrease in rainfall in last 10 years. In addition, study also showed significant positive correlations of increase in temperature with other climate change indicators viz. spring-water recharge concept (R-2 = 0.893), warmer winter (R-2 = 0.839), drying up of water springs (R-2 = 0.76), changes in spring season (R-2 = 0.68), low crop yields (R-2 = 0.68), decrease in rainfall (R-2 = 0.63), and incidences of mosquitoes in winter (R-2 = 0.50). The air temperature for two meteorological stations of Sikkim indicated statistically significant increasing trend in mean minimum temperature and mean minimum winter temperature (DJF).

These lakes are known to destabilize the glaciers by enhancing their frontal ablation, causing higher than average glacier area and mass losses. Thus, to comprehend the dynamics of proglacial lakes and their influence on the overall glacier health, we study the lake-terminating Dulung Glacier located in the Suru sub-basin, Ladakh, western Himalaya and compare it with the adjacent land-terminating Chilung Glacier. The pronounced melting of the Dulung Glacier, supported by glacier topography (surface gradient between accumulation and ablation zone) and valley morphology (wider near the snout and narrower downwards), seems to be the prime reason for the formation, accommodation and sustenance of the proglacial lake. The expansion in proglacial lake (.008 km(2)a(-1)) during 1977-2018 is accompanied by an enhanced degeneration of the Dulung Glacier (mass balance: -.47 +/- .06 m w.e.a(-1), shrinkage rate: .3 +/- .001% a(-1); retreat rate: 32 +/- .7 ma(-1), surface ice velocity reduction: 16%), which has accelerated post-1993. In comparison, land-terminating Chilung Glacier shows lower degeneration rates (mass balance: -.28 +/- .02 m w.e.a(-1); shrinkage rate: .2 +/- .001% a(-1); retreat rate: 17 +/- 0.7 ma(-1), surface ice velocity reduction: 8%) during 1971-2018. This suggests a substantial impact of the proglacial lake in enhancing the Dulung Glacier's sensitivity towards climate change compared to the Chilung Glacier. If the current rate of lake expansion continues, it would further enhance the Dulung Glaciers' degeneration rates, thus impacting its stability.","[Garg, Siddhi; Garg, Purushottam Kumar; Yousuf, Bisma; Shukla, Aparna] Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Garg, Purushottam Kumar] Indian Inst Technol, Indore, India; [Yousuf, Bisma] Univ Jammu, Dept Remote Sensing & GIS, Jammu, India; [Shukla, Aparna] Minist Earth Sci, New Delhi, India; [Shukla, Uma Kant] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Geol, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Shukla, A (corresponding author), Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.;Shukla, A (corresponding author), Minist Earth Sci, New Delhi, India.",aparna.shukla22@gmail.com,,,,,,,,5.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 16,2022,10.0,,,,,,,,788359,10.3389/fenvs.2022.788359,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.788359,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000764336700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A deglaciation of 26.1% (29.1 km(2)) in terms of area from 1966 to 2011 was observed. Lower altitude small glaciers (area < 1 km(2)) lost more ice (34%), while glaciers with an area < 10 km(2) lost less (20%). The percentage of change in glacier length was 26% (31.9 km) from 1966 to 2011. The south-facing glaciers showed high percentages of loss. From 2000 to 2011, debris cover has increased by 1.34%.

Identifying the distribution of SESs is crucial for integrating and formulating effective programs and policies to ensure human well-being while protecting and conserving natural systems. This work aims to identify and spatially map the boundaries of SESs to address the questions of how SESs can be delineated and what the characteristics of these systems are. The study was carried out for the state of Uttarakhand, India, a part of the Central Himalaya. The presented approach for mapping and delineation of SESs merges socio-economic and ecological data. It also includes validation of delineated system boundaries. We used 32 variables to form socio-economic units and 14 biophysical variables for ecological units. Principal component analysis followed by sequential agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis was used to delineate the units. The geospatial statistical analysis identified 6 socio-economic and 3 ecological units, together resulting in 18 SESs for the entire state. The major characteristics for SESs were identified as forest types and agricultural practices, indicating the influence and dependency of SESs on these two features. The database would facilitate diverse application studies in vulnerability assessment, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and other socio-ecological studies. Such a detailed database addresses particularly site-specific characteristics to reduce risks and impacts. Overall, the identified SESs will help in recognizing local needs and gaps in existing policies and institutional arrangements, and the given methodological framework can be applied for the entire Himalayan region and for other mountain systems across the world.","[Kumar, Praveen; Joshi, P.

The present study explores, and tests alternative sampling technique based on spatial pattern characterization in the wake of increased landslide prediction efficacy, rather than a renowned random technique for training and testing sampling. Thereupon, landslide inventory data with 17 geo-environmental factors (i.e. topographic, hydrological and seismic factors) were determined. Landslide cluster patterns were confirmed by the Nearest Neighbor Index (NNI) method and after getting the cluster patterns, the predicted performance of landslide sampling was tested using ML and statistical methods. Advanced ML algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) and statistical methods including Weight-of-Evidence (WofE) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used and validated. The landslide-prone district of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (Neelum Valley), Kashmir Himalayas, Pakistan, was selected as a case study. Prediction performance rates are high with area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.802 to 0.912; accuracy (ACC) ranges from 0.78 to 0.89, and kappa ranges from 0.50 to 0.68 with cluster sampling technique, whereas the performance was low with random sampling technique, with AUC ranges from 0.768 to 0.895; ACC ranges from 0.74 to 0.86 and kappa ranges from 0.48 to 0.64. The descending order of accuracy of the six algorithms was XGboost, RF, KNN, NB, LR and WofE. Our results confirmed that the landslides followed cluster patterns in the study area, and ML algorithms with cluster training samples positively affected landslide susceptibility prediction with a statistically significant difference.

This study explores the potential of extended cultivation during winters using low-cost inputs by comparing different technological options for temperature retention for vegetable cultivation. It further demonstrates the role of peoples' participation in developing zero-energy artificial ice reservoirs (water harvesting technology through capturing and storing water in the form of ice) in winters to make water available in the following growing season. With site-specific modifications, an artificial ice reservoir was created by the villagers in 2020-21 which provided additional water for irrigation and was timely available (14 days in advance).

Thus, using Landsat data (MSS, ETM+ and TM), changes in glacier area, length, and debris cover have been delineated in the Baspa basin, which is a highly glacierized sub-basin of the Satluj River in the western Himalaya. Out of the total 109 glaciers inventoried through Landsat TM imagery (2011), 36 glaciers were found to be heavily debris covered (32.5 +/- 2.0%). A shrinkage in glacier area of 41.2 +/- 10.5 km(2) (i.e., 18.1 +/- 4.1%) at a rate of 1.18 +/- 0.3 km(2) a(-1) from 1976 (227.4 +/- 9.4 km(2)) to 2011 (186.2 +/- 3.7 km(2)) has been recorded. The overall glacier retreat studied for 33 glaciers varied from 3.3 +/- 0.03%, that is, 0.87 +/- 0.06 km at a rate of 17.2 +/- 1 m a(-1) to 30 +/- 6.6%, that is, 0.60 +/- 0.04 km at a rate of 24.8 +/- 0.2 m a-1. Consequently, the debris cover has increased by 23.5 +/- 1.4 km(2) (16.3 +/- 3.8%) from 1976 to 2011. Overall, the clean, small sized, low-altitude glaciers with south to southwest aspect and relatively steep slope have lost maximum area, which indicated a major control of these factors on the glacier changes. Simultaneously, a trend estimation of observed climatic data (1976/1985-2008) of three meteorological stations (Sangla, Rakcham, and Chitkul) using Mann Kendall test, Sen's Slope estimator and linear regression test revealed an increase in temperature and rainfall while a decline in snowfall. Importantly, the T-min has increased significantly at 95% confidence level during all the studied periods. The mean annual T-min and T-max indicated a rising trend at a rate of 0.076 and 0.071 degrees C a(-1). Thus, the changes in temperature and precipitation may be the major causes of accelerating the glacier ablation. The higher area changes (53.0 +/- 0.4%), of small glaciers <0.5 km(2) mark their sensitivity to climatic changes especially rising temperature. Under the warming climate, formation and progressive expansion of glacial lakes is expected because of the glacier recession in the basin. For instance, the Baspa Bamak Proglacial Lake at the snout of Baspa Bamak glacier has expanded continuously from 2000 onward.","[Mir, Riyaz Ahmad; Saraf, Arun K.] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttrakhand, India; [Mir, Riyaz Ahmad] Geol Survey India, State Unit Jammu & Kashmir, Opp Income Tax Off, Srinagar 190008, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Jain, Sanjay K.; Jain, Sharad K.; Thayyen, Renoj J.] Natl Inst Hydrol, Roorkee 247667, Uttrakhand, India",,"Mir, RA (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttrakhand, India.;Mir, RA (corresponding author), Geol Survey India, State Unit Jammu & Kashmir, Opp Income Tax Off, Srinagar 190008, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",riyazgsi@gmail.com,,,,,,,,36.0,36.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2017,49.0,4,,,,,621,647,,10.1657/AAAR0015-070,http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/AAAR0015-070,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000413931200008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Edward",,,Potential Effects of Ongoing and Proposed Hydropower Development on Terrestrial Biological Diversity in the Indian Himalaya,CONSERVATION BIOLOGY,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Indian Himalayan basins are earmarked for widespread dam building, but aggregate effects of these dams on terrestrial ecosystems are unknown. We mapped distribution of 292 dams (under construction and proposed) and projected effects of these dams on terrestrial ecosystems under different scenarios of land-cover loss. We analyzed land-cover data of the Himalayan valleys, where dams are located. We estimated dam density on fifth-through seventh-order rivers and compared these estimates with current global figures. We used a species-area relation model (SAR) to predict short-and long-term species extinctions driven by deforestation. We used scatter plots and correlation studies to analyze distribution patterns of species and dams and to reveal potential overlap between species-rich areas and dam sites. We investigated effects of disturbance on community structure of undisturbed forests. Nearly 90% of Indian Himalayan valleys would be affected by dam building and 27% of these dams would affect dense forests. Our model projected that 54,117 ha of forests would be submerged and 114,361 ha would be damaged by dam-related activities. A dam density of 0.3247/1000 km(2) would be nearly 62 times greater than current average global figures; the average of 1 dam for every 32 km of river channel would be 1.5 times higher than figures reported for U. S. rivers. Our results show that most dams would be located in species-rich areas of the Himalaya. The SAR model projected that by 2025, deforestation due to dam building would likely result in extinction of 22 angiosperm and 7 vertebrate taxa. Disturbance due to dam building would likely reduce tree species richness by 35%, tree density by 42%, and tree basal cover by 30% in dense forests. These results, combined with relatively weak national environmental impact assessment and implementation, point toward significant loss of species if all proposed dams in the Indian Himalaya are constructed.","[Pandit, Maharaj K.] Univ Delhi, Dept Environm Studies, Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies Mt & Hill Environm, Delhi 110007, India; [Pandit, Maharaj K.] Natl Univ Singapore, Univ Scholars Programme, Singapore 138593, Singapore; [Grumbine, R.

Carbon ('C') sequestering through agroforestry is one of the ways to mitigate the carbon reduction and provide safeguards to the environment for livelihood. The present study was conducted onGrewia optivatree which is dominated in agroforestry systems of Tehri Garhwal Himalaya (Uttarakhand) in different villages at three altitudes, i.e., upper altitudes (UA), middle altitude (MA), and lower altitude (LA) ranged from 500 to 1500 m amsl. Soil moisture, water holding capacity (WHC), bulk density (BD), and soil organic carbon (SOC) reported highest in LA compared to MA and UA, which might be because of all eroded material deposited in LA . Further, nitrogen storage in UA is higher due to comparatively low temperature significantly lower the microbial activities for N2O emission than MA and LA. The low nitogen in LA might be due to higher nitrification and/or denitrification rate. The same also supported by low carbon content (energy sources to microbial activity) in LA. The density ofGrewia optivain agroforestry was high in LA; however, total tree carbon was highest in MA (20.8 t/ha) followed by UA (20.4 t/ha) and LA (19.1 t/ha) while annual shoot carbon was highest in LA (2.43 t/ha) followed by MA (1.08 t/ha) and UA (0.77 t/ha). Further, carbon credit likely to be earned from the agroforestry underG. optivais estimated as 553,702 Euro.

The average annual runoff was found to be continuously increasing by the end of 21st century. The increase in precipitation as well as the streamflow for summer and winter in the NUIB indicated that RegCM4.3 simulated climate change projections were realistically transferred to HEC-HMS hydrological model. Maximum streamflow peaks, both in frequency and magnitude, were observed in July and August over three streamflow gauges (i.e. Besham, Nowshera and Khairabad) posing possible threats of flood risks during the monsoon season in Pakistan. Significant streamflow changes were projected for winter and spring seasons. The analysis of flow duration curve for three hydrometric stations indicates that the flow occurrence probability could be greater under both scenarios relative to the reference period. The increase in streamflow was projected under high (Q(5)) and medium (Q(50)) flow, which could possibly be related with the increase in monsoon precipitation events in the NUIB. Overall it is to be expected that the NUIB will confront more floods as a result of projected increase in medium and high flow, which demands better policies and management towards the water resources of the NUIB.

The parameters which are more crucial among these are a matter of scientific study and analysis. This research, taking Solan district, Himachal Pradesh, India, as the study area, aims to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on landslide susceptibility at a regional scale. Landslide distribution was characterized into two groups, namely Rainfall-Induced Landslide (RIL) and Human-Induced Landslide (HIL) based on triggering factors. Multiple data such as slope angle, aspect, profile curvature, distance to drainage, distance to lineament, lithology, distance to road, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use land cover (LULC) have been considered for delineating the landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ) map. The effect of anthropogenic activities on landslide occurrences has been examined through the distribution of landslides along national highways and land use land cover changes (LULCC). Two sets of LSZ maps with a LULC of time interval covering five years (2017 & 2021) were prepared to compare the temporal progression of LULC and landslide susceptibility during the five years. The results indicated the significant impact of anthropogenic activities on the landslide susceptibility. LSZ map of the year 2021 shows that 23% area falls into high and very high susceptible classes and 48% area falls into very low and low susceptibility classes. Compared to LSZ map of 2017, high and very high susceptible classes have been increased by 15%, whereas very low and low susceptible classes have been reduced by 7%. The present case study will help to understand the potential driving parameters responsible for HIL and also suggest the inclusion of LULC in landslide susceptibility analysis. The study will demonstrate new opportunities for research that could help decision-makers prepare for future disasters, both in the Indian Himalayan region and other areas.","[Sangeeta; Singh, S.

Here we report the assessment of alpine summit flora in Gulmarg Wildlife Sanctuary, Kashmir Himalaya. We employed a globally standardized Multi-Summit Approach and four spatially isolated summits spanning an elevation gradient of 210 m (between 3530-3740 m a.s.l.) from natural treeline to nival zone. Sampling of the summits was carried out in the year 2018 to collect floristic data together with records of soil temperature. A total of 142 vascular plant species were recorded in the sampled summits. Majority of the species were of herbaceous growth form and with perennial life span. Based on Raunkiaer's life form, hemicryptophytes were the most dominant followed by therophytes and phanerophytes. The summit flora showed the predominance of narrow-endemic species, with broad- and non-endemics declining with elevation. A significant relationship between growth form, Raunkiaer's life form, and the degree of endemism with elevation was observed. Both species diversity and soil temperature showed a monotonic decrease with increasing elevation. Interestingly, soil temperature clearly determined the magnitude of species diversity on the summits. Furthermore, based on floristic composition, the lowest summit had the highest dissimilarity with the rest of the summits.

The transported pollutants could pose a serious threat to the soil quality in the pristine regions at high elevations having minimal direct human influence. Therefore, it is important to understand the geochemical and physical characteristics of soils in this region and determine the extent of their chemical pollution. In order to achieve these objectives, soil samples were collected from different elevation transects of the Langtang Himalaya in Nepal. The samples were analyzed for PTEs and rare earth elements for the purpose of identifying their possible sources and to evaluate their environmental risk in the region. The PTEs and REEs concentrations were measured by ICP-MS (X-7; Thermo-elemental, USA) and total organic carbon (TOC) by TOC analyzer. The results of this study were comparable to those of the world average background soil as well as the Tibetan plateau surface soil. TOC revealed a decreasing trend with increasing elevation. Correlation analysis and principle component analysis (PCA) indicated that most of the elements were highly associated with major crustal elements, suggesting that their primary sources were of natural origin. Furthermore, the geo-accumulation index (I-geo), enrichment factor (EF) and pollution index (PI) analyses indicated that the Himalayan soils represent minimal pollution and the data from this study may be used as background values for the Himalayan region in the future studies. REEs in the soil samples were found to be consistent with an order of average abundance of the Earth's crust. In addition, the chondrite-normalized REE distribution of the light REE suggested enrichment of LREE and Eu depletion. Moreover, this study emphasized that soils of the Himalayan region could, in future, be under threat of elemental pollution from long-range transport via atmospheric circulation and deposition.","[Tripathee, Lekhendra; Kang, Shichang; Paudyal, Rukumesh] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Kang, Shichang; Zhang, Qianggong] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Tripathee, Lekhendra; Sharma, Chhatra Mani; Paudyal, Rukumesh] Himalayan Environm Res Inst, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Rupakheti, Dipesh; Zhang, Qianggong; Huang, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Bajracharya, Roshan Man; Sharma, Chhatra Mani; Gyawali, Ayush] Kathmandu Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Dhulikhel, Nepal; [Tripathee, Lekhendra; Sharma, Chhatra Mani; Huang, Jie; Sillanpaa, Mika] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Lab Green Chem, Sammonkatu 12, Mikkeli 50130, Finland",,"Kang, SC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Kang, SC (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",Shichang.kang@lzb.ac.cn,,,,,,,,41.0,42.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2016,75.0,19,,,,,,,1332,10.1007/s12665-016-6140-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-6140-1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000385135100033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Institutionalizing the climate change issue in national policies has now become an urgent need rather than a choice. As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Nepal has agreed to take climate change considerations into account in its national development agenda. The first step was the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol; the second is building the necessary institutional services such as a Designated National Authority (DNA), which is in the process of establishment. Moreover, climate change policies and strategies, the interconnections between different sectors, and coordination among different line ministries and government departments are issues to be addressed in the near future. WWF has initiated a Climate Witness Project to raise national and international awareness, and supports national efforts to shape adequate institutional responses to climate change.","WWF Nepal Program, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Rai, SC (corresponding author), WWF Nepal Program, POB 7660, Kathmandu, Nepal.",sandeep.rai@wwfnepal.org; aarati.gurung@wwfnepal.org,,,,,,,,12.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2005,25.0,4,,,,,316,320,,10.1659/0276-4741(2005)025[0316:RAOTIO]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/0276-4741(2005)025[0316:RAOTIO]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000234232200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Indian Himalayan ecosystem (IHE) is particularly susceptible and vulnerable to the effects of climate change. However, our understanding of how climate change affects the habitats of range-restricted and vulnerable avifauna in the IHE still needs to be improved. Hence, we employed ensemble species distribution modelling to examine the potential habitat shift of the cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichii) under climate change scenarios (representative concentration pathways, RCPs) i.e. RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5) by 2050 and 2070. The study revealed a noticeable expansion of climatically suitable habitats, indicating a shift towards higher altitudes that would become more favourable and suitable under future climates. The model predicted an area of very highly suitable habitat (1247.4 km(2)), followed by highly suitable (2747.9 km(2)), moderately suitable (4002.3 km(2)), low suitable (4952.2 km(2)) and rarely suitable (4236 km(2)) in the current scenario. The projection of larger areas was falling into the no change, followed by the high suitable and low suitable classes, for both the years 2050 and 2070 across all the RCPs. Furthermore, the projections indicated a consistent trend of increasing suitability for the cheer pheasant at higher elevations and a decline at lower elevations across RCPs for 2050 and 2070. Moreover, the mean diurnal temperature range was identified as the crucial driving factor, followed by isothermally and precipitation, influencing the species' shift towards suitable habitats at higher altitudes. The study can aid policymakers in developing effective conservation strategies to protect Himalayan range-restricted bird species in the face of climate change.","[Singh, Hukum; Kumar, Narendra; Kumar, Manoj] Forest Res Inst, PO New Forest, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India; [Singh, Ranjeet] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Itanagar 791113, Arunachal Prade, India",,"Singh, H (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst, PO New Forest, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India.",hukumsingh97@yahoo.com; narendra.physiol@gmail.com; ranaranjeet92@yahoo.com; manojfri@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2023,30.0,57,,,,,121224,121235,,10.1007/s11356-023-30789-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-30789-x,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001138053600076,View Full Record in Web of Science

Unsustainable agricultural activities increase the soil erosion rates and influence the overall hydro-geomorphic regime of river basins. Consequently, the water holding capacity of soil reduces, which enhances the flood risk in the lowland regions. In addition, excessive sediment flux severely affects the reservoir capacity in the mountainous regions, thus amplifying the flood hazard in the upland regions. Here, we have analysed two large and hydro-geomorphically diverse Himalayan River basins, namely, the Ganga Basin (GBA) from source to Allahabad in northern India and the Kosi Basin (KB) draining through Nepal and north Bihar plains in eastern India. Based on RULSE and region-specific SDR modelling framework, which includes model calibration, validation and uncertainty assessment, we demonstrate that spatial variation in rainfall, hydrogeomorphic conditions, the presence of hydraulic structures, and large-scale agricultural activities influence the overall pattern of sediment production and transport in these two large river basins. Total soil erosion in GBA and KB are estimated to be similar to 404 x 10(6) t/y and similar to 724 x 10(6) t/y respectively, a large part of which comes from the mountainous regions in both basins. Sediment yield at the mountain exits of the GBA and KB are computed as 14.1 x 10(6) t/y and 86.4 x 10(6) t/y respectively, which work out to be similar to 5% and similar to 15% of total soil erosion from the respective contributing areas of the KB and GBA respectively. Similarly, sediment yields at outlets in the alluvial plains are estimated to be 32.2 x 10(6) t/y and 37.3 x 10(6) t/y in the GBA and the KB, respectively suggesting that a large part of sediments are accommodated in the alluvial plains of KB.

However, there is high spatio-temporal uncertainty on those impacts linked to climate change uncertainty and the natural and anthropogenic interdependencies of water management systems. This study identifies current and future spatial patterns of fES production in a highly managed water resource system in northern India to inform the design and assessment of plausible adaptation measures to enhance fES production in the catchment under uncertain climate change. A water resource systems modelling approach is used to evaluate fES across the full range of plausible future scenarios, to identify the (worst-case) climate change scenarios triggering the greatest impacts and assess the capacity of adaptation to enhance fES. Results indicate that the current and future states of the fES depend on the spatial patterns of climate change and the impacts of infrastructure management on river flows. Natural zones deliver more regulating and cultural services than anthropized areas, although they are more climate-sensitive. The implementation of a plausible adaptation strategy only manages to slightly enhance fES in the system with respect to no adaptation. These results demonstrate that water resource systems models are powerful tools to capture complex system dependencies and inform the design of robust catchment management measures. They also highlight that mitigation and more ambitious adaptation strategies are needed to offset climate change impacts in highly climate-sensitive catchments.","[Momblanch, Andrea; Holman, Ian P.] Cranfield Univ, Cranfield, Beds, England; [Beevers, Lindsay] Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Srinivasalu, Pradeep; Kulkarni, Anil] Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bengaluru, India",,"Momblanch, A (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Cranfield, Beds, England.",andrea.momblanch-benavent@cranfield.ac.uk,,,,,,,,21.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2020,162.0,2,,,,,343,361,,10.1007/s10584-020-02795-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-020-02795-2,,AUG 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000563604300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adopting commercial flood models for replicating the dynamics of flood wave propagation over such regions is a major constraint due to the financial economics threaded to flood management. For the first instance, the present study attempts to investigate whether advanced open-source models are skillful in quantifying flood hazards and population exposure over moun-tainous terrains. While doing so, the performance of 1D-2D coupled HEC-RAS v6.3 (the most recent version developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) is reconnoitred for the first time in flood management literature. The most flood-prone region in Bhutan, the Chamkhar Chhu River Basin, housing large groups of communities and airports near its floodplains, is considered. HEC-RAS v6.3 setups are corroborated by comparing them with 2010 flood imagery derived from MODIS through performance metrics. The results indicate a sizable portion of the central part of the basin experiences very-high flood hazards with depth and velocities exceeding 3 m, and 1.6 m/s, respectively, during 50, 100, and 200-year return periods of floods. To affirm HEC-RAS, the flood hazards are compared with TUFLOW at 1D and 1D-2D coupled levels. The hydrological similarity within the channel is reflected at river cross-sections (NSE and KGE > 0.98), while overland inundation and hazard statistics differ, however, very less significant (<10 %). Later, flood hazards extracted from HEC-RAS are fused with the World-Pop population to estimate the degree of population exposure. The study ascertains that HEC-RAS v6.3 is an efficacious option for flood risk mapping over geographically arduous regions and can be preferred in resource-constrained environments ensuring a minimal degree of anomaly.","[Namgyal, Trashi; Thakur, Dev Anand; Mohanty, Mohit Prakash] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Water Resources Dev & Management, Roorkee 247667, India; [Namgyal, Trashi] Royal Govt Bhutan, Natl Ctr Hydrol & Meteorol, Thimphu, Bhutan; [Rishi, D.

However, dramatic Pleistocene climatic oscillations could also lead to species turnover but have widely been ignored. Here, we used ecological niche modelling (ENM) of 288 passerine species in the Himalayas to test the effect of climate change during the Last Interglacial Period (LIG), the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the present day. The ENM analyses hindcasted species persistence through climate change from the LGM to the present day but likely showed a high degree of species turnover (e.g. 32.6-46.2%) from the LIG to the LGM. Further elevational dynamic reconstructions demonstrated that species might survive these two periods of climate change by upward and downward shifts, respectively. Statistical analyses of climatic variables showed increased climatic variability in the Himalayas during the LIG, which might have caused community turnover. The severe evolutionary consequence of the LIG climate in the Himalayas contrasts with the paradigm of the climatic optimum in Europe and North America and suggests potential geography-dependent effects of past climate change.

Monitoring the spatiotemporal distribution of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) accurately and quantifying its response to climate change are indispensable sources of information for sustainably managing grassland ecosystems in the HKH region. In this study, a pure vegetation index model (PVIM) was applied to estimate the long-term dynamics of grassland AGB in the HKH region during 2000-2018. We further quantified the response of grassland AGB to climate change (temperature and precipitation) by partial correlation and variance partitioning analyses and then compared their differences with elevation. Our results demonstrated that the grassland AGB predicted by the PVIM had a good linear relationship with the ground sampling data. The grassland AGB distribution pattern showed a decreasing trend from east to west across the HKH region except in the southern Himalayas. From 2000 to 2018, the mean AGB of the HKH region increased at a rate of 1.57 g/(m(2)center dot yr) and ranged from 252.9 (2000) to 307.8 g/m(2) (2018). AGB had a positive correlation with precipitation in more than 80% of the grassland, and temperature was positively correlated with AGB in approximately half of the region. The change in grassland AGB was more responsive to the cumulative effect of annual precipitation, while it was more sensitive to the change in temperature in the growing season; in addition, the influence of climate varied at different elevations. Moreover, compared with that of temperature, the contribution of precipitation to grassland AGB change was greater in approximately 60% of the grassland, but the differences in the contribution for each climate factor were small between the two temporal scales at elevations over 2000 m. An accurate assessment of the temporal and spatial distributions of grassland AGB and the quantification of its response to climate change are of great significance for grassland management and sustainable development in the HKH region.","[Xu Cong; Zhao Dan; Yan Nana; Zeng Yuan] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Xu Cong; Zhao Dan; Zeng Yuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Liu Wenjun] Yunnan Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm Sci, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Liu Wenjun] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Plateau Mt Ecol & Restorat Degrade, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Hao Yanbin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hao Yanbin] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Hao Yanbin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Yanshan Earth Crit Zone, Natl Res Stn, Beijing 101408, Peoples R China; [Xia Anquan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, D (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Zhao, D (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhaodan@aircas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,3.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,32.0,5,,,,,759,775,,10.1007/s11769-022-1299-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-022-1299-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000850588200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study was undertaken to forecast and quantify the potential streamflow response to climate change in the Jhelum River basin. The implications of air temperature trends (+0.11A degrees C/decade) reported for the entire north-west Himalaya for past century and the regional warming (+0.7A degrees C/decade) trends of three observatories analyzed between last two decades were used for future projection of snow cover depletion and stream flow. The streamflow was simulated and validated for the year 2007-2008 using snowmelt runoff model (SRM) based on in-situ temperature and precipitation with remotely sensed snow cover area. The simulation was repeated using higher values of temperature and modified snow cover depletion curves according to the assumed future climate. Early snow cover depletion was observed in the basin in response to warmer climate. The results show that with the increase in air temperature, streamflow pattern of Jhelum will be severely affected. Significant redistribution of streamflow was observed in both the scenarios. Higher discharge was observed during spring-summer months due to early snowmelt contribution with water deficit during monsoon months. Discharge increased by 5%-40% during the months of March to May in 2030 and 2050. The magnitude of impact of air temperature is higher in the scenario-2 based on regional warming. The inferences pertaining to change in future streamflow pattern can facilitate long term decisions and planning concerning hydro-power potential, water resource management and flood hazard mapping in the region.","[Sharma, Vaibhav; Mishra, Varunendra Dutta] Snow & Avalanche Study Estab, Chandigarh 160036, India; [Joshi, Pawan Kumar] TERI Univ, Inst Area, Delhi 110070, India",,"Sharma, V (corresponding author), Snow & Avalanche Study Estab, Chandigarh 160036, India.",vaibhavsharma51@gmail.com,,,,,,,,21.0,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2013,10.0,4,,,,,574,587,,10.1007/s11629-013-2667-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-013-2667-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000322392800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, as vulnerability varies spatially and is effected by the bio-geographical conditions, the information on vulnerability distribution among the different biogeographic zones (BZs) is of value. This study aims to assess impact of social and ecological dimensions on vulnerability of agricultural communities in different biogeographical zones of Himalaya. Inherent vulnerability in different BZs was assessed at village level by performing hierarchal additive clustering. A total of 39 indicators (16 for ecological and 23 for social) were considered and weighed by Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP). The spatial distribution of different vulnerability indices was analyzed by Global and Local Moran's Index. The results show presence of very high social vulnerability (0.71 +/- 0.11) for middle Himalayas (BZ2) and higher ecological vulnerability (0.68 +/- 0.13) for lower Himalayas (BZ1). Among the different zones, middle Himalayas (BZ2) shows the maximum inherent vulnerability.

Although there are studies on the occurrence of few invasive species in the Himalayan ecosystems, systematic information on their intensity of spread and species association is still missing. Considering existing data gaps, we aimed to assess the intensity of spread and distribution pattern of A. adenophora, one of the high-concern invasive species (HiCIS) of India that is causing havoc in the Himalayas, across an elevational gradient. Field data were collected in 2018 and 2021 in the Indian federal state of Sikkim, located in the Eastern Himalayas. We analyzed the population status and species association of A. adenophora along an elevational gradient ranging from > 600 m to 2700 m above sea level, which was divided into seven gradients of 300 m width, and each gradient was further randomly sampled. Overall, 81 species were present in association with A. adenophora, including 58 herbs, 19 shrubs, and 4 climbers, belonging to 30 families and 67 genera in the region. No other species continuously co-occurred along with A. adenophora throughout the elevation ranging from > 600 m to 2700 m. The species observed increased frequency (100%), density (40.51 ind./100 m(2)), and basal cover (11.25 cm(2)/m(2)) in the elevational gradient 1500-1800 m in 2018. In 2021, A. adenophora dominated the highest elevational gradient (< 2400-2700 m) with increased frequency (99.96%), density (58.41 ind./100m(2)), and basal cover (42.54 cm(2)/100m(2)), which demonstrated rapid invasion and improved plant health and reproductive vigor in comparison to the lower elevational gradient in Sikkim Himalaya. Despite being completely absent at the highest elevation (< 2400-2700 m), in 2018, it observed gregarious spread at the highest elevation in 2021, which is of serious concern to ecologists. The presence of the targeted species in all seven studied altitudinal gradients reflects stage III of the species invasion. An enormous shift in the distribution pattern along elevational gradients within a short time span is alarming for the Himalayan ecosystem since it is becoming a thriving habitat for invasive species owing to anthropogenic activity. We mapped the potential geographical extent using the species distribution model (SDM) and predicted the suitable habitat of distribution in Sikkim Himalaya. In order to curtail the spread and counteract the negative impact of this species on native vegetation in Sikkim Himalaya and ultimately reverse the process, local and regional initiatives for its biological control and management must be taken.","[Verma, Anil Kumar; Manika, N.; Behera, Soumit Kumar] CSIR Natl Bot Res Inst, Plant Ecol & Climate Change Sci Div, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Nayak, Rashmi; Chaudhary, Lal Babu] CSIR Natl Bot Res Inst, Plant Divers Systemat & Herbarium Div, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Manika, N.] Int Union Conservat Nat IUCN, Commiss Ecosyst Management CEM, CH-1196 Gland, Switzerland; [Bargali, Kiran] Kumaun Univ, Dept Bot, Naini Tal 263001, Uttarakhand, India; [Pandey, Vashist Narayan] Gorakhpur Univ, Dept Bot, Gorakhpur 273009, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Behera, SK (corresponding author), CSIR Natl Bot Res Inst, Plant Ecol & Climate Change Sci Div, Rana Pratap Marg, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",soumitkbehera@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2023,195.0,1,,,,,,,152,10.1007/s10661-022-10549-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10549-z,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000888808700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

HYSPLIT model was used to track the air mass sources at a 7-day time-step from September 1, 2014, to September 28, 2014, over the selected region. All nine glaciers revealed high recession as indicated by changes in the area (average recession: 20.8%) and snout position (similar to 14 m a(-1)). The relative percentage of debris on each glacier varied between similar to 0% (clean glacier) and 43%. Although the investigated glaciers lie in the same climatological regime, their topographical behavior is dissimilar with mean altitude ranging between 4000 and similar to 4700 m asl and the average slope varying from 17 to 24 degrees. All the investigated glaciers are north-facing except G3 (southerly aspect). Our results indicate anomalously high ambient BC concentrations, ranging from 500 to 1364 ng m(-3), at the glacier sites, higher than previously studied for glaciers in the Himalayas and neighboring Tibetan Plateau. The backward air-mass trajectory modeling indicated both local and global sources of particulate matter in the study area.

Therefore, in the present study, the landslide susceptibility mapping was conducted along Rishikesh-Badrinath national highway, using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM). Prior to performing landslide susceptibility mapping, a landslide inventory was prepared using high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery along with Google Earth image. In all total 156 landslides adjacent to the highway were identified and mapped in 2022. Afterwards, relative weights were assigned to a host of nine controlling and triggering factors using AHP. Subsequently, each factor was reclassified and converted to thematic layer and finally overlaid in the GIS environment for the generation of landslide susceptibility map. Furthermore, the generated landslide susceptibility map was validated with the landslide inventory of the region. Consequently, the validation revealed an AUC value of 0.81. Later, the created landslide susceptibility map was classified in five sub-classes of very low, low, moderate, high, and very high landslide susceptible zone. About 27% of the area was found to be highly landslide susceptible. This section is characterized with high slope and rainfall. The current study offers a comprehensive identification of landslide susceptible zones along Rishikesh-Badrinath national highway. The landslide susceptible zone map of this area may help in the preparedness and development of various mitigation plans for making disaster governance better. Additionally, landslide susceptibility map could be used as a guideline for the formulation of disaster management plan to avoid loss and reduce risk to landslide by the concerned authority.

The locations of existing landslides were detected by general field surveys and relevant records. 220 previous landslide locations were obtained, presented as an inventory map, and divided into four folds to calibrate and authenticate the models. For modelling the landslide susceptibility, twelve LCFs (landslide conditioning factors) were used. Two statistical methods, i.e. the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root mean square error (RMSE), one statistical test, i.e. the Freidman rank test, as well as the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), efficiency and precision were used for authenticating the produced landslide models. The results of the accuracy measures revealed that all models have good potential to recognize the landslide susceptibility in the Garhwal Himalayan region. Among these models, the ensemble model achieved a higher accuracy (precision: 0.829, efficiency: 0.833, AUC: 89.460, RMSE: 0.069 and MAE: 0.141) than the individual models. According to the outcome of the ensemble simulations, the BRT model's predictive accuracy was enhanced by integrating it with the statistical model (CP).

Lack of data and concepts to monitor and manage the potential effects of climate change on freshwater biota is particularly evident in developing countries. Many of the highest and longest mountain systems are found in these regions and provide fundamental water-based services to these countries. The climate sensitive zone (CSZ) concept is based upon changes in community composition along altitudinal gradients that serve as a proxy for climatic gradients. The CSZ characterizes a community of climatically sensitive biota that is likely to react quickly to climate change. We present a framework on how the CSZ can be adapted to and implemented in streams, and demonstrate its applicability for central Himalayan streams of Nepal. We sampled and analyzed benthic invertebrate communities of 58 central Himalayan streams along altitudinal gradients from 1500 to 4500 m asl. A generalized linear model identified altitude as the only significant, albeit indirect, variable explaining benthic invertebrate composition. We applied species turnover scores and threshold indicator taxon analysis (TITAN) to identify the CSZ in central Himalayan streams along the extensive altitudinal gradients. An altitudinal band between 2900 and 3500 m was identified as CSZ and was characterized by 33 indicator taxa. Identifying CSZs in streams can help prioritize resources for monitoring climate change impacts in running waters and help pinpoint stream reaches suitable for testing the efficacy of climate change-directed mitigation practices.","[Shah, Ram Devi Tachamo; Haase, Peter; Jaehnig, Sonja C.; Pauls, Steffen U.] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Shah, Ram Devi Tachamo; Haase, Peter; Jaehnig, Sonja C.] Senckenberg Res Inst, Dept River Ecol & Conservat, D-63571 Gelnhausen, Germany; [Shah, Ram Devi Tachamo; Haase, Peter; Jaehnig, Sonja C.] Nat Hist Museum, D-63571 Gelnhausen, Germany; [Sharma, Subodh] Kathmandu Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Jaehnig, Sonja C.] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Dept Ecosyst Res, D-12587 Berlin, Germany",,"Shah, RDT (corresponding author), Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr BiK F, Senckenberganlage 25, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany.",ramdevishah@yahoo.com; subodh.sharma@ku.edu.np; peter.haase@senckenberg.de; sonja.jaehnig@igb-berlin.de; steffen.pauls@senckenberg.de,,,,,,,,25.0,28.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2015,132.0,2,,,,,265,278,,10.1007/s10584-015-1417-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1417-z,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000360541800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

We estimated SOC stock of chir pine forests along an altitudinal gradient at three soil depths (0-30, 30-60 and 60-100 cm) in the Garhwal Himalaya, Uttarakhand. Fourteen forest stands at four altitudes, viz., <1000 m above sea level (m asl), 1001-1400 m asl, 1401-1800 m asl and >1801 m asl were surveyed and served for data collection. A model for predicting SOC was developed through stepwise regression analysis based on vegetation information and altitude as independent variables with the field data on SOC. For vegetation information, we used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measured through remote sensing (RS). The mean SOC stock up to 100 cm depth was increased with increasing altitude and were in the order of 69.66 +/- 19.86, 85.27 +/- 17.53, 95.68 +/- 7.90 and 148.41 +/- 71.39 million g ha(-1) (million gram per hectare) for <1000, 1001-1400, 1401-1800 and >1801 m_asl, respectively. The result showed that NDVI was a good predictor for SOC estimation. The model predicted SOC stock between 57 and 152 million g ha(-1) with a mean of 93 million g ha(-1), which was close to the SOCs from field inventory. Therefore, RS could be used to precisely map the SOC stock in the chir pine forests of the Himalayas through NDVI and provide information to policymakers for forest management.","[Kumar, Munesh; Kumar, Rahul; Konsam, Bobbymoore] HNB Garhwal Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Srinagar, Garhwal, India; [Kumar, Amit] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Thakur, Tarun Kumar] Indira Gandhi Natl Tribal Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Amarkantak, India; [Sahoo, Uttam Kumar] Mizoram Univ, Dept Forestry, Aizawl, India; [Pandey, Rajiv] ICFRE, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India",,"Kumar, M (corresponding author), HNB Garhwal Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Srinagar, Garhwal, India.;Kumar, A (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",muneshmzu@yahoo.com; amitkdah@nuist.edu.cn,,,,,,,,15.0,15.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2022,33.0,17,,,,,3387,3400,,10.1002/ldr.4393,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4393,,JUL 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000826386500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These processes of mass movement and landslides have been constantly modifying the landscape. Landslides are one of the indicators of the geomorphological modification taking place in this active and fragile terrain. This work is aimed at providing another example of landslide susceptibility mapping based on geological and geomorphological attributes. The data collected from aerial photographs, topographic sheets and the image suggests that there is a correlation between the distribution of landslides and some of the geological and geomorphological factors, for example, the distance from an active fault, relative relief and slope. Parameters like factor of safety, altitude, relief, slope and the distance from the fault lineament have been included in the study. A rating system has been applied to the factor for arriving at a quantitative estimate of landslide susceptibility for each physiographic unit. Since terrain classification forms the foundation of this work, the entire study can be grouped into two sequential activities: (1) the terrain classification and (2) landslide susceptibility mapping. The result is the landslide susceptibility zoning map presented. The landslides have not been classified with respect to time and may represent the final result of the on-going geological, geomorphological and seismic activity since the Holocene period or late Pleistocene time when the glaciers retreated.

However, factors influencing the Slope Environmental Lapse Rate (SELR) of temperature along the Himalayan mountain slopes and an appropriate modeling solution remain as a key knowledge gaps. The present study evaulates the SELR variations in the monsoon regime of the western Himalaya and proposes a modeling solution for the valley scale SELR assessment. SELR of selected station pairs in the Sutlej and Beas basins ranging between the elevation of 662-3,130 m a.s.l. and that of Garhwal Himalaya between 770 and 3,820 rn a.s.l. were assessed in this study. Results suggest that the moisture-temperature interplay is not only forcing the seasonal variations, but also the elevation-depended variability of the temperature SELR. Temperature lapse rate constrianed to the nival-glacier regime is found to be comparable to the saturated adiabatic lapse rate (SALR) and lower than the valley scale SELR. The study also suggests that the bi-modal pattern of the annual temperature lapse rates earlier observed in the Nepal Himalaya is extended up to upper Ganga, Sutlej, and Beas basins in the western Himalaya. This seasonal variability of SELR is found to be closly linked with the seasonal variations in the lifting condensation levels (LCLs) over the region. Inter-annual variation in SELR of the nival-glacier regime are found to be significant while that of the valley scale SELR are more stable. We propose a simple preliminary but robust model ho/de/ivioA the valley scale SELR of monsoon regime modifying the equation governing pseudo adiabatic lapse rate. The SELR modeling solution is achieved by deriving monthly SELR indices using the data of two station pairs in the Sutlej and Beas basins during the 1986-2005 period through K-fold cross validation. The model sucessfully captures seasonal SELR variations, and was tested compared to the station pairs in the upper Ganga basin as well and showed significant improvement over the standard environmental lapse rate of 6.5 K/km.","[Thayyen, Renoj J.] Natl Inst Hydrol, Water Resources Syst Div, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Dimri, Ashok P.] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi, India",,"Thayyen, RJ (corresponding author), Natl Inst Hydrol, Water Resources Syst Div, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India.",renojthayyen@gmail.com,,,,,,,,25.0,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 5,2018,6.0,,,,,,,,42,10.3389/fenvs.2018.00042,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2018.00042,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000452122000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, some of the most pressing issues fundamental to the existence of springs is their monitoring and management because of their geological, ecological, scientific, cultural, religious and societal importance. Despite the key role that they play, springs are today continuously facing various types of threats. Springs have attained recently an extraordinary importance as they play role in providing drinking water, irrigation, sustaining habitats for fisheries, aquatic biodiversity, endemism, spiritual enrichment, recreation, aesthetics etc. especially in scenario of climate change threat predicted for Himalayas. In this backdrop a study directed to assess water quality status and potential of springs to offer the solution to ever-increasing water shortages was carried out. Identification of main threats to spring ecosystems and their subsequent monitoring and management in Kashmir Himalaya has been pleaded in this article. Major research highlights of the work revealed very well to excellent water quality class and Piper trilinear diagram of spring water depicted Ca-Mg-HCO3 water type. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) revealed significant variations whilst Principal Component Analysis (PCA) generated four principal components (PC1, PC2, PC3 and PC4) with higher Eigen values of 1.0 or more (1.4-9.5) accounting for 34.34, 30.03, 18.50 and 12.4% of the total variance respectively. Consequently, majority of the physico-chemical parameters (95.28%) loaded under PC1 and PC2 were having strong positive loading (>0.60) and are mainly responsible for regulating the hydrochemistry of spring waters.

The resource dependency of village communities in the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary Landscape was studied through a questionnaire survey in 10 villages situated along an elevational gradient. Vegetation sampling was done in government-owned sanctuary forests and community-owned forests, both visited by villagers. Forest community composition, regeneration status, and tree population structure were studied to understand the impact of disturbance on forests and their resistance to anthropogenic alterations. Results indicated a reduction in both fuelwood and fodder consumption with decreasing elevation, with villages at higher elevations and located inside the sanctuary depending more on forest resources. Forests showed evidence of disturbance in the form of lower basal cover, mean canopy cover, regeneration, and disturbance-influenced distribution of shrubs. However, despite the signs of secondary succession, Quercus leucotrichophora forest has retained the original tree species composition. Vegetation recovery on 3 landslide sites at varying successional stages was also studied. The old successional site had higher species richness than early successional sites. The only tree species with adult individuals recorded in early successional sites was Alnus nepalensis, an early successional nitrogen-fixing species. The community composition of the old successional site, at Bandwara, included young individuals of Q. leucotrichophora, the climax species of forests in that elevational range. The current forest structure of both disturbed forest and vegetation recovery on the old succession site indicate the resilient dynamism of native Himalayan forests. Considering the role of mountain forests in achieving sustainable development, it is imperative to study the dynamics of changes in forest community and structure in response to increasing human pressure and climate change impacts.","[Manral, Upma; Badola, Ruchi; Hussain, Syed Ainul] Wildlife Inst India, Post Box 18, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India",,"Badola, R (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, Post Box 18, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India.",ruchi@wii.gov.in,,,,,,,,8.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2017,37.0,3,,,,,310,322,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-16-00109.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-16-00109.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000411812900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study assessed area changes, frontal retreat, and geodetic mass balance of Machoi Glacier interspersed between the Greater Himalayan mountain range of Kashmir and Zanskar from 1972 to 2019. Further, the cryoconite, albedo, aerosol variability, and sediments in glacier ice were studied to correlate them with glacier recession. The glacier has lost an area of similar to 1.88 km(2) (similar to 29%) from 1972 to 2019 with a frontal retreat of 500 mat a rate of 10.6 ma(-1). The geodetic mass balance analysis shows that the glacier surface lowered by 43.7 m losing 0.215 Gt from 2000 to 2011. The cryoconite holes on the glacier are mostly present in the ablation part having an average diameter of 5-7 cm. Both cryoconite holes and light-absorbing impurities in glacier ice show an inverse relation with altitude. Analysis of albedo data indicated no trend for the glacier, however, an insignificant decreasing trend was observed for the ablation zone of the glacier. The seasonal trends of albedo indicated a decrease during winter. The reanalysis data about aerosols indicated a significantly increasing trend from 1980 to 2018 and a decreased concentration in 2019 and 2020 owing to the prevailing COVID19 scenario. The receding glaciers in the region can severely impact the streamflow regimes, hydropower generation, and agriculture production in the region. However, more detailed in-situ data about glacier albedo, lithology, biophysical and chemical characterization of cryoconite holes, anthropogenic footprint and associated aerosol deposition needs to be generated to precisely ascertain their influence on glacier dynamics.

Semiarid rangelands are especially susceptible to degradation, which challenges wildlife conservation and human livelihoods that depend on livestock production. In the cold-arid Trans-Himalayan ecosystem (northern India), temperature is increasing, and it is also becoming progressively wetter. Yet, counter-intuitively, there are widespread concerns over degradation. We evaluated whether greening/browning patterns in long-term satellite-derived vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI]) are consistent across different spatial and temporal scales using 6 datasets: MODIS (250m, 500m, 1km, and 5.5km), SPOT 1km, and GIMMS 8km. Results indicate browning in the spring and greening in late summer. Location of hotspots of degradation (browning) was broadly consistent across spatial scales (10(-2)-10(2)km(2)) and were found in regions with warmer temperature and at higher elevations. Broadly, the spatial/temporal pattern of browning does not coincide strongly with location and timing of human land use via livestock grazing. This geographical and seasonal context indicates that vegetation response may be more strongly related to climate than to human land use (overgrazing). Importantly, the dynamic nature of greening/browning, across space and time, is not captured by composite annual metrics (sum-NDVI, max-NDVI, and mean-NDVI). This reiterates the importance of both intraannual and interannual assessments. Location of hotspots indicates that degradation occurs in a spatially contiguous manner, but these are not stationary and instead shift with seasons. Overall, the results show that evaluating the consistency of greening/browning trends across different spatial/temporal scales is critical for understanding and managing vegetation degradation.","[Murthy, Karthik; Bagchi, Sumanta] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India",,"Bagchi, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Ecol Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.",sbagchi@iisc.ac.in,,,,,,,,23.0,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2018,29.0,8,,,,,2485,2495,,10.1002/ldr.3019,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.3019,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000441249100022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Majority of the studies reporting shifts in plant phenology are available from the North America and Europe and largely scarce from the developing world, including the Himalaya; and studies integrating multiple methodological approaches to investigate the climate-driven phenological shifts are too rare. Here, we report the shifts in spring flowering phenology of model plant species, Sternbergia vernalis in response to the changing climate in Kashmir Himalaya, by integrating decadal field observational records with long-term herbarium and dated-photograph data, and supported with experimental evidences. Our results revealed a significant increasing trend of 0.038, 0.016 and 0.023 degrees C/year in the annual mean maximum temperature (Tmax), mean minimum temperature (Tmin) and diurnal temperature range (DTR) respectively; but an insignificant decreasing trend in annual precipitation of -1.24 mm/year over the last four decades (1980-2019) in this Himalayan region. The flowering phenology of S. vernalis has significantly advanced by 11.8 days/degrees C and 27.8 days/degrees C increase in Tmax and Tmin respectively, indicating that the climate warming has led to substantial shifts in flowering phenology of the model plant species. We also observed a strong association of seasonal Tmax (December-February) and DTR on the early onset of spring flowering, however precipitation had no significant effect on the timing of flowering. The greenhouse experiment results further supported a significant effect of temperature in triggering the phenological shifts, wherein the model plant grown under different temperature treatments flowered 9-20 days earlier compared to the control. Our study showcases the integrated use of multiple methodological approaches for unravelling the long-term phenological shifts in response to climate change, and contributes in filling the knowledge gaps in the phenological research from the developing world in general and the Himalaya in particular.

However, the impact on fluvial geomorphology has not received specific attention. Change in the glacial domain in terms of melt increase will change discharge and sediment flux into fluvial system, which will induce changes in fluvial processes and forms. The present work attempts to study this process-based glacio-fluvial coupling in the two neighbouring glaciated river basins in the Northwest Himalaya, viz., the Sutlej and the Yamuna river basins till the mountain front. A total of 194 samples of river, tributary and groundwater of pre-and post-monsoon seasons in the two river basins were analysed for stable isotopes. The trend of delta O-18 and electrical conductivity along the mainstream gives qualitative idea on the influence of headwaters in the downstream of the catchment thereby allowing inference on melt contribution. Further, two component mixing model using stable oxygen isotope of two seasons water samples showed that melt contributes about 41.1-66.8 and 6.6-10.6% at different points to the total river discharge in the Sutlej and the Tons River (the glaciated, major tributary of the Yamuna River) basins, respectively. For different scenarios of increase in melt, stream power increase in the Sutlej River basin is significant as opposed to the Tons River. River channel in the Sutlej River basin will be significantly more impacted in comparison with the Yamuna River system.","[Varay, L. Sardine; Singh, S.

Risks associated with landslides increase every year due to frequent occurrences of extreme events like torrential rainfall, snowmelt, cloud bursts and flash floods demanding sustainable and environment friendly techniques/interventions to prevent and control landslides. Despite the availability of many techniques to improve the stability of slopes solutions that aim at sustainable development are not popular and lack thorough investigation. This study deliberates the choice of biotechnical stabilization of slopes by vegetating them with suitable endemic green cover that will help in not only improving the stability of the slopes against landslides but will also enrich the environment and prevent permanent modification of the soil environment. The option of vegetating the slopes can be a long-lasting solution with minimal maintenance as they mimic the natural system. Also, it is a way forward in preserving the endemic flora in the susceptible regions as landslides also lead to large scale environmental degradation. Many native species are capable of providing good stability to the slope through root cohesion leads to protecting the native species in the region. Vegetative cover also controls the hydrology of the slope which is a major triggering factor of landslides. This is also an economic option as it does not involve large scale investment in construction like retaining walls or dewatering systems.","[Sujatha, E.

This is especially important in the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), where poverty and vulnerability are high and climate change impacts on the cryosphere are strong. However, there is a lack of synthesized knowledge about the contributions of the cryosphere to high mountain communities. This paper uses a cryosphere service frameworka derivative of the ecosystem service conceptto classify different goods and services provided by the cryosphere. Case studies were selected using an adapted systematic review methodology. These studies were then synthesized and examined through the lens of critical political ecology. The review shows that while the cryosphere provides a whole range of goods and services for mountain communities, not all of these are well documented. Material services like the supply of water for irrigation and agriculture, and disservices such as disasters, are better documented than non-material services like the spirituality of landscapes. The majority of the case studies do not use an interdisciplinary lens. While some studies on irrigation discuss the physical basis and human organization of irrigation, the literature on disasters mostly focuses on the physical processes and at most generalized loss and damage assessments. Further, most case studies do not use the critical epistemologies needed to examine how politics, power, and intersectionality influence societal responses to changes in the cryosphere. The paper suggests that future studies adopt interdisciplinary collaboration to understand human impacts and adaptive responses through critical political ecology frameworks.","[Mukherji, Aditi; Sinisalo, Anna] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Nuesser, Marcus] Heidelberg Univ, South Asia Inst, Dept Geog, Heidelberg, Germany; [Garrard, Rodney] Univ Bern, Inst Geog, Bern, Switzerland; [Eriksson, Mats] Stockholm Int Water Inst SIWI, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Mukherji, A (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.",aditimukheriji15@gmail.com; Anna.Sinisalo@icimod.org; marcus.nuesser@uni-heidelberg.de; garrand.rodney@gmail.com; mgi_eriksson@yahoo.se,,,,,,,,50.0,53.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2019,19.0,5,,,SI,,1311,1326,,10.1007/s10113-019-01484-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-019-01484-w,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000468851600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The village-level data were normalized and combined to represent climate change impacts and the dimension of vulnerability. The IPCC (2014) protocol was used to assess forest vulnerability. The highest vulnerability was recorded in Zone 'B', and higher sensitivity, higher climate change impacts, and lower adaptive capacities were recorded in Zone 'B' and 'C'. The approach is comparable within the district and between the states.

Studies in various Indian cities in hilly terrains have highlighted serious concerns about existing construction practices. Lack of adequate planning and design has resulted in haphazard development in hilly regions. This state-of-the-art review investigates the factors that influence the structural performance of buildings on slopes while explaining reasons that have caused enormous damages and even collapse of hill buildings in the recent earthquake events. The work discusses building configurations, comparison of various vital building regulations, the major problems encountered in building stocks and associated structural deficiencies on hill slopes. The significance of intensification of earthquake-related losses due to soil amplification has been well documented in the past. Insights from experimental and numerical studies focusing on impacts of topographical and geological factors on damage amplification of hillside buildings are fetched, the results of which are in good corroboration with the findings of post-earthquake surveys and reviews. This study establishes that a higher slope gradient necessitates more slope cutting than a lower slope gradient to get the same building footprint, and many times, this value exceeds the permissible height of slope cutting given in existing building byelaws. Such excessive slope cutting makes the slope weak and unstable. Recommendations and solutions to help enhance structural resilience, reduce disproportionate damages and mitigate failure of hill buildings have been delineated.","[Roshan, Prateek; Pal, Shilpa] Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi, India",,"Pal, S (corresponding author), Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi, India.",prateek_2k19phdce02@dtu.ac.in; shilpapal@dtu.ac.in,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2023,30.0,44,,,,,99100,99126,,10.1007/s11356-022-23263-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-23263-7,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000863555900012,View Full Record in Web of Science

LAI plays an essential role in forest cover monitoring and has been identified as one of the important climate variables. However, due to challenges in field sampling, complex topography, and availability of cloud-free optical satellite data, LAI assessment on larger scale is still unexplored in the Sikkim Himalayan area. We used two optical instruments, digital hemispherical photography (DHP) and LAI-2200C, to assess the LAI across four different forests following 20 x 20 m(2) elementary sampling units (ESUs) in the Himalayan state of Sikkim, India. The use of Sentinel-2 derived vegetation indices (VIs) demonstrated a better correlation with the DHP based LAI estimates than using LAI-2200C. Further, the combination of both reflectance bands and VIs were integrated to predict the LAI maps using random forest model. The temperate evergreen forests demonstrated the highest LAI value, while the predicted maps exhibited LAI maxima of 3.4. The estimated vs predicted LAI for DHP and LAI-2200C based estimation demonstrated reasonably good (R-2 = 0.63 and R-2 = 0.68, respectively) agreement. Further, improvements on the LAI prediction can be attempted by minimizing errors from the inherent field protocols, optimizing the density of field measurements, and representing heterogeneity. The recent rise of frequent forest fires in Sikkim Himalaya prompts for better understanding of fuel load in terms of surface fuel or canopy fuel that can be linked to LAI. The high-resolution LAI map could serve as input to forest fuel bed characterization, especially in seasonal forests with significant variations in green leaves and litter, thereby offering inputs for forest management in changing climate.","[Mudi, Sujoy; Paramanik, Somnath; Behera, Mukunda Dev; Prakash, A.

However, the landslide has been a significant environmental hazard problem during the last five years due to extreme torrential rainstorms. For this regard, a geographic information system (GIS) database was established, which contains 170 landslide polygons that occurred during the last five years and ten influencing factors. The database was used for training and validating the ICA-NeuralNet model. The results showed that the integrated model achieves high performance with classification accuracy rates of 82.4% on the training dataset and 78.2% on the testing dataset.

Therefore, hydrological modeling considering TLAPS and PLAPS is crucial to manage the water resources in these terrains. In this research, Himalayan Gandak River basin is considered as the study area where TLAPS and PLAPS vary significantly due to high altitude of Himalayas. To assess the impact of TLAPS and PLAPS on water balance components, Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated (2000-2007) and validated (2008-2014) on daily time step for three projects i.e., Reference Project (RP), Snowmelt Project (SP) and distributed elevation band snowmelt project (SWAT-ETISM). The analysis discloses that SWAT-ETISM model (which has TLAPS and PLAPS parameters) outperforms the RP and the SP models in predicting streamflow with improved statistical indicators R-2 =0.88, NSE =0.84 and PBIAS = 11.9. Furthermore, it was observed that SWAT-ETISM model comprehensively improved the streamflow statistics by improving the snow water equivalent and water balance components through the consideration of TLAPS and PLAPS values for the region. Hence, the proposed SWAT-ETISM model can be used for estimation of the water budget at the high-altitude and data scarce alpine Himalayan regions and worldwide, where PLAPS and TLAPS are substantial due to altitudinal variation.","[Kumar, Brijesh] Bule Hora Univ, Dept Hydraul & Water Resource Engn, Bule Hora 144, Ethiopia; [Kumar, Brijesh; Roy, Dipankar] Madanapalle Inst Technol & Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Madanapalle 517325, India; [Lakshmi, Venkataraman] Univ Virginia, Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",,"Kumar, B (corresponding author), Bule Hora Univ, Dept Hydraul & Water Resource Engn, Bule Hora 144, Ethiopia.;Kumar, B (corresponding author), Madanapalle Inst Technol & Sci, Dept Civil Engn, Madanapalle 517325, India.",brijeshag1684@gmail.com; dipankar777@gmail.com; vlakshmi@virginia.edu,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2022,19.0,12,,,,,3487,3502,,10.1007/s11629-020-6602-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-020-6602-5,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000898090200010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Out of these three methods, the SMOSVM and VFI are state-of- the-art methods for binary classification problems but have not been applied for landslide prediction, whereas the LR is known as a popular method for landslide susceptibility assessment. In the study, a total of 430 historical landslide polygons and 11 landslide affecting factors such as slope angle, slope aspect, elevation, curvature, lithology, soil, land cover, distance to roads, distance to rivers, distance to lineaments, and rainfall were selected for landslide analysis. For validation and comparison, statistical index-based methods and the receiver operating characteristic curve have been used. Analysis results show that all these models have good performance for landslide spatial prediction but the SMOSVM model has the highest predictive capability, followed by the VFImodel, and the LRmodel, respectively. Thus, SMOSVM is a better model for landslide prediction and can be used for landslide susceptibility mapping of landslide-prone areas.","[Binh Thai Pham] Gujarat Technol Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Nr Visat Three Rd,Visat Gandhinagar Highway, Ahmadabad 382424, Gujarat, India; [Binh Thai Pham] Univ Transport Technol, Dept Geotech Engn, 54 Trieu Khuc, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Dieu Tien Bui] Telemark Univ Coll, Dept Business Adm & Comp Sci, Geog Informat Syst Grp, Hallvard Eikas Plass 1, N-3800 Bo, Telemark, Norway; [Prakash, Indra] Govt Gujarat, BISAG, Dept Sci & Technol, Gandhinagar, India; [Long Hoang Nguyen] Univ Transport Technol, 54 Trieu Khuc, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Dholakia, M.

The current study area is the tourism and hydro energy hub of Pakistan and is affected by environmental hazard. A landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) of the Hindu Kush Himalayan, Swat District, Pakistan, can be created to reduce demographic losses due to landslides. This current study is conducted to apply three bivariate models, including weights of evidence (WOE), frequency ratio (FR), and information value (IV) for an LSM that has not been explored or applied in the current study area. For this purpose, first, an inventory map of 495 landslides was constructed from both ground and satellite data and randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) datasets. Furthermore, 10 conditioning factors (elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, fault, rainfall, land use land cover (LULC), lithology, road, and drainage) used for the mapping of landslides were prepared in ArcGIS 10.8. Finally, LSM is generated based on WOE, FR, and IV models and validated the performance of LSM models using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The findings of success rate curve (SRC) of the WOE, FR, and IV models were 67%, 93%, and 64%, respectively, while the prediction rate curves (PRCs) of the three models were 87%, 95%, and 73%, respectively. The validation results for WOE, FR, and IV justified that the FR model is the most reliable technique of all three of these models to produce the highest accuracy LSM for the present study area. Policymakers can use the findings of current research work to mitigate the loss due to landslide hazard.","[Islam, Fakhrul] Khushal Khan Khattak Univ, Dept Geol, Karak, Pakistan; [Riaz, Salma] Inst Space Technol, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ghaffar, Bushra] Int Islamic Univ Islamabad, Dept Environm Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Tariq, Aqil] Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Starkville, MS 39762 USA; [Tariq, Aqil] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & Re, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Shah, Safeer Ullah] Minist Climate Change, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Nawaz, Muhammad] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Hussain, Mian Luqman] Natl Ctr Excellence Geol, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Ul Amin, Naz] Pakistan Forest Inst, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Li, Qingting] Univ West Scotland, Sch Comp Engn & Phys Sci, Airborne Remote Sensing Ctr, Paisley, Peoples R China; [Lu, Linlin] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shah, Munawar] IST, Dept Space Sci, Space Educ, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Shah, Munawar] IST, Inst Space Technol, GNSS Lab, Natl Ctr GIS & Space Applicat, Islamabad, Pakistan",,"Tariq, A (corresponding author), Mississippi State Univ, Dept Wildlife Fisheries & Aquaculture, Starkville, MS 39762 USA.;Tariq, A (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & Re, Wuhan, Peoples R China.;Lu, LL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",at2139@msstate.edu; aqiltariq@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,19.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 12,2022,10.0,,,,,,,,1027423,10.3389/fenvs.2022.1027423,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1027423,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000876810500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, they remain relatively unstudied because of the inaccessibility of the terrain and the difficulties in field work caused by the thick debris mantles. Observations of debris-covered glaciers are therefore scarce and airborne remote sensing may bridge the gap between scarce field observations and coarse resolution space-borne remote sensing. In this study we deploy an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) before and after the melt and monsoon season (May and October 2013) over the debris-covered tongue of the Lirung Glacier in Nepal. Based on stereo-imaging and the structure for motion algorithm we derive highly detailed ortho-mosaics and digital elevation models (DEMs), which we geometrically correct using differential GPS observations collected in the field. Based on DEM differencing and manual feature tracking we derive the mass loss and the surface velocity of the glacier at a high spatial accuracy. On average, mass loss is limited and the surface velocity is very small. However, the spatial variability of melt rates is very high, and' ice cliffs and supra-glacial ponds show mass losses that can be an order of magnitude higher than the average. We suggest that future research should focus on the interaction between supra-glacial ponds, ice cliffs and englacial hydrology to further understand the dynamics of debris-covered glaciers. Finally, we conclude that UAV deployment has large potential in glaciology and it may revolutionize methods currently applied in studying glacier surface features.

They are bounded to the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain, which has among the highest concentrations of atmospheric ammonia globally. This source of excess nitrogen pushes northwards into the Himalaya, generating concern that Himalayan forests will be impacted. To estimate the extent to which atmospheric nitrogen is impacting Himalayan forests we focussed on lichen epiphytes, which are a well-established bioindicator for atmospheric nitrogen pollution. First, we reviewed published literature describing nitrogen thresholds (critical levels and loads) at which lichen epiphytes are affected, identifying a mean and confidence intervals based on previous research conducted across a diverse set of biogeographic and ecological settings. Second, we used estimates from previously published atmospheric chemistry models (EMEP-WRF and UKCA-CLASSIC) projected to the Himalaya with contrasting spatial resolution and timescales to characterise model variability. Comparing the lichen epiphyte critical levels and loads with the atmospheric chemistry model projections, we created preliminary estimates of the extent to which Himalayan forests are impacted by excess nitrogen; this equated to c. 80-85% and c. 95-98% with respect to ammonia and total nitrogen deposition, respectively.

This study aims to investigate whether the landscape change has any impact on landslide occurrences in the Kalsi-Chakrata road corridor by detailed investigation through correlation of the landslide susceptibility zones and the landscape change, and finally to demarcate the hotspot villages where influence of landscape on landslide occurrence may be more in future. The rational of this work is to delineate the areas with higher landslide susceptibility using the ensemble model of GIS-based multi-criteria decision making through fuzzy landslide numerical risk factor model along the Kalsi-Chakrata road corridor of Uttarakhand where no previous detailed investigation was carried out applying any contemporary statistical techniques. The approach includes the correlation of the landslide conditioning factors in the study area with the changes in land use and land cover (LULC) over the past decade to understand whether frequent landslides have any link with the physical and hydro-meteorological or, infrastructure, and socioeconomic activities. It was performed through LULC change detection and landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and spatial overlay analysis to establish statistical correlation between the said parameters. The LULC change detection was performed using the object-oriented classification of satellite images acquired in 2010 and 2019. The inventory of the past landslides was formed by visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite images supported by an intensive field survey of each landslide area. To assess the landslide susceptibility zones for 2010 and 2019 scenarios, the geo-environmental or conditioning factors such as slope, rainfall, lithology, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), proximity to road and land use and land cover (LULC) were considered, and the fuzzy LNRF technique was applied. The results indicated that the LULC in the study area was primarily transformed from forest cover and sparse vegetation to open areas and arable land, which is increased by 6.7% in a decade. The increase in built-up areas and agricultural land by 2.3% indicates increasing human interference that is continuously transforming the natural landscape. The landslide susceptibility map of 2019 shows that about 25% of the total area falls under high and very high susceptibility classes. The result shows that 80% of the high landslide susceptible class is contained by LULC classes of open areas, scrubland, and sparse vegetation, which point out the profound impact of landscape change that aggravate landslide occurrence in that area. The result acclaims that specific LULC classes, such as open areas, barren-rocky lands, are more prone to landslides in this Lesser Himalayan road corridor, and the LULC-LSM correlation can be instrumental for landslide probability assessment concerning the changing landscape. The fuzzy LNRF model applied has 89.6% prediction accuracy at 95% confidence level which is highly satisfactory. The present study of the connection of LULC change with the landslide probability and identification of the most fragile landscape at the village level has been instrumental in delineation of landslide susceptible areas, and such studies may help the decision-makers adopt appropriate mitigation measures in those villages where the landscape changes have mainly resulted in increased landslide occurrences and formulate strategic plans to promote ecologically sustainable development of the mountainous communities in India's Lesser Himalayas.","[Sur, Ujjwal; Singh, Prafull] Amity Univ, Amity Inst Geoinformat & Remote Sensing, Sect 125, Noida, UP, India; [Singh, Prafull] Cent Univ South Bihar, Dept Geol, Gaya 824236, India; [Rai, Praveen Kumar] Language Univ UP State Govt Univ, Dept Geog KMC, Lucknow, UP, India; [Thakur, Jay Krishna] UIZ, Umwelt & Informat Stechnol, Berlin, Germany",,"Singh, P (corresponding author), Amity Univ, Amity Inst Geoinformat & Remote Sensing, Sect 125, Noida, UP, India.;Singh, P (corresponding author), Cent Univ South Bihar, Dept Geol, Gaya 824236, India.",pks.jiwaji@gmail.com,,,,,,,,15.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,23.0,9,,,,,13526,13554,,10.1007/s10668-021-01226-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01226-1,,FEB 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000616466700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding the influence of climate change on the different sub-sectors and functions of a market system is crucial to increasing the systems' climate resilience and to ensuring the long-term viability of the sectors. Our research applies a new approach to climate change analysis to better understand the influence of climate change on each step of an agricultural market systemon its core (processing units, storage facilities and sales) and support functions (sapling supply, research, insurance and agricultural policy). We use spatial climate analyses to investigate current and projected changes in climate for different regions in Nepal. We then analyse the risks and vulnerabilities of the sub-sectors banana, charcoal, coffee, macadamia, orange, vegetables and walnut. Our results show that temperatures and precipitation levels will change differently depending on the climatic regions, and that climate change elicits different responses from the market functions both between and within each of the different sub-sectors.

Further investigation on meteorological data indicated that increases of temperature and total radiation were the primary causes of accelerated glacial melting. Reduced wind speed and slight decreases in precipitation triggered by weakening of the South Asian summer monsoon due to warming, may also have contributed to glacial shrinkage. The rate of glacial retreat in the studied region is lower than that in the southern Himalayan region, but larger than that in the Karakoram, primarily because Ayilariju glaciers were located on the margin of the Indian monsoon dominated region.","[Li, Zhiguo; Zhang, Jingjing; Li, Xuexin] Shangqiu Normal Univ, Environm & Planning Coll, Shangqiu 476000, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhiguo; Tian, Lide] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Fang, Haiyan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuhong] Shangqiu Normal Univ, Life Sci Coll, Shangqiu 476000, Peoples R China",,"Li, ZG (corresponding author), Shangqiu Normal Univ, Environm & Planning Coll, Shangqiu 476000, Peoples R China.;Li, ZG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",lizhiguo999999@163.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2016,75.0,6,,,,,,,460,10.1007/s12665-016-5341-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5341-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000372251000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

A good agreement was found between the observed and predicted runoff (correlation R-2 > 0.8). The hydrological model was then used to simulate the runoff of Chandra River for a period of 2000 to 2015. Almost 68% of the predicted runoff occurred during the ablation period (May to September). A sensitivity study of the Chandra basin hydrology to a predicted warming climate of 1 to 4 K, toward the end of the century suggests that increased production of glacial melt water would have more impact on runoff than potential increase in precipitation.

These changes in the landscape were analysed using satellite data from 1990, 2001 and 2006. The vegetation type maps of Dehradun forest division were prepared by supervised classification technique in order to study the landscape dynamics. Patch density, edge density, shape index, cohesion index, interspersion and juxtaposition index, normalised entropy, and relative richness are some important landscape metrics used in the study for quantifying the characteristics of landscape. The landscape metrics analysis and transformation analysis show that the forested areas are getting degraded and physical connectedness between the patches have also decreased making them isolated.

Contour maps for the mean annual flow and actual evapotranspiration as a function of the downscaled projected mean annual precipitation and temperatures are produced and can serve as a hands-on forecast tool of future hydrology. The overall results of these future SWAT hydrological projections indicate similar trends of changes in magnitudes, seasonal patterns and extremes of the UIB-stream flows for almost all climate scenarios/models/periods-combinations analyzed. In particular, all but one GCM_RCM model-the one predicting a very high future temperature rise-indicated mean annual flow increases throughout the 21st century, wherefore, interestingly, these are stronger for the middle years (2041-2070) than at its end (2071-2100). The seasonal shifts as well as the extremes follow also similar trends for all climate scenario/model/period combinations, e.g., an earlier future arrival (in May-June instead of July-August) of high flows and increased spring and winter flows, with upper flow extremes (peaks) projected to drastically increase by 50 to >100%, and with significantly decreased annual recurrence intervals, i.e., a tremendously increased future flood hazard for the UIB.

To analyze the long term contribution of snowmelt and glacier/icemelt to river hydrology we apply a water budget model to simulate hydrology of the Liddar watershed in the western Himalaya, India for the 20th century (1901-2010) and future IPCC A1B climate change scenario. Long term (1901-2010) temperature and precipitation data in this region show a warming trend (0.08 degrees C yr(-1)) and an increase in precipitation (0.28 mm yr(-1)), with a significant variability in seasonal trends. In particular, winter months have undergone the most warming, along with a decrease in precipitation rates; precipitation has increased throughout the spring. These trends have accelerated the melting and rapid disappearance of snow, causing a seasonal redistribution in the availability of water. Our model results show that about 60% of the annual runoff of the Liddar watershed is contributed from the snowmelt, while only 2% is contributed from glacier ice. The climate trend observed from the 1901 to 2010 time period and its impact on the availability of water will become significantly worse under the IPCC climate change scenarios. Our results suggest that there is a significant shift in the timing and quantity of water runoff in this region of the Himalayas due to snow distribution and melt.

The epicenter was located in the Namche Barwa region of the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Here, we have derived coseismic deformation from Global Positioning System (GPS) data and ascending Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Based on a joint inversion of the two datasets, we obtained the coseismic slip distribution along a curved, northeast trending, and high-angle (dip angle of 75 degrees) thrust fault. Our results show that the seismic moment release was 7.49 x 10(18) N.m, corresponding to a moment magnitude of Mw 6.55. The maximum slip was 1.03 m and the main rupture zone extended to a 12 km depth. The earthquake may have been related to the release of strain accumulated during the subduction of the Indian plate beneath the Eurasian continent. We identified a high strain rate and low b-values around the epicentral area before the earthquake, indicating that the earthquake was nucleated under a high strain/stress state. The data indicate two regions, southwest and southeast to the epicenter (the eastern Main Himalaya Thrust and northern end of the Sagaing fault), which remain under high stress/strain conditions and pose a significant seismic hazard.","[Jian, Huizi; Wang, Lifeng; Gan, Weijun; Zhang, Keliang; Li, Yanchuan; Liang, Shiming; Liu, Yunhua; Gong, Wenyu; Yin, Xinzhong] China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geol, State Key Lab Earthquake Dynam, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",,"Jian, HZ (corresponding author), China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geol, State Key Lab Earthquake Dynam, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",jianhuizi@ies.ac.cn; wanglf@ies.ac.cn; wjgan@ies.ac.cn; klzhang@ies.ac.cn; yanchuan.li@geoazur.unice.fr; liangshiming@ies.ac.cn; liuyunhua@ies.ac.cn; gwenyu@ies.ac.cn; yinxinzhong@ies.ac.cn,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2,2019,11.0,24,,,,,,,2940,10.3390/rs11242940,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11242940,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000507333400056,View Full Record in Web of Science

The assessment of water quality is critical for the comparison of natural and anthropogenic sources in the downstream areas due to the dependence of the population on the glacial meltwater for freshwater supply. In the present study, we investigate the physical and ionic characteristics of glacial meltwater from Naradu Glacier catchment concerning the dominant weathering process. The freshwater samples were collected during the ablation period of 2016 and 2017 from specified locations. The physical parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, and temperature) were measured in the field while the analyses for concentrations of major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+) and major anions (Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, NO3-) were done in the laboratory. The anions (HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3-) and cations (Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+) concentrations were observed to have similar trends for both of the ablation period. The statistical analysis shows the predominance of geological weathering processes in the catchment as the controlling factor for the variation in concentration of different ionic species. The catchment was found to be rich in rocks with carbonate mineral making the Ca2+ and HCO3- the most dominant ions in the glacial meltwater.","[Kumar, Rajesh; Kumar, Ramesh; Singh, Shaktiman; Singh, Atar; Chaudhary, Himanshu] Sharda Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Greater Noida, India; [Kumar, Rajesh] Cent Univ Rajsthan, Sch Earth Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Ajmer, India; [Singh, Shaktiman; Bhardwaj, Anshuman] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci Elect & Space Engn, Div Space Technol, Lulea, Sweden",,"Kumar, R (corresponding author), Sharda Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Greater Noida, India.;Kumar, R (corresponding author), Cent Univ Rajsthan, Sch Earth Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Ajmer, India.",rameshkumar9234@gmail.com; rajesh.kumar@sharda.ac.in,,,,,,,,10.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2019,78.0,24,,,,,,,683,10.1007/s12665-019-8687-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8687-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000511854300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite the need of high attention towards conserving and managing wetland resources, mapping them is a least practiced activity. This study shows the temporal change in land use and land cover pattern of Tso Moriri Lake, the highest altitude lake in India and designated as Ramsar site in year 2002, using multi-sensor and multi-date imagery. Due to change in hydro-meteorological conditions of the region, this lake area has been reduced. Since the lake recharge is dependent on snowmelt, hence change in climatic conditions (less snowfall in winters), to a certain extent, is also responsible for the decrease in water level and water spread of the lake. The result shows that the lake area has reduced approximately 2 km(2) in the last 15 years, and also, agriculture, grasslands, and vegetation cover have increased to a significant extent. Agricultural land and grasslands have doubled while the vegetation cover has increased more than six times, showing the coupled effect of climate change and anthropogenic activities.

The current communication attempts to provide a detailed account on the current state of knowledge and research gaps in floristic studies of Himachal Pradesh, Western Himalaya. Based on an extensive review of more than 140 studies in the form of scientific peer reviewed literature on floristics, medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs), rare, endangered, threatened and endemic species and ethno-botany, it is revealed that the number of floristic studies in Himachal Pradesh have surged in the past years but studies pertaining to the lower plants remain meagre. Unfortunately, the remote valleys including micro-watersheds lying in the cold-arid regions are relatively less studied in terms of available growing stock and population status of MAPs. Depleting traditional ethno-botanical knowledge has been the major concern and, many threatened MAPs need to be accessed globally following IUCN standards.

Through this study, we try to answer how species differing in phenological cycles, specifically Cassia tom and Lantana camara, differ in the manner in which they invade new regions in India in the future climate. Since both species occupy identical niches, exploring their invasive potential in different climate change scenarios will offer critical insights into invasion and inform ecosystem management. We use three modelling protocols (i.e., maximum entropy, generalised linear model and generalised additive model) to predict the current distribution. Projections are made for both moderate (A1B) and extreme (A2) IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) scenarios for the year 2050 and 2100. The study reveals that the distributions of C. tora (annual) and L. camara (perennial) would depend on the precipitation of the warmest quarter and moisture availability. C. tora may demonstrate physiological tolerance to the mean diurnal temperature range and L. camara to the solar radiation. C. tora may invade central India, while L. camara may invade the Western Himalaya, parts of the Eastern Himalaya and the Western Ghats. The distribution ranges of both species could shift in the northern and north-eastern directions in India, owing to changes in moisture availability. The possible alterations in precipitation regimes could lead to water stress, which might have cascading effects on species invasion. L. camara might adapt to climate change better compared with C. tora. This comparative analysis of the future distributions of two invasive plants with contrasting habits demonstrates that temporal complementarity would prevail over the competition.

The performance of the SRM model during calibration and validation was assessed using volume difference (Dv) and coefficient of determination (R-2). The D-v was found to be 11.7, -10.1, -11.8, 1.96, and 8.6 in 2009-2014, respectively, while the respective R-2 was 0.96, 0.92, 0.95, 0.90, and 0.94. The D-v and R-2 values indicate that the simulated snowmelt runoff closely agrees with the observed values. The simulated findings were assessed under three different climate change scenarios: (a) an increase in precipitation by +20%, (b) a temperature rise of +2 degrees C, and (c) a temperature rise of +2 degrees C with a 20% increase in snow cover. In scenario (b), the simulated results showed that runoff increased by 53% in summer (April-September). In contrast, the projected increased discharge for scenarios (a) and (c) was 37% and 67%, respectively.

Forest type density mapping was done through on-screen visual interpretation of satellite data. After conducting preliminary survey in 2009, 45 quadrats (0.1 ha) were laid in six forest types for collecting field inventory data viz., diameter at breast height, tree height, slope and aspect.

A decreasing trend of carbon (145.13-134.87 mt) was observed over the period of time. Temporal biomass carbon dynamics was analyzed for REDD+ opportunities. The temporal variation of carbon observed was found to be more useful for claiming benefits under negative options (deforestation and forest degradation) of REDD+.

The increase in atmospheric CO2 due to climate change may have a significant impact on both soil organic carbon storage and management practices to sequester organic carbon in agricultural areas. The aim of the study was to simulate climate change impact on soil carbon sequestration using CENTURY model. The statistical downscaling model (SDSM) was used to downscale the climate variables (temperature and rainfall) under two scenarios A2 and B2 for three periods: 2020 (2011-2040), 2050 (2041-2070) and 2080 (2071-2099). Downscaling was better in case of temperature than precipitation, which was evident from coefficient of correlation for temperature (r(2) = 0.91-0.99) and precipitation (r(2) = 0.71-0.80). Downscaling of climate data revealed that the temperature may increase for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080 periods, whereas precipitation may increase till 2020 and then it may reduce in 2050 and 2080 as compared to 2020 in the study area. For CENTURY model, the input parameters were obtained through soil sampling and interviewing the farmers as well, whereas the climatic variables (maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation) were taken from the SDSM output. The historical data of soils were collected from the literature, and six agricultural sites were selected for estimating soil carbon sequestration. After soil sampling of the same sites, it was found that the organic carbon had increased two times than historical data might be due to the addition of high organic matter in the form of farm yard manure. Therefore, the model was calibrated, considering more organic carbon in the area, and was validated using random points in the study area. Determination coefficient (r(2) = 0.95) and RMSE (538 g c/m(2)) were computed to assess the accuracy of the model. The organic carbon was predicted from 2011 to 2099 and was compared with the 2011 predicted data. The study revealed that the amount of soil organic carbon in Bhaitan, Kanatal, Kotdwar, Malas, Pata and Thangdhar sites may reduce by 11.6, 15.8, 17.19, 13.54, 19.2 and 12.7%, respectively, for A2 scenario and by 9.62, 15.6, 15.72, 11.45, 16.96 and 13.36% for B2 scenario up to 2099.

However, limited literature is available on the spatial distribution and trends of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the sub-basins of UIB. This study covers the comparative assessment of flows and SSC trends measured at 13 stations in the UIB along with the variability of precipitation and temperatures possibly due to climate change for the past three decades. In the course of this period, the country's largest reservoir, Tarbela, on the Indus River was depleted rapidly due to heavy sediment influx from the UIB. Sediment management of existing storage and future planned hydraulic structures (to tap 30,000 MW in the region) depends on the correct assessment of SSC, their variation patterns, and trends. In this study, the SSC trends are determined along with trends of discharges, precipitation, and temperatures using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. The results reveal that the annual flows and SSC are in a balanced state for the Indus River at Besham Qila, whereas the SSC are significantly reduced ranging from 18.56%-28.20% per decade in the rivers of Gilgit at Alam Bridge, Indus at Kachura, and Brandu at Daggar. The SSC significantly increase ranging from 20.08%-40.72% per decade in the winter together with a significant increase of average air temperature. During summers, the SSC are decreased significantly ranging from 18.63%-27.79% per decade along with flows in the Hindukush and Western-Karakorum regions, which is partly due to the Karakorum climate anomaly, and in rainfall-dominated basins due to rainfall reduction. In Himalayan regions, the SSC are generally increased slightly during summers. These findings will be helpful for understanding the sediment trends associated with flow, precipitation, and temperature variations, and may be used for the operational management of current reservoirs and the design of several hydroelectric power plants that are planned for construction in the UIB.","[Ul Hussan, Waqas; Seidel, Frank; Nestmann, Franz] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Water & River Basin Management, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Shahzad, Muhammad Khurram] Inst Southern Punjab, Dept Civil Engn, Multan 60000, Pakistan; [Costa, Anna] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland",,"Ul Hussan, W (corresponding author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Water & River Basin Management, Kaiserstr 12, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany.;Shahzad, MK (corresponding author), Inst Southern Punjab, Dept Civil Engn, Multan 60000, Pakistan.",waqas.hussan@kit.edu; shahzadmuhammadkhurram@gmail.com; Frank.Seidel@kit.edu; anna.costa.pekar@gmail.com; franz.nestmann@kit.edu,,,,,,,,12.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2020,12.0,3,,,,,,,730,10.3390/w12030730,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12030730,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000529249500115,View Full Record in Web of Science

Changing climatic conditions seriously put an impact on these available ice and snow masses. These glaciers may affect downstream population by glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and surge events due to climatic variation. So, monitoring of these glaciers and available ice masses is important. This research delivers an approach for dynamics of major glaciers of the Hunza River Basin. We delineated 27 major glaciers of HRB and examined their status by using Landsat (OLI, ETM+, ETM, TM), digital elevation model (DEM) over the period of 1990-2018. In 1990, the total area covered by these glaciers is about 2589.75 +/- 86 km(2) and about 2565.12 +/- 68km(2) in 2018. Our results revealed that from 2009 to 2015, glacier coverage of HRB advanced with a mean annual advance rate of 2.22 +/- 0.1 km(2) a(-1). Conversely, from 1994 to 1999, the strongest reduction in glacier area with a mean rate of - 3.126 +/- 0.3 km(2) a(-1) is recorded. The glaciers of HRB are relatively stable compared to Hindukush, Himalayan, and Tibetan Plateau region of the world. The steep slope glacier's retreat rate is more than that of gentle slope glaciers, and the glaciers below an elevation of 5000 m above sea level change significantly. Based on climate data from 1995 to 2018, HRB shows a decreasing trend in temperature and increasing precipitation. The glacier area's overall retreat is due to an increase in summer temperature while the glacier advancement is induced possibly by winter and autumn precipitation.","[Ali, Sajid; Khan, Garee; Hassan, Wajid; Qureshi, Javed Akhter; Bano, Iram] Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan; [Ali, Sajid] Chinese Acad Sci, Environm Change & Multisphere Interact ECMI Team, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Pro, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ali, Sajid; Hassan, Wajid] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hassan, Wajid] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Earth Surface Proc, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu, Peoples R China",,"Khan, G (corresponding author), Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan.",sajid.ah@itpcas.ac.cn; garee.khan@kiu.edu.pk; wajidhassan@imde.ac.cn; javed.akhter@kiu.edu.pk; iram.bano@kiu.edu.pk,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,28.0,44,,,,,63178,63190,,10.1007/s11356-021-15154-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15154-0,,JUL 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000669773100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Shrinking distribution of the three large carnivores in the Greater Himalaya,CLIMATIC CHANGE,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Mammalian carnivores are key to our understanding of ecosystem dynamics, but most of them are threatened with extinction all over the world. Conservating large carnivores is often an arduous task considering the complex relationship between humans and carnivores, and the diverse range and reasons of threats they face. Climate change is exacerbating the situation further by interacting with most existing threats and amplifying their impacts. The Mountains of Central and South Asia are warming twice as rapidly as the rest of the northern hemisphere. There has been limited research on the effect of climate change and other variables on large carnivores. We studied the patterns in spatio-temporal distribution of three sympatric carnivores, common leopard, snow leopard, and Asiatic black bear in Kishtwar high altitude National Park, a protected area in the Great Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir. We investigated the effects of key habitat characteristics as well as human disturbance and climatic factors to understand the spatio-temporal change in their distributions between the early 1990s and around the year 2016-2017. We found a marked contraction in the distribution of the three carnivores between the two time periods. While snow leopard shifted upwards and further away from human settlements, common leopard and Asiatic black bear suffered higher rates of local extinctions at higher altitudes and shifted to lower areas with more vegetation, even if that brought them closer to settlements. We also found some evidence that snow leopards were less likely to have faced range contraction in areas with permanent glaciers. Our study underscores the importance of climate adaptive conservation practices for long-term management in the Greater Himalaya, including the monitoring of changes in habitat, and space-use patterns by human communities and wildlife.","[Kichloo, Muzaffar A.] Govt Degree Coll Banihal, Dept Environm Sci, Banihal, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Sharma, Koustubh] Snow Leopard Trust, Global Snow Leopard & Ecosyst Protect Program, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; [Sharma, Neeraj] Univ Jammu, Inst Mt Environm, Jammu, India",,"Sharma, K (corresponding author), Snow Leopard Trust, Global Snow Leopard & Ecosyst Protect Program, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.",omar.mzfr@gmail.com; koustubhsharma@gmail.com; nirazsharma@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2023,176.0,9,,,,,,,118,10.1007/s10584-023-03582-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-023-03582-5,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001048625200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This article provides a comprehensive information about the plankton (phytoplankton and periphyton) assemblages, water quality (WQ), bathymetry, morphometry, and land use land cover (LULC) of some select high altitude mountain lakes of Kashmir Himalaya. LULC analysis revealed that the catchment of the lakes spread over an area of about 16179 ha, is covered by different land cover types dominated by pastures (50.8%), followed by barren rocky (32.6%), snow and glaciers (11.9%), lakes (2.5%), forest (2%), and streams (0.2%). Bathymetric and morphometric analysis revealed that the Gangbal Lake is the deepest (84 m) and largest (162.4 ha) among the investigated lakes. The water quality index revealed that all the HALs have the excellent water quality category. Statistical analysis (Wilk's lambda) depicted that nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N), nitrite nitrogen (NO2 (-)-N), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP), and magnesium hardness (Mg-H) are responsible for major variability between all HALs sites. The cations followed the order of Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ while as anions followed the order as HCO3- > Cl- > SO4(2-). Algal composition (phytoplankton and periphyton) assessment revealed the presence of 61 taxa belonging to Bacillariophyceae (45), Chlorophyceae (14), Cyanophyceae (1), and Xanthophyceae (1). The higher dominance of Bacillariophyceae indicates oligotrophic nature of the lakes. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) highlighted the role of various water quality parameters like pH, EC, and TDS on the composition of phytoplankton and periphyton species among the lakes. The present study therefore generated a baseline database for some of the HALs of Kashmir Himalaya that can act as a precursor for more research on future changes in the lake ecosystems of the region.","[Islam, Sheikh Tajamul; Dar, Shahid Ahmad; Sofi, Mohd Sharjeel; Bhat, Sami Ullah; Sabha, Inam; Hamid, Aadil; Jehangir, Arshid] Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Srinagar, India; [Bhat, Aftab Ahmad] Govt Degree Coll Beerwah, Dept Environm Sci, Budgam, India",,"Bhat, SU (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Srinagar, India.",samiullahbhat11@gmail.com,,,,,,,,17.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 4,2021,9.0,,,,,,,,681965,10.3389/fenvs.2021.681965,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.681965,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000717110500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we employed dendrochronological methods on climate-sensitive tree rings from Abies pindrow to reconstruct the SSM in the Western Himalayan mountain region of Pakistan from 1855 to 2020. December (r = 0.41), May (r = 0.40), and June (r = 0.65) SSMs were found to be the limiting factors for A. pindrow growth. However, only the June SSM showed reconstruction possibility (coefficient of efficiency = 0.201 and reduction of error = 0.325). Over the studied period, we found 6 years (wet year) when June SSM was above the threshold of 32.04 (mean + 2 & delta;) and 1 year (dry year) when June SSM was below the threshold of 21.28 (mean - 2 & delta;). It was revealed that 1921 and 1917 were the driest and wettest SSM of all time, with means of 19.34 and 36.49, respectively.

Don in India,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"It is vital to understand the distribution area of a threatened plant species for its better conservation and management planning. Satyrium nepalense (family: Orchidaceae) is a threatened terrestrial orchid species with valuable medicinal and nutritional properties. The survival of S. nepalense in wild conditions has been challenged by increasing global surface temperature. Hence, understanding the impact of climate change on its potential distribution is crucial to conserve and restore this species. In present study, Maxent species distribution modeling algorithm was used to simulate the current distribution of S. nepalense in India and predict the possible range shift in projected future climate scenarios. A set of 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim database were used to predict the potential suitable habitats in current climatic condition and four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) scenarios by integrating five General Circulation Models (GCMs) for future distribution modeling of species for the years 2050 and 2070. Furthermore, change analysis was performed to identify the suitable habitat in current and future climate for delineating range expansion (gain), contraction (loss), and stable (no change) habitats of species. The Maxent model predicted that similar to 2.38% of the geographical area in India is presently climatically suitable for S. nepalense. The key bioclimatic variables affecting the distribution of studied species were the mean temperature of warmest quarter, mean temperature of wettest quarter, precipitation of warmest quarter, and temperature seasonality. Under future climate change scenarios, the total suitable habitat of S. nepalense will increase slightly in the Himalayan region and likely to migrate towards northward, but in the Western Ghats region, the suitable areas will be lost severely. The net habitat loss under four RCP scenarios was estimated from 26 to 39% for the year 2050, which could further increase from 47 to 60% by the year 2070. The finding of the predictive Maxent modeling approach indicates that warming climates could significantly affect the potential habitats of S. nepalense and hence suitable conservation measures need to be taken to protect this threatened orchid species in wild conditions.","[Kumar, Devendra; Rawat, Sandeep] Sikkim Reg Ctr, GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm NIHE, Gangtok, Sikkim, India",,"Kumar, D (corresponding author), Sikkim Reg Ctr, GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm NIHE, Gangtok, Sikkim, India.",devendrawii@gmail.com; sandeep_rawat15@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,29.0,48,,,SI,,72431,72444,,10.1007/s11356-022-20412-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20412-w,,MAY 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000791884600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is found that about 78% of the slopes is having an angle more than 45 degrees after cutting. The present study suggests that a FoS greater than 1.25 can be achieved by installing a 5.5 m anchor at 18 degrees with the horizontal at a spacing of 1 m. Confirmatory field tests on the anchor are also conducted to ensure the accuracy of the adopted design parameters.

The current study intends to analyse and compare the predictive performance of two entirely different AI techniques, fuzzy expert system (FES), a bivariate statistical technique, and extreme learning machine (ELM), a multivariate statistical technique for GIS based LSZ. The Mussoorie Township, a famous tourist destination in the Indian State of Uttarakhand was taken as the study area. Thematic layers of relevant causative factors and landslide inventory were prepared for the study area through field survey, remote sensing, and GIS. The resultant landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) of the study area, LSM-I of FES and LSM-II of ELM were critically evaluated and compared with the aid of landslide inventory of the study area.","[Peethambaran, Bipin; Anbalagan, R.; Goswami, Ajanta] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shihabudheen, K.

R.",,,An integrated water resource management tool for the Himalayan region,ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"The Himalayan region of Nepal and northern India experiences hydrological extremes from monsoonal floods during July-September to periods of very low flows during the dry season (December-February). While flooding causes significant damage to local populations and infrastructure, the lack of water during the dry season impacts people's agriculturally based livelihoods. Furthermore, competition for water for irrigation, domestic supply, industrial uses and hydropower is at a maximum during the dry season. Successful management of water resources is dependant on an ability to balance the natural availability of water with the pressures exerted by water-users. A software system has been developed to assist water resource practitioners in the region to meet these goals. The software incorporates regression-based hydrological models that enable long-term average monthly recession flows to be estimated in ungauged catchments. Recessions are the periods of successively decreasing flows that occur during the dry season. Users are able to compare predicted flows with observed flows recorded at gauging stations. The impact of existing and future water use scenarios on dry season flows can be simulated by characterisation of seasonal water use at points within the catchment. The user-friendly interface is Geographical Information System based, providing the ability to add contextual spatial data to enhance the application of the conceptual model. Standard display and output formats provide a consistent set of reporting tools. This paper describes the components of the system and presents a case study implementation in the West Rapti catchment (Nepal). (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the present study integrated geographic information system (GIS) and three comprehensive and systematic multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques such as Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Vise Kriterijumska Optimi-zacijaik Ompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), and Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) in Koch Bihar district for comparative assessment of the flood-susceptible zones. The multi-dimensional 21 indicators were considered, and multicollinearity statistics were employed to erase the issues regarding highly correlated parameters (i.e., MFI and long-term annual rainfall). Results of MCDM models depicted that the riparian areas and riverine chars (islands) are the most susceptible sectors, accounting for around 40% of the total area. The microlevel assessment revealed that flooding was most susceptible in the Tufanganj-I, Tufanganj-II, and Mathabhanga-I blocks, while Haldibari, Sitalkuchi, and Sitai blocks were less susceptible. Spearman's rank (r(s)) tests among the three MCDM models revealed that TOPSIS-EDAS persisted in a high correlation (r(s) = 0.714) in contrast to the relationships between VIKOR-EDAS (r(s) = 0.651) and TOPSIS-VIKOR (r(s) = 0.639). The model's efficiency was statistically judged by applying the receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC), mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) techniques to recognize the better-suited models for mapping the flood susceptibility. The performance of all techniques is found good enough (ROC-AUC = >0.700 and MAE, MSE and RMSE = <0.300). However, TOPSIS and VIKOR have manifested an excellent outcome and are highly recommended for identifying flood susceptibility in such active flood-prone areas. Thus, this kind of study addresses the role of GIS in the construction of the flood susceptibility of the region and the performance of the respective models in a very lucid manner.","[Mitra, Rajib] Univ North Bengal, Dept Geog & Appl Geog, PO North Bengal Univ, Raja Rammohunpur 734013, India; [Das, Jayanta] Rampurhat Coll, Dept Geog, PO Rampurhat, Rampurhat 731224, India",,"Das, J (corresponding author), Rampurhat Coll, Dept Geog, PO Rampurhat, Rampurhat 731224, India.",rajibmitrageo@gmail.com; jayanta.daas@gmail.com,,,,,,,,24.0,24.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2023,30.0,6,,,,,16036,16067,,10.1007/s11356-022-23168-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-23168-5,,SEP 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000862233200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among the identified gaps in knowledge, lack of objective assessment of threats was considered a major impediment in setting conservation priorities. The paper addresses this issue keeping in view the needs of users (industry) and conservation concerns of academics (biologists). An approach for prioritisation of MPs for conservation was thus developed. Prioritisation based on three indices: (i) use value index (UVI) indicate threats imposed by users, (ii) sensitivity index (SI) reflect conservation concerns of biologists, and (iii) importance value index (IVI) is the cumulative value of (i) and (ii) to prevent biased approach. Dependence of pharmaceutical industry on only 10% of the available stock and that too on non-native elements suggest that the potential of true Himalayan MPs has not been harnessed as yet. However, increased dependence on exclusive wild forms (64.6%), dominance of destructive harvest trend (69%) and restricted distribution range of most MPs used by the industry is a pointer to the intensity of threat. The paper identifies 20 top ranking MPs for conservation in each life form. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study presents a coupled modeling framework to analyze the unsteady flows in the downstream of the Teesta and Lachung Rivers using hydrodynamic and hydrological models. The present approach leads to unsteady flow simulations along stream channel reach. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is used for the projection of streamflow, water depth, and precipitation at various gauged and ungauged locations over the selected catchment using Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 5 (CMIP5) CM3 model data sets with their representative concentration pathway (RCP) experiments and observed hydrometeorological data. SWAT-based projected scenarios are incorporated in the hydrodynamic model for the projection of water level, flood discharge, and flooded area at different sections in the downstream of the Teesta and Lachung Rivers. Using projected flood flows and water-level data, the rating curve equations have been developed at the outlets such as Chungthang and Lachung. The study outcomes resulting from both models show a very good agreement between the simulated streamflow and observed streamflow at the outlet locations. The uncertainties can also be associated in the modeling outcomes. Thus, a statistical-cum-stochastic downscaling method has been applied to downscale the CMIP5 CM3 model-based meteorological variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation). The modeling errors prior to project streamflow have been adjusted using a sequential parameter fitting approach (SUFI2). The hydrodynamic model-based projected unsteady flood flows are found highly uncertain in the downstream portion of both rivers, and thus several extreme flood peaks have been observed in the final outcomes. The observations show that the water velocities have increased in the projected scenarios (recorded as 8.5 m/s), as compared to historical scenarios (6.5 m/s). Using projected time series discharge and water level (stage), the rating curve equations, which have been developed as per the low to extreme emission scenarios, can be used in the future planning and management of the water resources systems.

The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) derived by the cryospheric data from the MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) was employed to predict the daily discharges of the Gilgit. The SRM was successfully calibrated, and the simulation was undertaken from 2005 to 2010, with a coefficient of model efficiency ranging from 0.84-0.94. The average contributions of (snow+glacier) and rainfall to the stream flows of the Gilgit from 2001-10 were 78.35% and 21.65%, respectively, derived from the SRM. The representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 were used to investigate the effects of the changes in temperature on climate of the Gilgit catchment. Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the air temperature of Gilgit will increase by 3(omicron)C, whereas the increase in precipitation will be minor. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario (overshooting scenario), air temperature will increase by 10.7(omicron)C, whereas precipitation will decrease between 2010 and the end of the 21(st) century in the Gilgit catchment. The application of the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 mean temperature scenarios in the SRM suggested that with increases in mean temperature of 3.02(omicron)C and 10.7(omicron)C, respectively, the average annual runoff in the Gilgit will increase by 67.03 and 177.5%, respectively, compared with the observed runoff by the end of the 21(st) century.

Recent advances in Earth observation and seismic monitoring system can offer clues to the location and timing of impending catastrophic failures in high mountain regions.","[Fan, Xuanmei; Yang, Ying-Hui; Zou, Chengbin; Dai, Lanxin; Dou, Xiangyang; Xu, Qiang; Huang, Runqui] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Yunus, Ali P.] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Mohali, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Mohali 140306, Punjab, India; [Subramanian, Srikrishnan Siva] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Ctr Excellence Disaster Mitigat & Management, Roorkee 247667, Uttarakhand, India; [Narayana, Allu Chinna] Univ Hyderabad, Ctr Earth & Space Sci, Hyderabad 500046, India; [Avtar, Ram] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Environm Earth Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan",,"Fan, XM (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Geohazard Prevent & Geoenvironm Pro, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.;Yunus, AP (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Mohali, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Mohali 140306, Punjab, India.",fxm_cdut@qq.com; yunusp@iisermohali.ac.in,,,,,,,,14.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 25,2022,836.0,,,,,,,,155380,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155380,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155380,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000832998500002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Traditional knowledge can help to provide efficient, appropriate and time-tested ways of responding to climate change especially in far-flung communities. However, little is known about how traditional coping strategies translate into adaptation to long-term changes, and to what degree they prevent pro-active, transformational responses to climate change. This paper assesses the use of climate related information for communities in the Himalayan foothills of rural India, and reports on the barriers to adaptation planning and actions. Surveys have been carried out to analyze the current practices and the role of information in planning for climate change adaptation in the rural areas of the Nainital region of India located in Western Himalaya. Respondents perceive the local climate change, the intensity of change, and the negative impacts on the community and landscape. Decreases in water quantity and changes in precipitation patterns are among the major concerns for respondents, however, communities have begun to use traditional knowledge and historical climate information for developing strategies suitable to cope with impacts of climate change. Going forward, additional information is needed to match the high priority community needs with viable adaptation strategies. Lack of money, lack of access to information, and lack of awareness or understanding are considered the three largest hurdles besides low priority for adaptation, recognized by community members as barriers to adaptation planning and actions. Adaptation plans must be integrated into both top-down and bottom-up approaches to plan for enabling sustainable development and the efficient use of information for adaptation. Finally, tradititilkal knowledge seems to be useful not only in contrasting climate change impacts, but also in recovering several ecosystem services that work all together for enanching the quality of life of villagers at local scale.","[Pandey, Rajiv; Gupt, Ajay K.] ICFRE, Dehra Dun, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kumar, Praveen; Joshi, P.

Three representative concentration pathway (RCP) emission scenarios, namely, RCP2.6, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5, of three general circulation models (GCM) archived by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), were utilized for the projection of climatic variables (such as precipitation and temperature). Long-term (2011-2100) projections of precipitation and temperature for different emission scenarios were made using the statistical downscaling technique. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) hydrological model was used for hydrological modeling of the river basin. The observed streamflow series for the period of 2002-2013 has been utilized for calibration and validation of the hydrological model. Parameterization, uncertainty analysis, and parameter sensitivity analysis of the model were performed using a sequential uncertainty fitting (SUFI2) program. The coefficient of determination (R-2) for the calibration and validation of the hydrological model on the monthly streamflow time series was found to be 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. Future projections of the precipitation and temperature suggest an increase in the annual average maximum temperature (Tmax), annual average minimum temperature (Tmin), and annual precipitation of the river basin. These projected climatic variables were used as the primary input in the hydrological model for the projection of the streamflow for the period of 2016-2100. The flow duration curve analysis of streamflow projections reveals an increase in the discharge for a particular percent of the dependable flow in the case of all the RCP scenarios. Water yield analysis also suggests an increase in the annual average water yield in all cases of emission scenarios.

In addition, ice thickness and formation of potential future lakes were modelled using a distributed model-GlabTop. Our analysis indicated that Drang Drung glacier shrunk by 13.84% from 1971 to 2017. Meteorological projections of temperature and precipitation over region were used to understand climatic changes over Drang Drung region. The snout of the glacier has retreated by 925 m since 1971 at the rate of 21.11 ma(-1). However, the snout retreat radically accelerated since 2014 at 60 ma(-1). Analysis of available satellite data suggested that the proglacial lake formed around 2014. The lake has expanded to 16.62 ha in 2017 amassing a water volume of 2.69 mi m(3) with a potential peak discharge of 2667 m(3) s(-1). Based on GlabTop simulation, the mean thickness of the glacier is 155 m with the highest thickness of 311 m. Climate projections indicate that the temperatures would rise by over 4 A degrees C by the end of this century with insignificant increase in precipitation. GlabTop simulations indicate formation of two huge lakes with areas of 97 and 47 ha in the lower ablation part of the glacier which could pose a risk to the incidence of glacial lake outburst flood in the near future.","[Rashid, Irfan; Majeed, Ulfat] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Rashid, I (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",irfangis@kashmiruniversity.ac.in,,,,,,,,30.0,29.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2018,77.0,12,,,,,,,429,10.1007/s12665-018-7601-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7601-5,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000435763600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

This disaster underlined the high vulnerability of the local population and raised questions regarding the resilience of Kashmiris to future floods. Although the magnitude of the 2014 flood has been considered unprecedented within the context of existing measurements, we argue that the short flow series may lead to spurious misinterpretation of the probability of such extreme events. Here we use a millenniumlong record of past floods in Kashmir based on historical and tree-ring records to assess the probability of 2014-like flood events in the region. Our flood chronology (635 CE-nowadays) provides key insights into the recurrence of flood disasters and propels understanding of flood variability in this region over the lastmillennium, showing enhanced activity during the Little Ice Age. We find that high-impact floods have frequently disrupted the Kashmir valley in the past. Thus, the inclusion of historical records reveals large flood hazard levels in the region. The newly gained information also underlines the critical need to take immediate action in the region, so as to reduce the exposure of local populations and to increase their resilience, despite existing constraints in watershed management related to the Indus Water Treaty.

In India, the Himalayan region suffered substantial economic loss and loss of life in the last couple of decades due to frequent landslides. However, identifying potential landslide hazard zones (LHZ) in eastern Himalayan regions helps to manage better and avoid economic losses. This study mapped LHZ of Mangan block, North Sikkim district, Sikkim state (India) in the eastern Himalayas, using GIS techniques. We carried out a landslide survey and characterized the soils at 1:10,000 scale, and used the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method to map the LHZ using environmental (geology, land use/land cover, rainfall), terrain (elevation, slope, aspect, drainage density, lineament density), and soil (depth, texture, gravel content, erosion, land capability class) parameters. Relative rating values were assigned for the subclasses of each thematic layer based on their corresponding impact on the landslide triggers. Further, within a thematic layer, each class was assigned an ordinal rating from 1 to 9. The LHZ map of the Mangan block was produced based on weighted overly techniques. Higher weight was assigned for more influence, and lower weight was assigned for less influence of landslides. The results showed that high-intensity annual rainfall (similar to 3000 mm), elevation (1000-3000 m), coarse soil texture, strong to steep slope (30-60%), geology (inter-banded Chlorite-sericlie and banded Migmatile), and high drainage density are the main causal factors of landslides. The LHZ map shows that the landslide hazard is moderate at 47%, high at 46%, and very high in 4.5% of the study area. Landslide hazard is high in areas with soils of Ringhim (RGM), Nampatam (NPM), Kazor (KZR), Singhik (SGK), and Siyam (SYM) series than in other soils. The LHZ map was validated using the field observations, and most of the recorded landslides (rockfall, debris flow, slope failure induced soil mass toppling, and earth flow) occurred in the moderate to high LHZs on the map. The LHZ map can be used for landslide hazard prevention, infrastructure development planning, and geo-environmental development in the Mangan block.","[Srinivasan, R.; Suputhra, S.

The study area is located at the Indus River in the Kohistan District within the highly elevated Himalayan terrain. The fragile geologic setup and high tectonic activity make this region favorable to produce frequent slope failures and landsliding events. First, a regional level landslide inventory map was created using GIS and remote-sensing tools. For this a hill shaded topographic map was created by overlapping a topographic map on to a hillshade image extracted from satellite based PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 12.5 m spatial resolution in GIS environment. Numerous past landsides were delineated using the expert driven knowledge of anomalous topographic expression like, crenulated contours, divergent contours, isolated topographic knobs, extended topographic ridges and arcuate headscarf evacuation areas. Total 120 landslides were marked, later a field visit was carried out for the validation of this exercise. The overall efficiency of this work was 85% which indicates that the GIS and remote sensing tools utilized for this study are reliable and effective in producing regional landslide inventory maps. Moreover, the scanline surveys were conducted at few selected locations to generate discontinuities data for the evaluation of slope instability issues by using kinematic analysis in DIPS 7.0 software. The study successfully highlights the usefulness of GIS and RS tools and in combination with kinematic analysis for landslides hazard assessment for mega projects.

Modeling hydrological processes for hilly catchments dominated by snow cover and glaciers is complex and relies on improved calibration and uncertainty analysis methods to standardize the watershed based ecosystem management practices. In this study, a modified curve number (CN) approach has been employed to simulate streamflow and water yield at sub-catchment scale over hundred years utilizing Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which relies on the main physical factors of the ecosystem such as landuse/landcover and soil. The model calibration and validation strength was evaluated using coefficients of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe Equation (NSE) objective functions. The uncertainties (percentage) occurred in the modeled streamflow were estimated using two optimization algorithms such as the Sequential Uncertainty Parameter Fitting Approach (SUFI2) and the Parametric Solution (ParaSol). A parameterization based sensitivity analysis was carried-out to recognize the most influencing model calibration parameters. Statistical downscaling of daily temperature and precipitation datasets was performed utilizing Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase Five (CMIP5) Global Circulation Models (GCMs) with their Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) experiments. The downscaled temperature and precipitation were utilized to assess the climate change impact on streamflows at sub-catchment scale. The historical and projected scenarios of streamflow (at the outlet) and water yield (at sub-catchment scale) showed substantial variabilities in their amount in both temporal (1991-2100) and spatial scales (sub-catchment 1 to sub-catchment 7). The magnitude of change analysis confirmed a substantial increase in the water yield across all the sub-catchments over Himalaya. The percent of change analysis ensured that the magnitude of change of water yield is highly vulnerable in the Himalayan catchments. The GCMs based projected scenarios demonstrated a consistent increase in the streamflow at both outlets (e.g. Lachung and Chungthang).

The area is highly vulnerable to various geological and hydrological disasters stemming from its rugged terrain and geological instability. The recent tragic occurrence of land subsidence caused adverse implications on the infrastructure and local population's sustenance inducing disturbances in environmental, and social facets. This study incorporates a brief review of the current status and plausible causes of land subsidence in Joshimath town. The establishment of the town on the 'debris of ancient landslide,' proximity to major geological discontinuities, tectonically fragile area, and population upsurge are key drivers that appear to have exacerbated the ongoing slope instability and land subsidence. Thus, the present review will aid to encompass further scientific studies to monitor the sinking of ground in such mountainous regions for mitigating land subsidence. Furthermore, it also discusses the consequences of land subsidence and remedial measures, thereby aiding policymakers and concerned authorities to develop risk management plans and therefore enhancing the region's overall resilience to such disasters.","[Singh, Divya; Goyal, Deepesh; Biswakarma, Prakash; Joshi, Varun] Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha Univ, Univ Sch Environm Management, New Delhi 110078, India",,"Goyal, D (corresponding author), Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha Univ, Univ Sch Environm Management, New Delhi 110078, India.",deepesh.usem.012163@ipu.ac.in,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,2023 DEC 9,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10668-023-04263-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-04263-0,,DEC 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001117284100002,View Full Record in Web of Science

RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. Snow precipitation presently comprises 52% of the total annual precipitation and contributes similar to 55% to the annual streamflow with the peak observed in May in the Lidder River. However, projections to the end of twenty-first century under various RCPs indicate that there shall be considerable decrease in both the snow precipitation and snowmelt contribution to the streamflow Moreover, early snowmelt is predicted during spring by the end of the twenty-first century under climate change, which leads to the shifting of streamflow peak from the late spring to early spring in the upstream and from summer to spring in the downstream areas of the basin. The observed streamflow shows a noticeable shift in the streamflow peak after 1990s and is more prominent in the downstream areas of the basin.

Understanding on long-term dynamics and glacier inventory is crucial, particularly for the melt-dominated and latitudinally-diverse western Himalayan glacier basins. In this study, a temporal inventory is prepared for Warwan-sub basin (WSB), utilizing satellite imageries since the 1993 (Landsat TM: 1993; ETM+: 2001, 2008; OLI: 2020) and elevation model (SRTM DEM: 2000). The base inventory was generated for the year 2001 and systematically adjusted to the glacier situations in 1993, 2008, and 2020. Results indicate that in the year 2001, WSB in the western Himalaya included 84 glaciers (> 0.02 km(2)) covering an area of 187.9 +/- 5.8 km(2). The mapping (2001) further revealed a supraglacial debris cover of 15% of the glacierized area (28.2 +/- 0.9 km(2)). Overall, the debris cover increased by 6% between 1993 and 2020. Temporal analyses clearly suggest a period of gain in the glacierized area (2001-2008) interspersed by the two phases of decline (1993-2001 and 2008-2020). Results specify a stronger decline in the glacierized area during 1993 to 2001 (197.03 +/- 6.1 to 187.9 +/- 5.8 km(2)) than between 2008 and 2020 (188.4 +/- 5.9 to 182.8 +/- 5.66 km(2)). Remarkably, the glacierized area increased from 187.9 +/- 5.8 to 188.4 +/- 5.8 km(2) during 2001 to 2008. In view of widespread recession of regional glaciers, the gain in the area between 2001 and 2008 represents a peculiar characteristic of WSB that needs further detailed investigation. Further analyses suggest that low-altitude, east-facing, debris-free, steep-sloped, and small glaciers experienced greater loss in the area than large, debris-covered, north-facing, gently sloped, and high-altitude glaciers. Overall, the study at the sub-basin scale reveals inherent glacier dynamics with periodic increase and decrease in the glacierized area and a notable influence of non-climatic factors in regulating spatial heterogeneity and the rate of glacier changes.","[Garg, Purushottam Kumar] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Ladakh Reg Ctr, Ladakh 194101, Uttaranchal, India; [Malviya, Apoorva] Govt Holkar Sci Coll, AB Rd, Indore 452001, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Shukla, Aparna] Minist Earth Sci, Lodhi Rd,Prithvi Bhavan, New Delhi 110003, India; [Garg, Siddhi] Indian Inst Technol, IDP Climate Studies, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Singh, Nilendu] Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, 33 GMS Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, India; [Malviya, Apoorva] Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttaranchal, India",,"Garg, PK (corresponding author), GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Ladakh Reg Ctr, Ladakh 194101, Uttaranchal, India.",garg.glacio@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2023,195.0,3,,,,,,,390,10.1007/s10661-023-10958-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-10958-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000933242900009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Experimental observations discussed include both atmospheric measurements and data from snow and ice core sampling from different glaciers in the HKH region. The paper focuses on the atmospheric brown cloud loadings over the Himalayas, particularly black carbon (BC) and ozone, which have links to regional climate and air-pollution-related impacts. Studies show elevated levels of anthropogenic ozone and BC over the Himalayas during the pre-monsoon season with concentrations sometimes similar to those observed over an average urban environment. The elevated concentration observed over the Himalayas is thought to come from the lowlands, especially the highly populated areas of the Indo-Gangetic Plains.

The present study intends to assess geotechnical characteristics of identified perilous slide zones for their detailed slope stability analysis in one of the highly complex structural entities of Lesser Himalaya, named as Purola schuppen zone. It involves imbricate thrusting and embraces a number of slide zones in weathered quartzite, phyllite, schist and shales. On the basis of discontinuity characteristics, viz. their orientations and interrelationship with slope, structural attributes and debris materials, slide zones are showing planar, wedge or circular failure patterns. Kinematic analysis is attempted to identify the possible mode of structurally controlled failure in rock mass. As per their failure types, these slide zones are analysed for stability using geotechnical parameters evaluated in lab. For circular failure zones, angle of internal friction and cohesion, are attained quantitatively by direct shear test and varying from 30.8 degrees to 36.8 degrees and from 0.04 to 0.41 kg/cm(2), respectively. In case of planar and wedge failures, modified slope mass rating technique is used that assigns class V status for Kothgaon slide zone indicating very bad rock mass and unstable to completely unstable slope conditions with probability of failure as high as 0.9 while Taluka slide is partially stable with normal rock mass falling in class IV. Factor of safety, estimated by circular failure charts using slope, soil and strength characteristics, is varying from 0.75 to 1.50 in dry conditions, signifying critical stable state while it reduces less than unity in wet conditions as saturation upsurges due to nearby percolation of rainwater through discontinuities and cracks. Imbricate thrust zone, substantial weathering and jointing in rock masses, steep slopes and nearby vicinity to stream channels are major contributory reasons of instability in the area, while road widening and rainfall are acting as catalysts prompting the failure.","[Dudeja, Divya; Bhatt, S.

In this study, we aimed to quantify biomass and C stock partitioning in multiple vegetation strata (tree, shrub, herb, and ground floor layers) of major forest types in Jammu and Kashmir, Western Himalaya, India. We used a stratified random cluster sampling strategy to collect field data in 96 forest stands of 12 forest types (altitudinal range: 350 to 3450 m) in the study region. We evaluated the degree to which the carbon stock of the entire ecosystem was dependent on the multiple vegetation strata using the Pearson method. Across all the forest types, the average total ecosystem-level biomass was estimated to be 181.95 Mgha(-1) (range: 60.64-528.98). Forest strata-wise, the maximum biomass of 172.92 Mgha(-1) (range: 50.64-514.97) was found in the tree vegetation, followed by 5.58 Mgha(-1) (range: 2.59-8.93) in understory vegetation (shrubs and herbaceous), and 3.44 Mgha(-1) (range: 0.97 and 9.14) in the forest floor. The total ecosystem-level biomass showed a peak at mid-elevation coniferous forest types, whereas the lowest was observed in low-elevation broad leaved forest types. At the ecosystem-level, on average, the understory contributed 3% and the forest floor 2% to the total C stock across the forest types. The shrub layer contributed up to 80% of total understory C, with the herbaceous layer accounting for the remaining 20%. The ordination analysis clearly shows that anthropogenic and environmental variables significantly (p <= 0.002) influence the forest types' C stock in the region. Our findings have significant implications for conserving natural forest ecosystems and restoring degraded forest landscapes in this Himalayan region, which in turn can lead to better carbon sequestration and climate mitigation outcomes.","[Haq, Shiekh Marifatul; Khuroo, Anzar Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Ctr Biodivers & Taxon, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu And Kashm, India; [Haq, Shiekh Marifatul; Rashid, Irfan] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu And Kashm, India; [Waheed, Muhammad] Univ Okara, Dept Bot, Okara 56300, Pakistan",,"Khuroo, AA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Ctr Biodivers & Taxon, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu And Kashm, India.",anzarak@uok.edu.in,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2023,195.0,7,,,,,,,812,10.1007/s10661-023-11376-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11376-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001003009000006,View Full Record in Web of Science

These watersheds are increasingly facing anthropogenic and climate-related pressures that impact spatial and temporal distribution of water availability. This study evaluates temporal and spatial distribution of water availability including groundwater recharge and quality (non-point nitrate loadings) for a Himalayan watershed, namely, the Upper Yamuna watershed (part of the Ganga River basin). The watershed has an area of 11 600 km(2) with elevation ranging from 6300 to 600 m above mean sea level. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a physically-based, time-continuous model, has been used to simulate the land phase of the hydrological cycle, to obtain streamflows, groundwater recharge, and nitrate (NO3) load distributions in various components of runoff. The hydrological SWAT model is integrated with the MODular finite difference groundwater FLOW model (MODFLOW), and Modular 3-Dimensional Multi-Species Transport model (MT3DMS), to obtain groundwater flow and NO3 transport. Validation of various modules of this integrated model has been done for sub-basins of the Upper Yamuna watershed. Results on surface runoff and groundwater levels obtained as outputs from simulation show a good comparison with the observed streamflows and groundwater levels (Nash-Sutcliffe and R-2 correlations greater than + 0.7). Nitrate loading obtained after nitrification, denitrification, and NO3 removal from unsaturated and shallow aquifer zones is combined with groundwater recharge. Results for nitrate modeling in groundwater aquifers are compared with observed NO3 concentration and are found to be in good agreement. The study further evaluates the sensitivity of water availability to climate change. Simulations have been made with the weather inputs of climate change scenarios of A2, B2, and A1B for end of the century. Water yield estimates under climate change scenarios have been made and implications on groundwater and groundwater quality have been assessed. The delicate groundwater resource balance that connects livelihoods of millions of people seems to be under tremendously increasing pressure due to the dynamic conditions of the natural environment of the region and the future climate changes.

Most influencial variables that may be linked to habitat suitability of Tragopan, such as bioclimatic variables, land use (forest cover and forest type), soil characteristics, and topographic variables (elevation, slope, aspect, heat load index) were considered to develop a model using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm. MaxEnt is a widely used and accepted tool for modeling species distribution. The model's performance for mapping habitat was evaluated by the Area Under Curve (AUC) (AUC > 90%). The measured TSS value 0.98 and Kappa value 0.71 were elaborated for the aptness of the model for suitable habitat mapping. It was observed that the suitable habitat of the western tragopan would shift towards higher elevations under all RCPs.

To qualify and quantify these effects, long-term land surface temperature observations in both the daytime and nighttime, acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer from 2000 to 2017, were used in this study to investigate the spatiotemporal variations and their changing mechanism. Two periodic parameters, the mean annual surface temperature (MAST) and the annual maximum temperature (MAXT), were derived based on an annual temperature cycle model to reduce the influences from the cloud cover and were used to analyze their trend during the period. The general thermal environment represented by the average MAST indicated a significant spatial distribution pattern along with the elevation gradient. Behind the clear differences in the daytime and nighttime temperatures at different physiographical regions, the trend test conducted with the Mann-Kendall (MK) method showed that most of the areas with significant changes showed an increasing trend, and the nighttime temperatures exhibited a more significant increasing trend than the daytime temperatures, for both the MAST and MAXT, according to the changing areas. The nighttime changing areas were more widely distributed (more than 28%) than the daytime changing areas (around 10%). The average change rates of the MAST and MAXT in the daytime are 0.102 degrees C/yr and 0.190 degrees C/yr, and they are generally faster than those in the nighttime (0.048 degrees C/yr and 0.091 degrees C/yr, respectively). The driving force analysis suggested that urban expansion, shifts in the courses of lowland rivers, and the retreat of both the snow and glacier cover presented strong effects on the local thermal environment, in addition to the climatic warming effect. Moreover, the strong topographic gradient greatly influenced the change rate and evidenced a significant elevation-dependent warming effect, especially for the nighttime LST. Generally, this study suggested that the nighttime temperature was more sensitive to climate change than the daytime temperature, and this general warming trend clearly observed in the central Himalayan region could have important influences on local geophysical, hydrological, and ecological processes.","[Zhao, Wei; He, Juelin; Wu, Yanhong; Xiong, Donghong; Wen, Fengping; Li, Ainong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wei; Wu, Yanhong; Xiong, Donghong; Li, Ainong] Tribhuvan Univ, Chinese Acad Sci, Kathmandu Ctr Res & Educ, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [He, Juelin] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wen, Fengping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,"Li, AN (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Li, AN (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Chinese Acad Sci, Kathmandu Ctr Res & Educ, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhaow@imde.ac.cn; hejuelinftcd@gmail.com; yhwu@imde.ac.cn; dhxiong@imde.ac.cn; wenfp@imde.ac.cn; ainongli@imde.ac.cn,,,,,,,,54.0,57.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2,2019,11.0,8,,,,,,,900,10.3390/rs11080900,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11080900,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000467646800010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Project Stage II and inflow of River Sainj for power generation, and has been contemplated as a peaking station operating in tandem with Stage II. The present study has been undertaken to see the impact of hydroelectric project on the biodiversity, particularly on medicinal plants. A total of 104 species of medicinal plants, belonging to different life forms, i.e., trees (23 spp.), shrubs (22 spp.), herbs (57 spp.) and ferns (2 spp.) were recorded. The species have been analyzed and studied for their distribution, classification, altitudinal zones, part (s) used, indigenous uses, nativity, endemism and rarity. Different parts of these species, such as whole plants, roots (including rhizomes and tubers), leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, barks, spikes, nuts and insect galls are used by the inhabitants for curing various diseases and ailments. 30 species are native to the Himalayan region, 9 species native to the Himalayan region and adjacent countries also and 65 species are non-natives. 9 species are near endemics. Considering the whole Himalaya as a biogeographic unit (sensu lato), the near endemics are endemic to the Himalaya. Among these species, Zanthoxylum armatum is categorized as Endangered and Valeriana wallichii as Vulnerable. Hedychium spicatum, Rhus javanica, Berberis lycium, Thalictrum foliolossum, Salvia lanata, Rubia cordifolia and Bergenia ligulata may be considered as threatened species due to their over exploitation, for trade. go species are propagated by seeds, 8 species by seeds and rhizomes/roots/tubers, 4 species by seeds and cuttings, and 2 species by sori.

Across nine surveyed villages, a total of 30 plants (26 trees, 4 shrubs) were being collected for fuel purpose by the inhabitants. Mean fuelwood collection by households ranged from 2916.4 (kg hh(-1) year(-1)) in high-altitude villages to 1256.6 (kg hh(-1) year(-1)) in low altitude. Among used species, probability of use was maximum for Pinus roxburghii (0.79 high-altitude, 0.89 mid-altitude and 0.82 low-altitude zone). Broadly, the tree species contributed 93.3% (low altitude) to 97.3% (high altitude) of annual fuelwood requirement of households. The quantum of collection was considerably higher from the native species compared to the non-natives.

In recent decades, the frequency of flash floods has considerably increased in the Himalayan watersheds, causing enormous human suffering, infrastructure damage, ecosystem disruption, and economic losses. Considering the exponential rise in the frequency of flash flood events, identifying the Flash Flood Vulnerable Zones (FFVZs) is one of the most crucial findings to limit their negative consequences. In this study, grey fuzzy analytic hierarchy process-based model integrated with the geographic information system is implemented to assess the flash flood vulnerability in the Ranikhola watershed, East Sikkim, India. Additionally, a novel Flash Flood Vulnerability Index (FFVI) is proposed to determine the flash flood vulnerability that takes into account twelve natural and anthropogenic parameters. Further, the FFVI map is classified into three FFVZs: low, moderate, and high. The effectiveness of the methodology implemented is judged by the high EV value (6.4286) and the comparison parameter. The harshest conclusion of this analysis, the major cities, such as Gangtok, Ranipool, and Singtam, are designated high FFVZ.

Despite it, very few studies have focussed on niche distribution and diversity pattern of non-native and native plant species in high mountain communities, and their role in identifying endemic species with high extinction risk in Himalayas. To determine niche width and diversity pattern of species based on the nativity, and ascertain the role of niche width in conservation prioritization of endemic/native species, four sites were selected in western Himalayas. We analysed diversity indices (based on native, non-native, and total species) such as Species richness, Simpson index, Chao-1 index, Whittaker index (?w), and species niche width across the elevational gradient in study sites. Non-native species were found to thrive in lower elevations. The niche width of non-native species declined with increase in elevation, but a few non-native species had a broad niche width (habitat generalist). Such habitat generalist species may lead to the displacement of endemic or native habitat specialist species (having narrow niche width). Species like Aconitum heterophyllum, Aconitum violaceum, Bergenia stracheyi, Dactylorhiza hatagirea, Jurinea dolomiaea, Sinopodophyllum hexandrum, Morina longifolia, and Roscoea alpina etc. were found to have a narrow niche width. Such species will face an extinction risk due to the upward shift of non-native species. The high elevational plant communities are more susceptible to extinction risk due to the accelerated spread of non-native species influenced by climate change. This study emphasizes the crucial need to implement strategies for the control of non-native species, describing species compositional changes at higher elevations, and aids to efficiently identify and conserve native species under high extinction risk.","[Ahmad, Mustaqeem; Sharma, Padma; Singh, Harminder P.] Panjab Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Chandigarh 160014, India; [Rathee, Sonia; Batish, Daizy R.; Kaur, Shalinder; Kohli, Ravinder Kumar] Panjab Univ, Dept Bot, Chandigarh 160014, India; [Lone, Gowher R.] CSIR Indian Inst Integrat Med, Plant Biotechnol Lab, Canal Rd, Jammu 180001, India; [Jaryan, Vikrant] St Baba Bhag Singh Univ, Dept Bot, Jalandhar 144030, Punjab, India",,"Singh, HP (corresponding author), Panjab Univ, Dept Environm Studies, Chandigarh 160014, India.;Batish, DR (corresponding author), Panjab Univ, Dept Bot, Chandigarh 160014, India.",hpsingh_01@yahoo.com; daizybatish@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,18.0,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2021,126.0,,,,,,,,107653,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107653,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107653,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000647804700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lack of monitoring, however, hampers conservation efforts in many regions. The Hindu-Kush Himalaya (HKH) is experiencing rapid environmental change, but impacts on aquatic biodiversity are unknown. Using a unique long-term dataset, we investigated changes to local (alpha) and regional (gamma) fish species diversity across 38 sites on Nepal's Kaligandaki-Narayani River (KNR), and evaluated potential impacts of climate change. Our results indicate a significant decrease in mean abundance and local species richness, although regional diversity did not decline. Species ranges contracted between the 1990s and 2010s, with lower bounds and weighted means shifting to higher elevations. Range shifts coincided with water temperature warming between the 1990s and 2010s, particularly at more speciose lower elevation sites. Although widespread species loss has not yet occurred, decreasing abundance and contraction of species' ranges point to increased extirpation risk in the near future.

The temperature projections from the GFDL CM2.1 model are found in good agreement with the observations; however, no single model investigated in the present study reasonably simulates precipitation and therefore multi-model ensemble is used for precipitation projections.

New data gathered during three years of field campaigns (2012-2014) were used to set up a glacio-hydrologicalmodel describing stream flows, snow and ice melt, ice cover thickness and glaciers' flow dynamics. The model was validated, and used to assess changes of the hydrological cycle until 2100.

Flow statistics are estimated for two reference decades 2045-2054, and 2090-2099, and compared against control run CR, 2012-2014. During CR we found a contribution of ice melt to stream flows of 55% yearly, with snow melt contributing for 19%. Future flows are predicted to increase in monsoon season, but to decrease yearly (-4% vs CR on average) at 2045-2054. At the end of century large reduction would occur in all seasons, i.e.-26% vs CR on average at 2090-2099. At half century yearly contribution of ice melt would be on average 45%, and snow melt 628%. At the end of century ice melt would be 31%, and snow contribution 39%. Glaciers in the area are projected to thin largely up to 6500 m a.s.l. until 2100, reducing their volume by-50% or more, and their ice covered area by -30% or more.

This study focuses on the analysis of monitored high-frequency continuous spring discharge and rainfall data in the contact and fracture type Mathamali spring located in the Garhwal Himalaya. Discharge from the spring and its storage behavior has been studied by analyzing recession components and flow duration curves. Analyzed discharge data revealed that the spring can generate maximum volume during monsoon as compared to winter due to aquifer properties and tendencies to store and transmit water. Springshed intervention practices were implemented in early April 2017. The measured average flow was 16.9 lpm but soon after the interventions, the average flow increased by 2.6 times. The minimum average spring flow was 2.3 lpm which increased by 5 times whereas the average maximum flow increased by 1.8 times. Post-intervention, storage duration has increased by 16%, decaying from 143 lpm (peak flow) to 12.7 lpm (baseflow). The preliminary findings from this spring can be considered as a check for establishing benchmarks for sustainable development of springsheds, climate change adaptation, and development plans to cope up with growing water insecurity in the rural Himalayas.","[Kumar, Vikram; Paramanik, Santosh] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Hydrol, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Kumar, V (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Hydrol, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",25.vikram@gmail.com,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2020,20.0,8,,,,,3380,3392,,10.2166/ws.2020.223,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2020.223,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000617140800035,View Full Record in Web of Science

Twenty-five percent of the geographical area of HP is under forests and harbour ca. 3,400 plant species. The available bioresources not only support the livelihood of nearly 6 million people but also fulfill the forage requirement of 5.2 million livestock. Thus, dependence on bioresources is manifold. Based on field surveys to different localities of HP and analyses of published information, two types of resource use patterns have been identified. One, the direct use of forest resources which is represented by extraction of timber, fuelwood and fodder; and the second represents indirect resource use from the forest that is represented by activities related to agriculture, tourism and industry. Amongst the direct resource use, annual timber requirement of the local people works out to be 310,063 m(3). On the other hand, annual fuelwood and fodder requirement of local people is to the tune of 3,646,348.8 and 10,294,116.5 tons, respectively. Extraction of fodder therefore appears to be one of the main reasons for forest degradation in HP as opposed to timber and fuelwood extraction. However, compared to direct resource use, indirect resource use and pressures have far more pronounced effect on the forests. Of the indirect pressures, shifts in agriculture patterns and increased tourism seem to be the most prominent.","[Uniyal, Sanjay Kr; Singh, Rakesh D.] CSIR, Inst Himalayan Bioresource Technol, Biodivers Div, Palampur 176061, Himachal Prades, India",,"Uniyal, SK (corresponding author), CSIR, Inst Himalayan Bioresource Technol, Biodivers Div, Post Box 6, Palampur 176061, Himachal Prades, India.",suniyal@ihbt.res.in,,,,,,,,6.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2012,184.0,8,,,,,4903,4919,,10.1007/s10661-011-2311-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2311-4,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000305979700022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lakes in mountainous regions are generally small, and therefore more sensitive to natural/human-induced perturbations. In this study, the effect of twentieth century global climate change and human interventions was analysed for Lake Nainital, located in a densely populated valley of Kumaun Himalaya. For this purpose, gridded (0.5(0) x 0.5(0) and 0.25(0) x 0.25(0)) climatic (T-Mean, T-Max, T-Min, DTR and rainfall) data of period 1901-2000 available on monthly time steps were employed for detecting an annual and seasonal pattern of change in the climatic variables in the lake region. The samples of water collected between February 1994 and July 1996 for different months from the lake were used for determining the physical and chemical characteristics of the lake water. The samples were analysed for: field parameters (temperature, pH, EC), major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, SO42- and Cl-), and nutrients (NO3- and PO4-). Results derived from the chemical analysis of water reveal that anthropogenic activities, increased in recent past, have accelerated the deterioration and eutrophication processes of the lake. However, decrease in mean annual and monsoonal rainfall will affect the various components of water balance and may cause reduction in the lake volume in the future.","[Singh, Dharmaveer; Rai, Shive Prakash; Kumar, Sudhir] Natl Inst Hydrol, Hydrol Invest Div, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kumar, Bhishm] IAEA, Div Phys & Chem Sci, Isotope Hydrol Sect, Vienna Int Ctr, Room A2353, Vienna, Austria; [Jain, Sanjay K.] Natl Inst Hydrol, Water Resources Syst Div, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Rai, SP (corresponding author), Natl Inst Hydrol, Hydrol Invest Div, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",sprai1966roorkee@gmail.com,,,,,,,,8.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2016,75.0,20,,,,,,,1380,10.1007/s12665-016-6177-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-6177-1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000386578200043,View Full Record in Web of Science

Habitat characteristics and spatial-temporal occurrence of indicator taxon were investigated with respect to its natural environment. The study includes extensive field surveys, laboratory studies and comparison of historical maps at local scale coupled with literature appraisal at local, regional and global scales. Instability generated due to slope disturbances by natural and anthropogenic activities along the roads, ravines, stream banks, terraces, cultivated land, old landslide sites and human settlements was investigated during the years 2000-2005. It was followed by regional and global scale study during the years 2009-2011. It is established that the instability is manifested by occurrence of indicator species and its spatial dominance delineates the areas of potential instability. The investigated inherent characteristic features of the indicator species viz., rapid growth (145 cm/year), primary succession, nitrogen fixation and obtrapezoid-winged seed structure, roots and suckers morphology and associated microclimatic scenario have been found extremely decisive to the process of manifestation of slope instability. Study at three experimental sites and vicinity also confirmed that wide-spread occurrence of indicator taxon is not related to specific soil and rock type, gradient or aspect but is exclusively attributable to its unstable environment. The indicator taxon has been identified as Alnus nepalensis D. Don and its invasion delay to the unstable slopes was reported by one to two years. Indicator's habitat affinity to instability and its phyto-geographical range was explored between 1000-2590 m asl at local scale in Garhwal Himalaya and 900-2700 m at regional scale in Indian Himalayan and other mountain states viz., Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Assam and Meghalaya, while it is reported between 200 m and 2800 m at global scale in Asian countries like Nepal, Tibet, Bhutan, China, Myanmar and Bangladesh. The proposed ecological approach to identify and delineate the areas of potential hill slope instability seems to be promising and may be termed innovative, as it involves only local resource as a scientific tool and traditional wisdom as technical excellence. Unlike geotechnical methods of slope instability assessment, this being simple, eco-friendly, self sustainable and cost effective, it is socially acceptable and can also be used by non-scientists for planning and management in Himalayan region and similar other regions of the world.

The poor infrastructure and low adaptation capabilities of these nations are the prime concern of current studies. Pakistan is vulnerable to climate-induced hazards including floods, droughts, water shortages, shifts in weather patterns, loss of biodiversity, melting of glaciers, and more in the coming years. For marginal societies dependent on natural resources, adaptation becomes a challenge and the utmost priority. Within the above context, this study was designed to fill the existing research gap concerning public knowledge of climate vulnerabilities and respective adaptation strategies in the northern Hindukush-Himalayan region of Pakistan. Using the stratified sampling technique, 25 union councils (wards) were selected from the nine tehsils (sub-districts) of the study area. Using the quantitative method approach, structured questionnaires were employed to collect data from 396 respondents. The study reveals varying public perceptions about different factors contributing to the causes and impacts of climate change and the sources of information in the three zones of the study area. The primary causes of climate change are deforestation, industrial waste, anthropogenic impurities, natural causes, and the burning of fossil fuels exacerbated by increased population. Changes in temperature, erratic rainfalls, floods, droughts, receding glaciers, and extreme weather events are some of the impacts observed over the past decades. While limiting the indiscriminate use of fossil fuels combined with government-assisted rehabilitation of forests can help combat climate change, the lack of proper education and economic, social, and governance barriers are hindering the local adaptation strategies. In addition, reduce environmental pollution (air, water, soil, etc.) and plantation polluted areas with suitable plants, are the two main actions in combating climate change. This study recommends policy interventions to enhance local adaptation efforts through building capacity, equipping local environmental institutions, discouraging deforestation, and ensuring sustainable use of natural resources.","[Bacha, Muhammad Suleman; Nafees, Muhammad] Univ Peshawar, Dept Environm Sci, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Muhammad, Muhammad] Univ Peshawar, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Muhammad, Muhammad] Govt Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Planning & Dev Dept, Urban Policy & Planning Unit, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Kilic, Zeyneb] Adiyaman Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-02040 Adiyaman, Turkey",,"Kiliç, Z (corresponding author), Adiyaman Univ, Dept Civil Engn, TR-02040 Adiyaman, Turkey.",sulemanbachastd@uop.edu.pk; muhammadstd@uop.edu.pk; zkilic@adiyaman.edu.tr; nafees@uop.edu.pk,,,,,,,,9.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2021,13.0,8,,,,,,,4464,10.3390/su13084464,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13084464,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000645316400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Representative concentration pathway (RCP)-based projections from six dynamically downscaled global circulation models (GCMs) were bias-corrected for developing the climatic projections over the twenty-first century. The uncertainty associated with GCM outputs was addressed by using multi-model ensemble projections developed through Bayesian model averaging (BMA) technique. The assessment reveals that compared to the baseline (1980-2010) values, the annual mean maximum temperature in the basin will rise by 0.41-2.31 & DEG;C and 0.63-4.82 & DEG;C, and the mean minimum temperature will increase by 1.39-2.37 & DEG;C and 2.14-4.34 & DEG;C under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. While precipitation is expected to decrease by 7.2-4.57% and 4.75-2.47% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, correspondingly. BMA ensemble projections were coupled with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate the future hydrological scenarios of the drainage basin. With the changing climate, the discharge of rivers in the Jhelum basin is expected to witness reductions by about 23-37% for RCP4.5 and 19-46% for RCP8.5. Moreover, the water yield of the basin may also exhibit decreases of 17-25% for RCP4.5 and 18-42% for RCP8.5. The projected scenarios are likely to cause water stress, affect the availability of water for diverse uses, and trigger transboundary water-sharing-related conflicts.

Bhalubang-Shiwapur section of Mahendra Highway lying in Western Nepal is one of them. To understand the landslide causative factor and to predict future occurrence of the landslides, landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) of this region was carried out using frequency ratio (FR) and weights-of-evidence (W of E) models. These models are easy to apply and give good results. For this, landslide inventory map of the area was prepared based on the aerial photo interpretation, from previously published/unpublished reposts, and detailed field survey using GPS. About 332 landslides were identified and mapped, among which 226 (70%) were randomly selected for model training and the remaining 106 (30%) were used for validation purpose. A spatial database was constructed from topographic, geological, and land cover maps. The reclassified maps based on the weight values of frequency ratio and weights-of-evidence were applied to get final susceptibility maps. The resultant landslide susceptibility maps were verified and compared with the training data, as well as with the validation data. From the analysis, it is seen that both the models were equally capable of predicting landslide susceptibility of the region (W of E model (success rate = 83.39%, prediction rate = 79.59%); FR model (success rate = 83.31%, prediction rate = 78.58%)). In addition, it was observed that the distance from highway and lithology, followed by distance from drainage, slope curvature, and slope gradient played major role in the formation of landsides. The landslide susceptibility maps thus produced can serve as basic tools for planners and engineers to carry out further development works in this landslide prone area.","[Regmi, Amar Deep] Nepal Acad Sci & Technol, Fac Technol, Lalitpur Khumaltar 44700, Nepal; [Yoshida, Kohki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Geol, Fac Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Pourghasemi, Hamid Reza] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Marine Sci, Tehran 14115335, Iran; [Dhital, Megh Raj] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Geol, Kritipur 44613, Nepal; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Putra Malaysia, Dept Civil Engn, GISRC, Fac Engn, Serdang 43400, Selangor Darul, Malaysia",,"Regmi, AD (corresponding author), Nepal Acad Sci & Technol, Fac Technol, Lalitpur Khumaltar 44700, Nepal.",amardeep_regmi@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,80.0,82.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2014,11.0,5,,,,,1266,1285,,10.1007/s11629-013-2847-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-013-2847-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000342223500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding public perceptions of climate change is thus crucial to both identifying problems and delivering solutions. Investigations of climate change that integrate instrumental records and people's perceptions in the Himalayas are scarce and fragmentary compared to other regions of the world. We analyzed nationally representative data (n=5060) of local peoples' perception of climate change in Nepal, and assessed annual and seasonal trends of temperature and precipitation, onsets of seasons, and trends of climate extremes, based on gridded climate datasets. We firstly used quantitative and spatial techniques to compare local perceptions and the instrumentally observed trends of climate variables. We then examined the possible association of demographic variables, place attachment, regional differences, and prior understanding of climate change with the accuracy of people's perceptions. Instrumental evidence showed consistent warming, increasing hot days and nights, and increasing annual precipitation, wet spells, heavy precipitation and decreasing dry spells in Nepal. Our results indicate that locals accurately perceived the shifts in temperature but their perceptions of precipitation change did not converge with the instrumental records. We suggest that, in future as exposure to changes in weather, particularly extreme events, continues, people may become more likely to detect change which corresponds with observed trends.

This study investigated the vulnerability status and prevalent adaptation strategies of urban slum dwellers in Dehradun, Indian Himalayas, using a pre-tested questionnaire covering household characteristics and indicators of vulnerability, in face-to-face interviews with the head of 122 randomly selected households in four slums. We found that overall vulnerability was very high, with very low absorptive and coping capacity for potential impacts of climate change. Moreover, vulnerability and coping strategies were socially differentiated in terms of the decision-making capability and resource capacity of households. Two groups per category (good and bad decision makers; poor and poorer households) were distinguished. The exposure dimension of vulnerability differed significantly by resource capacity and decision capability. However, the sensitivity dimension of vulnerability did not differ between the groups, while the adaptive capacity dimension of vulnerability differed depending on decision-making capability. In designing appropriate strategies for long-term disaster mitigation for urban slums, it is thus important to address slum socio-ecology and the capability and capacity of slum dwellers.","[Pandey, Rajiv; Gupta, Ajay K.; Kumar, Manoj] FRI, Dehra Dun, India; [Alatalo, Juha M.] Qatar Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar; [Thapliyal, Kavita; Chauhan, Sharmila] Doan Univ, Dehra Dun, India; [Archie, Kelli M.] Victoria Univ Wellington, Sch Geog Environm & Earth Sci, Climate Change Res Inst, Wellington, New Zealand; [Jha, Shashidhar Kumar] HNB Garhwal Univ, Srinagar, Uttarakhand, India",,"Pandey, R (corresponding author), FRI, Dehra Dun, India.",rajivfri@yahoo.com; jalatalo@qu.edu.qa; kelli.archie@vuw.ac.nz,,,,,,,,50.0,52.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2018,90.0,,,,,,379,391,,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.03.031,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.03.031,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000440266100039,View Full Record in Web of Science

More detailed studies on specific glaciers and the drivers of reported changes are essential to comprehend small-scale differences in the effects of climatic warming on Himalayan glaciers. We computed elevation changes and surface flow distribution for 205 (>= 0.1 km2) glaciers in the Alaknanda, Bhagirathi, and Mandakini basins, all located in the Garhwal Himalaya, India. This study also investigates a detailed integrated analysis of elevation changes and surface flow velocities for 23 glaciers with varying characteristics to understand the impact of ice thickness loss on overall glacier dynamics. We observed significant heterogeneity in glacier thinning and surface flow velocity patterns using temporal DEMs and optical satellite images with ground-based verification. The average thinning rate was found to be 0.07 +/- 0.09 m a-1 from 2000 to 2015, and it increased to 0.31 +/- 0.19 m a-1 from 2015 to 2020, with pronounced differences between individual glaciers. Between 2000 and 2015, Gangotri Glacier thinned nearly twice as much as the neighbouring Chorabari and Companion glaciers, which have thicker supraglacial debris that protects the beneath ice from melting. The transitional zone between debris-covered and clean ice glaciers showed substantial flow during the observation period. However, the lower reaches of their debris-covered terminus areas are almost stagnant. These gla-ciers experienced a significant slowdown (similar to 25 %) between 1993-1994 and 2020-2021, and only the Gangotri Glacier was active even in its terminus region during most observational periods. The decreasing surface gradient reduces the driving stress and causes slow-down surface flow velocities and an increase in stagnant ice. Surface lowering of these glaciers may have substantial long-term impacts on downstream communities and lowland populations, including more frequent cryospheric hazards, which may threaten future water and livelihood security.","[Bhambri, Rakesh; Sain, Kalachand; Tiwari, Sameer K.; Yadav, Jairam Singh] Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Bhambri, Rakesh; Schmidt, Susanne; Nuesser, Marcus] Heidelberg Univ, South Asia Inst SAI, Dept Geog, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Chand, Pritam] Cent Univ Punjab, Sch Environm & Earth Sci, Dept Geog, Bathinda 151401, Punjab, India; [Nuesser, Marcus] Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg Ctr Environm HCE, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Haritashya, Umesh] Univ Dayton, Dept Geol & Environm Geosci, 300 Coll Pk, Dayton, OH 45469 USA",,"Bhambri, R (corresponding author), Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India.",rakeshbhambri@gmail.com,,,,,,,,12.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1,2023,875.0,,,,,,,,162625,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162625,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.162625,,MAR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000955826900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, three systematic sampling campaigns were conducted in the Koshi River Basin (KRB) during the post-monsoon, pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. Hg speciation and distribution of river water were analyzed among the different seasons for a total of 88 water samples. The total Hg (THg) concentration of surface water in the KRB ranged from 0.64 to 32.96 ng.L-1 with an average of 5.83 +/- 6.19 ng.L-1 and decreased in the order of post-monsoon (8.79 +/- 7.32 ng.L-1) > monsoon (6.68 +/- 6.12 ng.L-1) > pre-monsoon (2.18 +/- 1.29 ng.L-1). Particulate Hg (PHg) accounted for 63% of THg on average and had a positive correlation with THg among all the three sampling seasons, indicating that the differences in PHg concentration were likely one of the main factors leading to the seasonal and spatial variations in THg in the KRB surface water. The annual Hg exports and fluxes were estimated to be 339.04 kg and 3.88 mu g.m(-2).yr(-1), respectively. Furthermore, Hg export from the KRB had significant seasonal variation and decreased in the order of monsoon (259.47 kg) > post-monsoon (61.18 kg) > winter (9.31 kg) > pre-monsoon (9.08 kg), and this pattern was mainly related to seasonal changes in river runoff. The annual Hg export is projected to increase in the future, especially in the post-monsoon season.

The continuous rainfall from 2 to 6 September, 2014 caused a massive landslide at village Sadal in Udhampur district of Jammu and Kashmir state. The landslide occurred in the early morning of September 6, 2014, destroying entire Sadal habitation comprising 45 houses, and killing 41 people and more than 500 domestic animals. Google earth images of pre and post-landslide events along with the field measurements show the kinematics of upper and lower parts of the slide. Horizontal and vertical components of displacement and mode of failure suggest the landslide as of complex nature. The shallow subsurface geophysical imaging through Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey shows the failure plane composed of friable mudstone bed underlain by massive mudstone and overlain by cross-bedded sandstone. The depth of debris material above the failure plane ranges from 6 m at Site S la-b to 10 m at Site-S2b and 20 m at Site S3a. The velocity analysis of Site-3 shows four thick layers represented from bottom to surface by Ll-sandstone (V=0.16 m/ns, travel time = 356.36 ns), L2-mudstone (V=0.17 m/ns, travel time =288.48 ns), L3-massive mudstone (V=0.19 m/ns, travel time 220.68 ns), and L4-cross-laminated sandstone (V=0.20 m/ns, travel time = 77.58 ns) overlaying the failure plane. The study shows the landslide occur along the western limb of a fold identified during the present work. We mapped an old landslide on the same limb which shows 5-6 m-thick subsurface debris material with thick rock fragments involved in the landslide process.

There are 9575 glaciers spread over the Indian Himalaya from northwest to its eastern limits (Sangewar C.V. and Shukla S.P., 2009. Inventory of the Himalayan glaciers - a contribution to the International Hydrological Programme (an updated edition) [Spl. Pub., No. 34]. Kolkata: Geological Survey of India, 588.). Approach to glaciers is often difficult and hazardous and is a constraint in undertaking frequently field-based studies. Moreover, majority of these glaciers is unapproachable. Besides glaciers, de-glaciated regions are the potential areas for generation of glacier-related hazards, viz. ice avalanches, rock fall, glacial-lake outbursts (GLOF), blocking of rivers especially due to surging glaciers, avalanches or a debris fall, etc. and is a cause of concerns to the downstream area with ongoing climate change scenario. Remote sensing techniques, especially in its modern outlook having a sub-metre resolution have altogether changed the present scenario for glacier/snow-related studies. Once the type area within a basin is studied with conventional field techniques (Mukherjee, B.P. and Sangewar C.V., 1996.

The studies that can be undertaken with remote sensing includes geomorphology and palaeoglaciation studies, recessional pattern of glaciers in different climatic zone and altitude wise, mass balance of glaciers in a catchment and regionally, documenting surging glaciers, glacier induced hazards in different regions, etc. However, applications of remote sensing should not be used indiscriminately, and a vast field exposure is a must before attempting such studies to avoid possible inaccuracies.

Most of analyzed parameters had statistically significant (p < 0.05) correlation among them. Water quality and heavy metal pollution indices of samples ranged from 22.84 to 235.69 and 22.30 to 235.92, respectively. Except for Cd and Zn, concentrations of Pb, Cr, Cu, and Fe were found to be higher than permissible limits. Hazard quotient for oral and dermal exposures and overall hazard indices for heavy metals were < 1, signifying negligible non-carcinogenic risk. However, carcinogenic risk due to exposure to Cr among adults and children was 3.25 x 10(-4) and 4.05 x 10(-4), respectively, i.e., > 1 per 10,000 inhabitants indicating a high carcinogenic risk.

It is predicted to be a rise in the average annual temperature of over 4 degrees C, and an increase in the average annual precipitation of over 26% by the end of the 21st century under RCP 8.5 scenario. Modeling results show these will lead to significant changes in the basin's water balance and hydrological regime. In particular, a 50% increase in discharge is expected at the outlet of the basin.

In the tectonic setting predominated by compression and strike-slipping, active faults are dominant and result in the genesis of the great alpine relief together with fluvial incision and unloading. In this section, with a distance of about 290 kin between Ranwu and Lulang, 34 landslides occurred. Among them, the 12 large and super-large landslides comprise the most dangerous part of the highway system to road users over the past 50 years. The landslides usually occurred in slopes comprised of moraine with a large thickness, fluvio-pluvial and lacustrine deposits and fractured rocks. Based on the examination of the physical geography, structural geology, Quaternary geology, stratigraphy and petrography, this paper presents the temporal-spatial distribution of landslides along the section and classification of them into three types with respect to mechanism and composites of landslides. Type 1. Landslide initiated at high elevation and transformed into a distal debris flow damming the river I with a long reoccurrence interval Type 2. Landslide at stream banks, in different ranks of mass movements in dissecting layers of moraines Type 3. Landslide of fractured rock mass with quick translation movements. Each of the three types is presented by distinctive case examples. Type 1 is Yigong Landslide; type 2 includes Dongjiu Landslide group, 102 Landslide group, Suotong Landslide group, Songzong Landslide; and the type 3 is Layue Landslide. A binary landslide, which is seldom seen in nature and which occurred in the outlet of one creek under the integrative function of fluvial incision and road cut, is also presented. These are distributed in different parts of the area with characterized structural geology, topography and composites (gneiss and Quaternary deposits) with accumulative quantity between Suotong and Dongjiu. The most occurred with frequent and rapid translation, shallow shearing planes, various influential factors and unique triggering factors, and a variable period of reoccurrence with a tendency of increasing magnitude. In this region, six influential factors greatly contribute to their occurrence: (a) intensive neotectonic movements, (b) ongoing alpine canyon relief, (c) earthquakes, (d) heavy precipitation, (e) stream erosion, and (f) human activities, to a certain extent. Mostly, the latter four factors play major roles in triggering landslide occurrence. The earthquake causes the rock and soil to fracture and deform, and tends to be unstable, or cause earth-induced landslides. The heavy rainfall in monsoon seasons which saturates the soil and lower the shearing strength is mostly responsible for the occurrence of landslides. The stream erosion disturbs slope toes causing progressive failure. Road construction and deforestation decrease the natural slope stability. Comments and suggestions on the physical measures for remediation of landslides and safety of highways are also made.","Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Sch Civil Urban Geosyst Engn, Seoul 151744, South Korea; Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem & Geophys, Key Lab Engn Geomech, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Xian 710054, Peoples R China",,"Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Engn, Sch Civil Urban Geosyst Engn, Seoul 151744, South Korea.",,,,,,,,,19.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2005,48.0,6,,,,,721,741,,10.1007/s00254-005-0012-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-005-0012-4,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000233034300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among these important prey species, pikas are considered especially vulnerable to rising temperatures that would impede their surface activity and dispersal. We investigated how climatic regimes influence the niche of the Royle's pika (Ochotona roylei), and which climatic drivers and change trajectories may threaten the species' future sustenance, thereby prioritizing areas for future conservation of this species across its distribution range. We used Royle's pika presence locations in the MaxEnt framework, along with biologically relevant climatic and topographical variables, to model the present (2010) and the future (2050, 2070) climatic niche under different future scenarios projected by CCSM4 climatic models. Subsequently, we estimated the climatic niche loss across the elevation gradient, longitudinal gradient, and both inside and outside protected areas for all countries within the species' range. Niche suitability of the Royle's pika was substantially determined by precipitation of the coldest quarter (~snow cover) and wettest quarter (~monsoon rainfall). As these parameters are known to be vulnerable to global climatic change, our projection revealed significant loss (102 km(2)/year) in the species niche availability across all future scenarios, particularly in non-protected low-elevation regions. By identifying areas where species survival may be threatened, we confirmed that the distribution of Royle's pika, an important prey species, might be reduced by climate change. Our findings can aid in conservation planning strategies for this species and other alpine fauna and contribute to ongoing efforts to monitor change in the Himalaya.","[Bhattacharyya, Sabuj; Mungi, Ninad Avinash; Rawat, Gopal Singh; Adhikari, Bhupendra Singh; Wilkening, Jennifer Lee] Wildlife Inst India, Dept Habitat Ecol, Dehradun (city), India; [Bhattacharyya, Sabuj] Indian Inst Sci, Centre Ecol Sciences, Bangalore, India; [Kawamichi, Takeo] Kansai Wildlife Assoc, Osaka, Japan",,"Bhattacharyya, S (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, Dept Habitat Ecol, Dehradun (city), India.;Bhattacharyya, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Centre Ecol Sciences, Bangalore, India.",bhattacharyyasabuj@gmail.com,,,,,,,,10.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2019,19.0,8,,,,,2423,2435,,10.1007/s10113-019-01556-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-019-01556-x,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000511753200021,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a consequence, the species has already become endangered, facing enhanced threats of regional extinction. To compound this, the species shows high vulnerability to climate change impacts that may significantly reduce its present climatic niche. In spite of the ecological and enormous commercial importance of the species, the direct or indirect impacts of climate change on the species are not yet well-researched and well-documented. To develop sustainable adaptation pathways to conserve the surviving populations of the species, it is important to have precise assessments of the future distribution ranges of the species. The present study models the potential current and future distribution ranges of Taxus wallichiana based on its suitable climatic envelop developed under a baseline scenario (1960-1990) and climate change scenarios centred on representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the year 2070, as provided in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the UNO's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The projected shrink in climatic niche of Taxus wallichiana by 28% (RCP 4.5) and 31% (RCP 8.5) highlights the vulnerability of the endangered species to climate change impacts and the perturbations on the structure of mountain ecosystem.

Their increasing population and spread to new areas is of growing concern for the long-term viability of wildlife species. Hence, it is imperative to understand the factors responsible for their infestation and map areas where native species are most vulnerable. Using the random forests algorithm, we modelled the free-ranging dog infestation in the Trans-Himalayan region to pinpoint the high-risk areas where free-ranging dogs are threatening the native wildlife species. We found that the likelihood of free-ranging dog occurrence is most in valley regions and up to 4000 m, often in proximity to roads. Our results also indicated that free-ranging dog prefers areas with wildlife near to protected areas. The predictor variables, such as potential evapotranspiration of the coldest quarter, distance to protected areas, elevation, distance to roads, and potential evapotranspiration of the driest quarter, significantly influence the distribution of the free-ranging dogs. We found that within the Ladakh region of the Trans-Himalayan area, the high-risk zones for free-ranging dogs are located in and around Hemis National Park, Karakoram Wildlife Sanctuary, and Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary. While, in the Lahaul and Spiti region the high-risk areas encompass Pin Valley National Park, Inderkilla National Park, Khirganga National Park, Kugti Wildlife Sanctuary, and several other protected areas. We identified the potentially high-risk areas for implementing strategies to mitigate the possible impact of free-ranging dogs on native wildlife of the Himalayas. Hence, the identified high priority areas can be used for implementing actions for controlling the population growth and further preventing the infestation of the free-ranging dogs into the new areas.","[Dar, Shahid Ahmad; Sharief, Amira; Kumar, Vineet; Singh, Hemant; Joshi, Bheem Dutt; Bhattacharjee, Saurav; Dutta, Ritam; Dolker, Stanzin; Singh, Amar Paul; Singh, Vinaya Kumar; Thakur, Mukesh; Sharma, Lalit Kumar] Zool Survey India, Kolkata 700053, West Bengal, India; [Sharief, Amira; Kumar, Vineet] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Sharief, Amira] WSL, Swiss Fed Res Inst, Zurcherstr, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Sidhu, Avtar Kaur] High Altitude Reg Ctr, Zool Survey India, Solan 173211, Himachal Prades, India",,"Sharma, LK (corresponding author), Zool Survey India, Kolkata 700053, West Bengal, India.",lalitganga@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2023,195.0,11,,,,,,,1386,10.1007/s10661-023-11972-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11972-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001092105200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

For biogeographically vital and extremely heterogeneous regions like Himalaya, assessing vulnerability as an inherent characteristic becomes crucial. The present study assesses the inherent vulnerability (IV) for farming communities of Himachal Pradesh as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity using social and ecological indicators, group-decision methods, and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools. Data for 13,877 villages in three different biogeographical zones (Lower Himalaya (LH), Middle Himalaya (MH), Trans-Himalaya Tibetan Plateau (THTP)) was collected from secondary sources. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) was applied to weigh the social and ecological indicators. Weighted indicators were finally aggregated to generate the final inherent vulnerability index (IVI). The IVI values for different biogeographical zones (LH 0.35 + 0.13, MH 0.42 + 0.14 and THTP 0.30 + 0.17) reveal that geographical location of zones played a decisive role in distribution of IV. MH showed the highest vulnerability due to fragile inherent biophysical and socio-economic conditions.

Hydropower generation and fisheries are likely to be impacted annually and over the century by seasonal, as well as long-term changes, in hydrological conditions. In order to quantify the effect of climate changes on hydropower and fisheries, we developed an integrated assessment framework that links biophysical models (positive degree-day model, hydrologic model, run-of-river power system model, and fishery suitability index) and economic models. This framework was used to demonstrate the framework's utility for gaining insights into the impacts of changed river flow on hydropower and fisheries of the Trishuli River in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) Region (from the Hindu Kush and Tien Shan mountain ranges in the west to the Eastern Himalaya). Remotely sensed and in situ data were used to quantify changes in snow and glacier melt in Langtang glacier and resultant change in hydrologic flow in the Trishuli River upstream of the Trishuli hydropower plant. Future discharges were projected using climate data derived from the Cubic Conformal Atmospheric model with 50-km resolution in Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 and RCP 4.5 climate scenarios. Results suggest that, in the future, the Trishuli River will experience modest increases in the economic value of the hydropower resource and fisheries as a result of higher snow and glacial melt. Increased flow in the months of March and April attributed to increased glacier melt translated to an increase in electricity generation. However increased flow in June and July when the snow and glacial melt peak is coupled with monsoon precipitation could not be fully utilized due to hydropower plant capacity constraints. Fishery suitability in the Trishuli River would be greater than 70% of optimal under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Power economic results do not vary significantly for the next thirty years because flow increases under RCP 8.5 and resultant energy production are more pronounced in the later part of the century. The framework utilized in this study can be expanded in the future to analyze hydropower infrastructure as well as fisheries conservation in the upstream HMA basins from Afghanistan through Bhutan.","[Mishra, Shruti Khadka; Hayse, John; Veselka, Thomas; Yan, Eugene; LaGory, Kirk] Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 S Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60564 USA; [Kayastha, Rijan Bhakta] Kathmandu Univ, Ward 7,POB 6250, Kathmandu, Nepal; [McDonald, Kyle; Steiner, Nicholas] CUNY City Coll, MR 925,160 Convent Ave & W 138th St, New York, NY 10031 USA",,"Mishra, SK (corresponding author), Argonne Natl Lab, 9700 S Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60564 USA.",mishra@anl.gov,,,,,,,,17.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2018,87.0,,,,,,102,111,,10.1016/j.envsci.2018.05.006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2018.05.006,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000437066600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The communities of Himalayan mountains are facing challenges of food security owing to lack of the resource information for meeting their water requirements. In this study, suitability index approach was adopted to assess glacier resource potential for establishing kuhl irrigation system in HKH ranges of Pakistan. The basis of indexing is glacier accessibility and water yield potential of the glacial resource for irrigation estimated in terms of number and ice reserve of the glaciers. The suitability index was found good for about 1.4% glaciers constituting about 80% of the total ice reserves of the HKH region. Medium suitability constitutes about 36.1% glaciers with 12.6% of the total ice reserves, while low suitability was assessed for about 60% glaciers containing 1.5% ice reserves only. Maximum unit glacial reserve was estimated for Shigar basin, i.e., 1.44 km(3), and among HKH ranges, 0.46 km(3) for the Karakoram range.

This study presents the first temporal inventory of glacial and high-altitude lakes in the Sikkim, Eastern Himalaya for four points in time i.e., 1975, 1991, 2000, and 2017 using Hexagon, TM, ETM+, and OLI images, respectively. First, a baseline data was generated for the year 2000 and then the multi-temporal lake changes were assessed. The annual mapping of SGLs was also performed for four consecutive years (2014-2017) to analyze their nature and occurrence pattern. The results show an existence of 463 glacial and high-altitude lakes ( > 0.003 km(2)) in 2000 which were grouped into four classes: supraglacial (SGL; 50) pro/peri glacial lake in contact with glacier (PGLC; 35), pro/peri glacial lake away from glacier (PGLA; 112) and other lakes (OL; 266). The mean size of lakes is 0.06 km 2 and about 87% lakes have area < 0.1 km(2). The number of lakes increased (by 9%) from 425 in 1975 to 466 in 2017, accompanied by a rapid areal expansion from 25.17 +/- 1.90 to 31.24 +/- 2.36 km(2)(24%). The maximum expansion in number (106%) and area (138%) was observed in SGLs, followed by PGLCs (number: 34%; area: 90%). Contrarily no significant change was found in other lakes. The annual SGL mapping reveals that their number (area) increased from 81 (543,153 m(2)) to 96 (840,973 m(2)) between 2014 and 2017. Occurrence pattern of SGLs shows that maximum number of lakes ( > 80%) are persistent in nature, followed by drain-out (15-20%) and recurring type lakes (7-8%). The new-formed lakes (9-17%) were consistently noticed in all the years (2014-2017). The results of this study underline that regional climate is accelerating the cryosphere thawing and if the current trend continues, further glacier melting will likely occur. Therefore, formation of new lakes and expansion of existing lakes is expected in the study area leading to increase in potential of glacial lake outburst floods.

The results revealed mildly alkaline pH (8.40 +/- 0.43) with the pattern of average ionic dominancy: Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ and HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3- for cations and anions, respectively. Gibbs diagram implied that the lithogenic weathering mainly controlled the solute acquisition process, which was further confirmed by the Piper diagram, exhibiting Ca-HCO3 as the governing hydrochemical facies (91%). The average molar ratios were 0.88, 8.33, and 6.86 of (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/TZ(+), (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/(Na+ + K+), and HCO3-/(Na+ + K+), respectively, which specified that the carbonate weathering largely controlled the solute acquisition processes with a minor contribution of silicates. The mass budget calculation also confirmed the dominance of carbonate weathering (72.0%, 78.9%, and 62.0% in Pre-Monsoon, Monsoon, and Post-Monsoon, respectively) and the high monsoon rainfall's dilution effect to anthropogenic input of cations. Principal component analysis and correlation matrix exhibited that the major sources of ions in the basin were geogenic with minor anthropic signatures. Furthermore, water quality in connection to drinking and irrigation uses revealed that the basin has mostly retained its natural water quality.

Varunawat Parbat overlooking Uttarkashi town witnessed a series of landslides on 23 September 2003 and the debris slides and rock falls continued for 2 weeks. This landslide complex was triggered due to the incessant rainfall prior to the event, and its occurrence led to the blockage of the pilgrim route to Gangotri (source of the Ganges river) and evacuation of thousands of people to safer places. Though there was no loss of lives due to timely evacuation, heavy losses to the property were reported. High-resolution stereoscopic earth observation data were acquired after the incidence to study the landslide in detail with emphasis on the cause of the landslide and mode of failure. Areas along the road and below the Varunawat foothill region are mapped for landslide risk. It was found that the foothill region of the Varunawat Parbat was highly disturbed by man-made activities and houses are dangerously located below steep slopes. The potential zones for landslides along with the existing active and old landslides are mapped. These areas are critical and their treatment with priority is required in order to minimise further landslide occurrences.","[Kumar, K.

For the first time, this work is reporting substantial ground subsidence in the fifth largest city of Pakistan. Observation of surface deformation using the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS), Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique on Sentinel-1A data -sets from 2015 to 2019 show subsidence up to 3.23 cm. Geologically, this region is going through active deformation associated with Himalayan orogeny. From August 1973 till December 2018, around ten thousand low-to moderate-magnitude earthquakes are reported.We used the emerging hot spot analysis on InSAR and earthquake data to assess the role of seismicity on subsidence. Four variables were analyzed; ground displacement measured by InSAR, earthquake count, earthquake depth, and earthquake magnitude. Analysis of InSAR data indicates that the vast majority of the area is subsiding. This investigation also reveals that earthquake activity near Peshawar is decreasing. In contrast, the earthquake activity is unstable but high in the direction of Tarbela Dam, which is the world's largest earth-filled dam.No systematic groundwater monitoring program has been implemented, and limited published data suggest that the water demand quadrupled in the last decade. A decline in the water table is also reported. Optimized hot spot analysis of water pumping data for 2017 shows a few isolated mild hot spots in the urban center. Excessive groundwater demand and Land-use change from agriculture to urban may have played a significant role in land subsidence in this region.(c) 2023 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

However, they lack long-term systematic monitoring and thus their responses to recent climatic change still remain only partially understood. This study investigated lake extent fluctuations in the HKHT regions over the past 40 years using Landsat (MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI) images obtained from the 1970s to 2014. Influenced by different regional atmospheric circulation systems, our results show that lake changing patterns are distinct from region to region, with the most intensive lake shrinking observed in northeastern HKHT (HKHT Interior, Tarim, Yellow, Yangtze), while the most extensive expansion was observed in the western and southwestern HKHT (Amu Darya, Ganges Indus and Brahmaputra), largely caused by the proliferation of small lakes in high-altitude regions during 1970s-1995. In the past 20 years, extensive lake expansions (similar to 39.6% in area and similar to 119.1% in quantity) were observed in all HKHT regions. Climate change, especially precipitation change, is the major driving force to the changing dynamics of the lake fluctuations; however, effects from the glacier melting were also significant, which contributed approximately 31.9-40.5%, 16.5-39.3%, 12.8-29.0%, and 3.3-6.1% of runoff to lakes in the headwaters of the Tarim, Amu Darya, Indus, and Ganges, respectively. We consider that the findings in this paper could have both immediate and long-term implications for dealing with water-related hazards, controlling glacial lake outburst floods, and securing water resources in the HKHT regions, which contain the headwater sources for some of the largest rivers in Asia that sustain 1.3 billion people.","[Yang, Xiankun] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiankun] Guangzhou Univ, Rural Nonpoint Source Pollut Comprehens Managemen, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xixi] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Lu, Xixi] Inner Mongolia Univ, Inner Mongolia Key Lab River & Lake Ecol, Hohhot 010021, Peoples R China; [Park, Edward] Nanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Tarolli, Paolo] Univ Padua, Dept Land Environm Agr & Forestry, Viale Univ 16, I-35020 Legnaro, PD, Italy",,"Yang, XK (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Yang, XK (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Rural Nonpoint Source Pollut Comprehens Managemen, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yangxk@gzhu.edu.cn; geoluxx@nus.edu.sg; epark@ntu.edu.sg; paolo.tarolli@unipd.it,,,,,,,,16.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1,2019,11.0,9,,,,,,,1082,10.3390/rs11091082,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11091082,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000469763600090,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Sikkim, agriculture is being practiced by 80% of the rural population, and having no other major livelihood options has created immense pressure on the farmers and agricultural land. Agriculture sector is under great stress as the farmers are being confronted by various challenges in Sikkim Himalaya in recent years, such as land degradation, climate change and socio-economic problems. Despite the number of indigenous agriculture management methods being practised in Sikkim Himalaya, the agricultural production system is weakening. In this context, this paper presents an analysis of challenges faced by indigenous communities, local farmers and potential sustainable strategies for their management in Rani Khola watershed of Sikkim Himalaya. Data and information were collected by field observation, questionnaire surveys of 300 households, key informant interviews and focus group discussions conducted during 2017-18. Data processing and analysis were carried out with a combination of techniques, such as the application of remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS)-based data processing and descriptive statistics. Major challenges identified in the watershed are water scarcity (80%), climate change (88%), soil erosion and runoff (72%), higher investment cost (100%), lack of irrigation facilities (77%), fragmentation and size of landholdings (100), human-wildlife conflict (59%) and pests and disease (60%). Some possibilities and innovations that could address these problems are the use and retaining of various indigenous soil and water conservation (SWC) measures, diversified farming systems, community involvement in the government development process, better irrigation facilities, strengthening the local economy, coordinated planning between stakeholders and development of market feedback mechanism within the system.","[Mishra, Prabuddh Kumar] Univ Delhi, Shivaji Coll, Dept Geog, New Delhi 110027, India; [Rai, Aman; Rai, Suresh Chand] Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Dept Geog, New Delhi 110027, India; [Abdelrahman, Kamal] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Geol & Geophys, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Tiwari, Anuj] Univ Illinois Syst, Discovery Partners Inst, Chicago, IL 60606 USA",,"Mishra, PK (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Shivaji Coll, Dept Geog, New Delhi 110027, India.",prabuddh@shivaji.du.ac.in; amanrai.ar29@gmail.com; khassanein@ksu.edu.sa; scrai@geography.du.ac.in; anujt@uic.edu,,,,,,,,13.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2021,13.0,19,,,,,,,11112,10.3390/su131911112,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su131911112,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000726470600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Impact of changing climate on cryosphere can be measured critically from glacier movement due to global warming. Due to complex terrain and unpredictable weather, it is not feasible to measure glaciers' velocity and movement through field surveys physically. For this purpose, the current study aimed to assess the variation of glaciers velocity using advance geospatial technique like the co-registration and correlation (COSI-CORR) of optically sensed satellite images. Time-series analysis on the Landsat-8 data (2013-2020) revealed successfully for computing the surface ice velocity of glaciers of Hunza Basin. Results show that the velocity of a glacier increases with the altitude whereas speed decreases at the terminus. Moreover, it has been noted from spatial patterns of glacier surface ice velocity that the tributary glaciers contribute to the mainstream glacier velocity significantly, which increases at the terminus. Subsequently, the varying ice velocity was determined by orientation, debris cover, glacier size, and altitude for glaciers. The study recommended to regularly monitor the dynamics of glaciers in this region to cater the impacts of global warming and climate change.","[Iqbal, Shahid; Ahmad, Sajid Rashid] Univ Punjab, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lahore 54590, Pakistan",,"Iqbal, S (corresponding author), Univ Punjab, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.",shahidiqbal0506@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,2023,32.0,3,,,,,2141,2154,,10.15244/pjoes/159356,http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/159356,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000972727900015,View Full Record in Web of Science

This region harbors two species of geographically separated brown bear (Ursus arctos) - the Tibetan (U. a. pruinosus) and Himalayan brown bear (U. a. isabellinus). Both serve as important umbrella species, providing many ecological benefits to their surrounding ecosystems. However, how these two species from the same taxonomic group but with distinct geographical ranges, will respond to climate and land use change is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to predict the potential impacts of future climate and land use change on the distribution and dispersal paths of Tibetan and Himalayan brown bears in the HKH region. We applied MaxEnt modeling to predict the distribution of the two bear species both currently and for the year 2070, using three General Circulation Models and three scenarios of climate and land use change. We then identified potential dispersal paths using Circuit Theory. Results showed that both species would be negatively affected by the climate and land use change expected in the 2070s. In all three climate scenarios, their distribution areas would both shrink and shift to higher altitudes. Throughout the HKH region, Tibetan and Himalayan brown bears were predicted to lose over 34% and 32% of currently inhabited area under the most severe climate scenario, respectively. In addition, results showed that the density of dispersal paths for Tibetan brown bear would decrease while dispersal resistance would increase, and that dispersal paths for Himalayan brown bears would shift to higher latitudes. To protect these species, the cur-rently suitable distribution areas and dispersal paths should be considered as priority protected areas. Our find-ings provide a scientific basis for allocating protected areas in the HKH region that are effective under the context of global climate change, and for establishing transboundary cooperation in the HKH region.

Near surface ground temperature data recorded during September 2016 to August 2017 using 24-miniature temperature data loggers distributed across 12 plots and covering an elevation range of 4700-5612 m a.s.l. are used in this study. Permafrost characteristics including plausible ranges of thermal offset, active-layer thickness and mean annual ground temperature at 10 m depth were estimated by driving a one-dimensional heat conduction model. Two statistical models were used to map first order estimates of permafrost area in this 15.4 km(2) catchment. Study suggest permafrost occurrence at all sites above 4900 m a.s.l. with active-layer thickness ranging from 0.1 to 4.2 m and the mean annual ground surface temperature ranging from between -10.0 and -0.85 degrees C for these sites. MAAT at these sites range from -4.1 to -8.9 degrees C and the surface offsets vary from -1.1 to 3.9 degrees C. Estimated thermal offset range from -0.9 to 0 degrees C. Both statistical models show comparable results and suggest 95% mean permafrost cover in the catchment above 4727 m a.s.l. These results strongly indicate existence of significant permafrost areas across the high elevations of the cold-arid regions of IHR. So far, permafrost processes are not considered for assessing present and future estimates of water and regional climate and as a causative factor for disasters like debris flows and landslides in the region.

SOC stocks exhibited high variability and ranged between 28.85 and 94.76 Mg C ha(-1), with mean value of 54.52 Mg C ha(-1), which was stored as 30.63, 22.98, 21.06, 14.89, and 10.41%, respectively at five depths. Differences in SOC stocks between pasture and non-pasture types were minor, with average stocks appearing slightly higher for pasture (59.69 +/- 15.43 Mg C ha(-1)) than non-pasture (56.32 +/- 17.01 Mg C ha(-1)). However non-pasture type had higher stocks particularly in upper soil layers. SOC exhibited negative relationship with soil depth and bulk density while increasing relationship with altitude, species richness and aboveground live and dead biomass was observed. On depth gradient, altitude affected subsurface (10-20cm) soils more distinctly than surface (0-10 cm) soils. Besides contributing baseline data, comparison of SOC provides possibility to determine management effects on SOC storage and consequently C sequestration.","[Dad, Javaid M.] Cent Inst Temperate Hort, Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Dad, JM (corresponding author), Cent Inst Temperate Hort, Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",ss.sajad@gmail.com,,,,,,,,7.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 4,2019,10.0,2,,,,,149,162,,10.1080/17583004.2019.1568137,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2019.1568137,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000468369600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The climate of the Himalayas is vulnerable and interlinked with global-scale climate changes, and the hydrology of the region mainly depends on the cryosphere. This is the first study that has created glacier and glacier lake inventory that links the impact of cryosphere on streamflow to land system dynamic changes under the changing climate of the Upper Jhelum River Basin (UJRB) of the Kashmir Himalayan region. This study uses a series of satellite data (1980-2016) to assess the depletion of snow cover area (SCA), deglaciation, and dynamics of glacial lakes. Moreover, observational long-term hydrometeorological data were used to understand the variability in temperature, precipitation, and track changes of land system dynamics under depletion of streamflow. The results suggested an overall rise in temperature (T-Max = 0.05 oC a(-1); T-Min = 0.02 oC a(-1); T-avg = 0.06 oC a(-1)) and a decrease in precipitation (2.9 mm a(-1)) between 1980 and 2016 with a significant increase in annual average temperature and decrease in annual precipitation at stations located at higher altitudes. The SCA showed a significantly decreasing (p < 0.01) trend in the glacierized sub-basins with an annual rate of decrease of -0.78% a(-1), -0.15% a(-1), -0.03% a(-1) -0.90% a(-1) for Lidder, Sindh, Vishow, and Rambiara sub-basins, respectively. The findings of this study reveal the high occurrence of glacier disintegration and deglaciation. During the period 2010-2016, a rapid rate of deglaciation was observed (18.34 +/- 0.14 km(2)), followed by 1992-2000 (15.61 +/- 0.13 km(2)). The average rate of retreat was observed to be 6.81 +/- 1.5 m a(-1) with a total retreat of 267 +/- 80 m during 1980-2016, which is higher than reported from surrounding mountain ranges in the Himalayas. The mapped 244 glacial and high-altitude lake inventory covers a total surface area of around 15 km(2), with 5.87 km(2) (40%) covered by 25 bedrock-dammed lakes. The glacial expansion and creation of new lakes are observed to be because of increasing glacier and snow melting between 1980 and 2016, which increases the risk of GLOF events in the future. The annual average discharge in UJRB significantly increased from 1991 to 1998 and was observed to be higher than the annual average of the respected gauge stations but shows significant depletion from 1998 onwards. The streamflow depletion under climate change is one of the reasons for land system dynamics in UJRB. The area under agriculture has decreased up to 63% with a massive expansion of built-up (399%), aquatic vegetation (523%), and plantation (765%) between 1992 and 2015.","[Dar, Tanveer; Rai, Nachiketa] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kumar, Sudhir] Natl Inst Hydrol, Hydrol Invest Div, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Bhat, Mohd Aadil] Tianjin Univ, Sch Earth Syst Sci, Inst Surface Earth Syst Sci, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",,"Dar, T (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",tdar@es.iitr.ac.in,,,,,,,,11.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022,194.0,3,,,,,,,140,10.1007/s10661-022-09766-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-09766-3,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000750850200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results show that, although the area under foodgrain crops has not increased, their yields have not declined as much as is often perceived. In some cases, crop productivity has increased. This evidently implies that mountain farmers are maintaining productivity of foodgrain crops for food security reasons. Results also suggest increasing trends in crop diversification toward horticultural and cash crops. Present trends in rapid expansion of areas under these crops indicate the growing importance of horticultural and cash crops in mountain farming systems and the household economy across the Hindu Kush-Himalaya. These trends have positive implications for the future development of mountain agriculture in terms of harnessing mountain niches and comparative advantages. In the livestock sector, there is a general decline in the cattle population across the HKH. Trends indicate the possibility of greater development of smallholder dairies with improved buffaloes in the Himalayan subtropics. The number of stall-fed buffaloes and goats is rising with increased use of external inputs and purchased feed, thus contributing positively to food security and nutrition in mountain households.","ICIMOD, Mt Farming Syst Div, Katmandu, Nepal",,"ICIMOD, Mt Farming Syst Div, GPO Box 3226, Katmandu, Nepal.",tulachan@icimod.org.np,,,,,,,,31.0,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2001,21.0,3,,,,,260,267,,10.1659/0276-4741(2001)021[0260:MAITHK]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/0276-4741(2001)021[0260:MAITHK]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000171081000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ensemble models were developed using a geospatial database containing 45 historical landslides (1074 points) and thirteen influencing variables characterizing the topography, geology, land use/cover, and human activities of the study area. The performance of the models was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and several other performance metrics, including positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity (SST), specificity (SPF), accuracy (ACC), and root mean square error (RMSE). The Bagging-RBFC model with PPV = 86%, NPV = 95%, SST = 95%, SPF = 87%, ACC = 91%, RMSE = 0.297, and AUC = 98% was found to be the most accurate model for the prediction of landslide susceptibility, followed by the Dagging-RBFC, Decorate-RBFC, and single RBFC models.

Srinagar district has been inundated numerous times, since it emerged after the discharge of the large Karewa Lake from the Jhelum valley. In September 2014, cumulative effect of the south-west monsoon and the western disturbances, i.e., the storms that originate in the Caspian or Mediterranean Sea and deliver non-monsoon rainfall to north-west India, exasperated the discharge of Jhelum River, causing widespread inundation in the Kashmir valley. In this research, flood susceptibility zonation of Srinagar district using weights-of-evidence (WofE), frequency ratio (FR) and fuzzy gamma operator (FGO) has been carried out in a geographic information system. WofE and FR models are applied as autonomous data-driven techniques. FGO, on the other hand, is applied in the FR-based objective version and decision-makers knowledge-based subjective version. The novelty of the present study is that it augments FGO with subjective knowledge of a group of decision-makers using a fuzzy simple additive weighting system. Thirteen flood conditioning factors were considered for analysis including elevation, slope, slope aspect, profile curvature, plan curvature, Topographic Wetness Index, Stream Power Index, Sediment Transport Index, Topographic Roughness Index, geology, Modified Fournier Index, Land Use/Land Cover and distance from natural streams. In order to create and validate flood susceptibility index (FSI) maps, a flood inventory database obtained by digital change detection analysis of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images was segmented into training and test datasets and utilized for developing and validating the maps. All the resultant maps rationally illustrate the spatial susceptibility of the Srinagar district to flood. Area under the curve (AUC) was used to calculate prediction and success rates in order to determine the efficacy of the proposed methodologies. It shows that all FSI maps have 'good' success and prediction performance. However, the FR map has the highest success rate (AUC = 0.873), while the subjective FGO map achieves the highest prediction performance (AUC = 0.869). As such, the study reveals that the accuracy standards of FGO could be enhanced by means of incorporating of the subjective judgment.

The landslide is a compound slide i.e. a slump in the crown portion, and debris slide and fall in the lower part. The bedrock consists of gneisses and schists of the Saryu Formation of the Almora Group of Precambrian age. The presence of several small slump scars and debris slide/fall scars along the length of the slide indicates continuous downward movement. The radon concentrations in the present study are much lower in comparison to values reported from other regions. However, the present radon data show relative variation in the slide zone. The concentration of radon measured in landslide zones varies from 3.1 Bq/l to 18.4 Bq/l in spring water and from 2.3 kBq/m(3) to 12.2 kBq/m(3) in the soil gas of the debris. Along the section of the slide, the radon values in water and soil are slightly higher in the upper slopes i.e. toward the crown portion of the landslide as compared to the distal portion. The relatively low concentration of radon both in soil gas and water in the toe portion of the landslide may be due to the high porosity of the debris, which does not allow radon to accumulate in the soil and water, whereas, towards the crown portion, the high frequency of fractures increases the surface area due to particle size reduction, and the near absence of debris enhances the radon emanation in soil.","Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; HNB Garhwal, Dept Phys, New Tehri 249001, India",,"Choubey, VM (corresponding author), Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, 33 Gen Mahadeo Singh Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",vchoubey1@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,,19.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2005,47.0,6,,,,,745,750,,10.1007/s00254-004-1196-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-004-1196-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000228548900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Himalayan region and quaternary geological surface of Indian sub-continent had experienced several earthquakes in the recent geological period due to reactivation of existing faults. Surface drainage system and its morphometric characteristics are controlled by subsurface geo-structural features and active tectonic process which have greater impact on seismic activity. Thus, the present study focuses on the analysis of morphometric parameters for the development of Relative Active Tectonic Index (RATI) and its significant for seismic hazard assessment using geoinformatics. The different morphometric parameters have been analyzed and geospatial databases have been generated. The RATI has been estimated by considering higher priority tectonic influencing parameters based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods and the output has also been integrated with thematic and seismological databases to understand its significance for seismotectonic activity. The result shows that the very high and high Relative Active Tectonic Index are observed in greater and lesser Himalayan sequence, where frequency of earthquake and its magnitudes are also high. The anomalous nature of drainage network, compressed meander in youthful stage, presence of high resistance rocks, structural control on drainage network, relief steepness, and v-shaped narrow valley are the indicator of active tectonics and seismic activity in this region. Even though the foothills micro-basin shows moderate or low Relative Active Tectonic Index, morphometric analysis depicts that it is highly elongated in nature with significant surface tilt and have a greater influence of tectonic deformation. In addition, the continuous stress from Main Frontal Thrust has a significant role for the landscape upliftment and seismic activity in this region. The micro-basin which is located in the quaternary alluvial surface, has not produced any major earthquake in the past, but has greater influence on tectonic activity and may produce earthquake in the future.","[Ghosh, Snehasish; Sivakumar, R.] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Fac Engn & Technol, Earthquake Res Cell, Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India; [Ghosh, Snehasish; Sivakumar, R.] SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India",,"Ghosh, S (corresponding author), SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Fac Engn & Technol, Earthquake Res Cell, Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India.;Ghosh, S (corresponding author), SRM Inst Sci & Technol, Fac Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India.",snehasishghosh.s@ktr.srmuniv.ac.in; sivakumar.r@ktr.srmuniv.ac.in,,,,,,,,10.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2018,77.0,17,,,,,,,600,10.1007/s12665-018-7787-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7787-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000443416300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the eastern Tanggula Mountains, which are the only area where lake-terminating glaciers are found within the Tibetan Plateau, have received little attention to date. In this study, to address this gap, we generated updated glacier boundaries and estimated the interdecadal area changes for 2000-2020 based on the interpretation of Landsat-5/8 and Sentinel-2 images. In addition, based on the method of digital elevation model (DEM) differencing, we quantified the changes in glacier thickness and mass balance using TanDEM-X radar data and SRTM DEM over almost the same periods. The final results show that the glaciers in the eastern Tanggula Mountains, as a whole, have experienced accelerated area shrinkage (with a rate of area loss increasing from -0.34 +/- 0.83 km(2) a(-1) to -0.93 +/- 0.81 km(2) a(-1) for 2000-2013 and 2013-2020, respectively) and accelerated ice thinning (changing from -0.19 +/- 0.05 m a(-1) and -0.53 +/- 0.08 m a(-1) for 2000-2012 and 2012-2020, respectively). Furthermore, the region-wide glacier mass balance was -0.16 +/- 0.04 m w.e. a(-1) and -0.45 +/- 0.07 m w.e. a(-1) for these two sub-periods, corresponding to a 1.8 times acceleration of mass loss rate. The average mass balance during 2000-2020 was -0.23 +/- 0.04 m w.e. a(-1), which is equivalent to a rate of mass loss of -0.04 Gt a(-1). More specifically, within the region, the lake-terminating glaciers have exhibited more significant acceleration of area loss and mass loss, compared to the land-terminating glaciers. However, interestingly, the average thinning rate of the lake-terminating glaciers is always lower than that of the land-terminating glaciers over all study periods, which is in contrast with previous findings in other high mountain areas (e.g., the Himalaya Mountains). Field study and proglacial lakes monitoring suggest that the local topography plays a vital role in the evolution of the glacial lakes in this region, which further affects the glacier changes. Furthermore, the present status of the glacier changes in this region can be attributed to the long-term increase in air temperature. Our findings provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of glacier changes across the eastern Tanggula Mountains and will help to improve the understanding of the heterogeneous response of glaciers to climate change.","[Zhou, Yushan; Li, Xin; Zheng, Donghai; Guo, Yanlong] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Tibetan Plateau Data Ctr TPDC, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaolong] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yingzheng; Ren, Shanshan] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",,"Li, X (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Tibetan Plateau Data Ctr TPDC, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yszhou@itpcas.ac.cn; xinli@itpcas.ac.cn; zhengd@itpcas.ac.cn; zxl1986@itpcas.ac.cn; wangyzh20@lzu.edu.cn; renshsh20@lzu.edu.cn; guoyl@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,5.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2022,14.0,3,,,,,,,506,10.3390/rs14030506,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14030506,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000756498700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its impacts are recognized at different scales ranging from global to regional to local. Climate change particularly changes in temperature and precipitation has been observed differently in different ecological regions in Nepal Himalaya. The study area comprises five villages of three ecological regions in the Gandaki River Basin (GRB) of Nepal. Based on the observed climate data of a 30-year period from 1990 to 2020, the changes in temperature and precipitation of each ecological region are analyzed using the Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope. The temperature trend was found to be increasing at the rate of 0.0254 degrees C per year (degrees C/a) between 1990 and 2020 in the Mountain region, by 0.0921 degrees C/a in the Hill region and 0.0042 degrees C/a in the Tarai region. The precipitation trend in the Mountain region is decreasing by -13.126 mm per year (mm/a), by -9.3998 mm/a in the Hill region and by -5.0247 mm/a in the Tarai region. Household questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews and focus group discussions were carried out to assess the perception of climate change and its impact. The farmers of the three ecological regions have perceived increasing temperature trends, but perceived variability in precipitation trends. Both snowfall and rainfall have varied. Snowfall has drastically decreased. Drought has increased. Extreme disaster events and impacts from such climate-induced events are experienced by 67.9% of respondents. A major impact of climate change is reported on cultivated crops with damage caused by increased insect and rodent pests. The impact of climate change is varied by ecological region. The comparative study of observed data and household data shows the need for a micro-level study so that a real situation can be captured and would be very much useful for policy formulation to combat climate change at a local scale.","[Paudel, Basanta; Chapagain, Prem Sagar; Shrestha, Shobha; Banskota, Tibendra Raj; Poudel, Khagendra Raj] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Geog, Kathmandu 44613, Nepal; [Paudel, Basanta; Zhang, Yili; Liu, Linshan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yili] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jianzhong] Southwest Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China; [Rai, Suresh Chand] Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Dept Geog, Delhi 110007, India; [Islam, Md.

A field study during ablation period was carried out to measure streamflow and suspended sediment concentration (SSC). Further, HBV model was used to estimate the snowmelt. The average seasonal streamflow and SSC during the gauging period (July to October) for the basin were measured to be 7.17 m(3)/s, and 1.52 g/l in 2018, and 6.84 m(3)/s, and 1.21 g/l in 2019, respectively.

Similarly, glacier melt contributes to 32.62% of its total runoff share in 2018 which was reduced to 28.73% in 2019. The rainfall runoff in total runoff increased to 12.62% from 2018 to 2019. Rainfall-runoff in its total runoff contribution showed an increased share of 22.13% in 2019. The streamflow, SSC, and suspended sediment load (SSL) showed a strong positive correlation for both the years.

In the present study, temporal Landsat satellite images, acquired in the years of 1977, 1999, 2001, 2007, 2009 and 2014, were used to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the selected glaciers in the Hunza Valley, northern Pakistan, including the Batura, Passu, Ghulkin and Gulmit. The glaciers outlines were extracted using NDSI and slope gradient, followed by manual editing. The Landsat-derived glacier inventories were verified through the fine-resolution WorldView-2 satellite image and field observations. Evaluating the temporal glacier inventories reveals that the selected glaciers are retreating; however, the melting rate is varying depending on the supra-glacier debris cover. The melting or advancing of glacier is also influenced by the mean annual temperature and precipitation records.

Secondary data were acquired from concerned government departments. Descriptive statistical analysis and spatial analysis techniques were applied to explore 2010 flood disaster causes and damages. Analysis revealed that the flood was generated by the 4-day wet spell (27-30 July 2010) in headwaters zone of the Himalaya-Hindu Kush region, Pakistan. This rainstorm generated heavy discharge in the Indus River system. In several cases, river discharge exceeded the carrying capacity of dams and barrages, and as a consequence, many structures were damaged. In the study area, this heavy flow has left no choice for the flood dealing authorities, but to breach the left bank marginal embankment at RD 32-38 near Kot Addu. Overtopping of the flood on breached section has disrupted the entire area and incurred heavy losses to standing crops, livestock, and physical infrastructure. As a consequence, it has put heavy burden on local community and the country's economy. The analysis further indicated that the total estimated economic loss caused by this imposed inundation was about 2.54 million US$. Infrastructure was the leading sector with maximum estimated economic loss of l.65 million US$ followed by the agricultural sector.

We closely examine ground-based high-quality observations of aerosol characteristics including radiative forcing from several locations in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), the Himalayan foothills and the Tibetan Plateau, relatively poorly studied regions with several sensitive ecosystems of global importance, as well as highly vulnerable large populations. This paper presents a state-of-the-art treatment of the warming that arises from these particles, using a combination of new measurements and modeling techniques. This is a first-time analysis of its kind, including ground-based observations, satellite data, and model simulations, which reveals that the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) in the atmosphere is clearly high over the IGP and the Himalayan foothills (80-135 Wm(-2) per unit aerosol optical depth (AOD)), with values being greater at higher elevations. AOD is >0.30 and single scattering albedo (SSA) is similar to 0.90 throughout the year over this region. The mean ARFE is 2-4 times higher here than over other polluted sites in South and East Asia, owing to higher AOD and aerosol absorption (i.e., lower SSA). Further, the observed annual mean aerosol induced atmospheric heating rates (0.5-0.8 Kelvin/day), which are significantly higher than previously reported values for the region, imply that the aerosols alone could account for >50 % of the total warming (aerosols + greenhouse gases) of the lower atmosphere and surface over this region. We demonstrate that the current state-of-the-art models used in climate assessments significantly underestimate aerosol-induced heating, efficiency and warming over the Hindu Kush - Himalaya - Tibetan Plateau (HKHTP) region, indicating a need for a more realistic representation of aerosol properties, especially of black carbon and other aerosols. The significant, regionally coherent aerosol induced warming that we observe in the high altitudes of the region, is a significant factor contributing to increasingair temperature, observed accelerated retreat of the glaciers, and changes in the hydrological cycle and precipitation patterns over this region. Thus, aerosols are heating up the Himalayan climate, and will remain a key factor driving climate change over the region.","[Ramachandran, S.] Phys Res Lab, Ahmadabad, India; [Ramachandran, S.; Rupakheti, Maheswar; Lawrence, Mark G.] Helmholtz Ctr Potsdam, Res Inst Sustainabil, Potsdam, Germany; [Cherian, Ribu] Univ Leipzig, Leipzig Inst Meteorol, Leipzig, Germany; [Lawrence, Mark G.] Univ Potsdam, Inst Environm Sci & Geog, Potsdam, Germany",,"Ramachandran, S (corresponding author), Phys Res Lab, Ahmadabad, India.",ram@prl.res.in,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 10,2023,894.0,,,,,,,,164733,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164733,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164733,,JUN 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001058071400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Further, gender and other contextual conditions also influence and are influenced by socioeconomic drivers of change to produce differential gendered vulnerabilities.

A stratified random sampling approach was adopted to collect the field data from each forest. A total of 39 tree species belonging to 31 genera and 23 families were recorded from the sampling area (6 forest stands x 10 plots in each). Lauraceae with 5 species was the largest family while Quercus (4 species) emerged as the largest genus. Species-area curve (asymptote) predicted more species than the observed number of species. Cluster analysis has shown that the two Abies pindrow dominant forest stands had the highest similarity in tree species composition. The tree stem density ranged from 540-1170 ha(-1), basal area 23.01-55.94 m(2) ha(-1), Shannon-Wiener diversity index 1.69-2.49, evenness index 0.42-0.74, beta diversity 0.40-0.82 and similarity index 0.17-0.54 in the six studied forests. Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) identified four distinct tree communities in the study area with Daphniphyllum himalayense, Abies pindrow, Quercus oblongata, and Pinus roxburghii as indicator species of corresponding communities. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ascertained the TWINSPAN results and revealed the relation of tree species with environmental and edaphic variables. The phytosociological attributes of tree species varied from one forest stand to another; however, the tree species richness, density, and diversity peaked at intermediate elevation on the north aspect. Findings reveal that tree composition and diversity in the montane forests of Garhwal Himalaya are influenced by both environmental (elevation and slope aspect) and soil variables (texture, water holding capacity, moisture content, available N, exchangeable P, and pH). This study will help in understanding the forest distribution across the western Himalaya, guiding the conservationists and policymakers in carrying out conservation-related management activities, designing the long-term monitoring studies and assessing the effects of ongoing and future climate change and disturbances.","[Rawat, Dinesh Singh; Tiwari, P.; Tiwari, J.

The current study used a trait-based approach to evaluate the impact of local habitat heterogeneity (soil physico-chemical properties) on C. arvense. Thirteen plant functional traits (root, shoot, leaf, and reproductive traits) of C. arvense were studied in three different habitat types (agricultural, marshy, and roadside). Functional trait variability in C. arvense was higher between, than within habitats (between different populations). All the functional traits interacted with habitat change, except for leaf count and seed mass. Soil properties strongly affect C. arvense's resource-use strategies across habitats. The plant adapted to a resource-poor environment (roadside habitat) by conserving resources and to a resource-rich environment (agricultural and marshy land habitat) by acquiring them. The ability of C. arvense to use resources differently reflects its persistence in introduced habitats.

Nevertheless, the assurance of their effectiveness in reducing vulnerability is not always certain, and there are instances where they may worsen the situation by promoting maladaptive outcomes. Despite its significant implications for sustainable development, empirical research has not thoroughly examined this issue. To bridge this knowledge gap, the present study undertook a comprehensive assessment of farmers' adaptation measures and the subsequent maladaptive outcomes in the Eastern-Himalayan foothills of West Bengal, India. The investigation encompassed household surveys, engaging with local stakeholders, and conducting an exhaustive review of relevant literature. This comprehensive approach led to the identification of various maladaptive outcomes, including the decline of groundwater levels, heightened emissions of greenhouse gases stemming from diesel-powered irrigation systems, the emergence of pest resistance, increased investment costs, financial losses, disruptions to social cohesion arising from alterations in cultural practices, among others. The study highlighted that climatic factors do not exclusively drive maladaptation; rather, they can be influenced by factors such as pre-existing vulnerabilities, disregard of socio-cultural norms, inadequate consideration of long-term implications, and the negligence of cost-effectiveness in adaptation endeavors. In light of these findings, the study argues for adopting more inclusive adaptation measures that yield multifaceted benefits conducive to achieving sustainability.","[Datta, Pritha; Behera, Bhagirath] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Kharagpur 721302, India; [Datta, Pritha] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Datta, Pritha] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Dept Policy & Management Studies, New Delhi 110070, India",,"Datta, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Kharagpur 721302, India.;Datta, P (corresponding author), Asian Dev Bank Inst, Tokyo, Japan.;Datta, P (corresponding author), TERI Sch Adv Studies, Dept Policy & Management Studies, New Delhi 110070, India.",dattapritha3@gmail.com; bhagirath9@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,2023 OCT 9,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10668-023-03925-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-03925-3,,OCT 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001080599700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The modelling algorithm used in the paper is Maxent (maximum entropy) which has estimated the target probability distribution by finding the probability distribution of Maxent. After projection of modelled bioclimatic layers to future climate scenario of SRES-A1B in Maxent, it was found that the suitable bioclimatic envelope for Rhododendron has shrunk considerably under the envisaged climate change scenario. The results on extent and locations of Rhododendron distributions in both the current and future climate scenarios provide a deep insight to the conservation planners about the kind of strategy that needs to be adopted for conserving Rhododendrons in the face of climate change.

The current study evaluated night-soil compost (NSC) for agricultural use by assessing the compost quality, safety, and microbiome properties. Based on the fertility and clean indices determined by the fertility and heavy metal parameters, NSC was categorized as good quality compost with high fertilizing potential and moderate concentration of heavy metals. With respect to pathogens, the faecal coliform levels in the NSC were categorized as safe according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards. The bacterial community structure based on 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed a diverse taxonomy with 14 phyla and 54 genera in NSC. Compared to publicly available 16S rRNA gene amplicon data, NSC exhibited predominant phyla (Proteobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes) similar to human faeces, cattle manure, food waste compost, vermicompost, and activated sludge. However, statistically, NSC was distinct at the genus level from all other groups. Additionally, pathogenic bacteria with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in the NSC metagenome were determined by performing a standalone BLASTN against the PATRIC database. The analysis revealed 139 pathogenic strains with most pathogens susceptible to antibiotics, indicating lower AMR in the predicted strains. The phytotoxicity of NSC with Pisum sativum var.

The PM2.5 samples were col-lected and analysed for the duration from Jan 2020 to Feb 2021.The seasonal mean concentrations of PM2.5 and PAHs were observed to be high during autumn and low during summer season. Overall, the annual mean concentration of PM2.5 was found higher than the prescribed limit of World Health Organization and National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The concentration of the 16 individual PAHs were found to be highest during autumn season (55.26 +/- 37.15 ng/m3). Among the different PAHs, the annual mean concentration of fluorene (3.29 +/- 4.07 ng/m3) and naph-thalene (1.15 +/- 3.76 ng/m3) were found to be the highest and lowest, respectively. The Molecular Diagnostic Ratio (MDR) test reveals higher contribution from heavy traffic activities throughout the winter and autumn seasons. The other possible sources identified over the region are fossil fuel combustion, and biomass burning. The multivariate sta-tistical analysis (Multifactor Principal Component Analysis) also indicates a strong association between PM2.5 /PAHs and meteorological variables across the region in different seasons. The precipitation and wind pattern during the study period suggests that major contribution of the PM2.5 and PAHs were from local sources, with minimal contribu-tion from long-range transport.

Here we used an ensemble modelling approach to predict the distribution of three important species of Abies namely, Abies pindrow, Abies spectabilis and Abies densa in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region under the current and two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP245 and SSP585) and time periods of 2050 and 2090s. A correlative ensemble model using presence/absence data of the three Abies species and 22 environmental variables, including 19 bioclimatic variables and 3 topographic variables, from known distributions was built to predict the potential current and future distribution of these species. The individual models used to build the final ensemble performed well and provided reliable results for both the current and future distribution of all three species. For A. pindrow, precipitation of the driest month (Bio14) was the most important environmental variable with 83.3% contribution to model output while temperature seasonality (Bio4) and annual mean diurnal range (Bio2) were the most important variables for A. spectabilis and A. densa with 48.4% and 46.1% contribution to final model output, respectively. Under current climatic conditions, the ensemble models projected a total suitable habitat of about 433,003 km(2), 790,837 km(2) and 676,918 km(2) for A. pindrow, A. spectabilis and A. densa, respectively, which is approximately 10.36%, 18.91% and 16.91% of the total area of Hindu Kush Himalayan region. Projections of habitat suitability under future climate scenarios for all the shared socioeconomic pathways showed a reduction in potentially suitable habitats with a maximum overall loss of approximately 14% of the total suitable area of A. pindrow under SSP 8.5 by 2090. A decline in total suitable habitat is predicted to be 9.6% in A. spectabilis by 2090 under the SSP585 scenario while in A. densa 6.67% loss in the suitable area is expected by 2050 under the SSP585 scenario. Furthermore, there is no elevational change predicted in the case of A. pindrow while A. spectabilis is expected to show an upward shift by about 29 m per decade and A. densa is showing a downward shift at a rate of 11 m per decade. The results are interesting, and intriguing given the occurrence of these species across the Hindu Kush Himalayan region. Thus, our study underscores the need for consideration of unexpected responses of species to climate change and formulation of strategies for better forest management and conservation of important conifer species, such as A. pindrow, A. spectabilis and A. densa.","[Malik, Rayees A.; Reshi, Zafar A.; Rafiq, Iflah] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Singh, S.

It is highly valued for its aromatic wood, popularly called agar, which has been overexploited in its natural range. The natural habitat of Agarwood is also drastically changing due to anthropogenic activities, and the tree is no longer in existence in the wild except in some intact forest patches. In the Indian East Himalayan region, Agarwood is planted in indigenous agroforestry and communal lands. Here, species distribution modelling (SDM) was used to establish Agarwood's current and future habitat suitability under two representative climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We implemented an ensemble of five SDM models, including two regression and three machine learning methods, using datasets from 82 locations. The results revealed that of the total area of 269,159 km(2 )of the Indian East Himalayan region, 2282 km(2 )is currently highly suitable. However, it is predicted to decrease by 34.28% under RCP4.5 and 14.64% under RCP8.5 by 2050, whereas 44.88% of the highly suitable area would reduce under RCP4.5 and 27.18% under RCP8.5 by 2070. Under the current climate scenario, the state of Assam has a substantial area potentially suitable for Agarwood, representing 99.21% of the state's land area (2264 km(2 )). However, there will be a tremendous loss of suitable habitats in future climate change scenarios. Our study highlights that precipitation of the driest quarter, precipitation of the warmest quarter and mean temperature of the driest quarter were the most influential bioclimatic variables. In addition, sand, clay content and organic carbon density were critical predictors of the distribution of Agarwood. This study has provided baseline data on the potentially suitable habitat of the species to guide the formulation and implementation of policies and practices for the conservation of Agarwood in the Indian East Himalayan region.","[Hazarika, Animekh; Nath, Panna Chandra; Nath, Arun Jyoti; Das, Ashesh Kumar] Assam Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Silchar, Assam, India; [Deka, Jyotish Ranjan] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttaranchal, India; [Sileshi, Gudeta W.] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Biodivers Management, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Giri, Krishna] Indian Council Forestry Res & Educ, Dehra Dun, Uttaranchal, India",,"Nath, AJ (corresponding author), Assam Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Silchar, Assam, India.",arun.jyoti.nath@aus.ac.in,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2023,32.0,14,,,,,4787,4803,,10.1007/s10531-023-02727-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-023-02727-3,,OCT 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001085918200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Heavy rainfall often falls over the foothills, frequently triggering landslides there. This study explores the role of these synoptic-scale circulations - extratropical western disturbances (WDs) and tropical depressions (TDs) - in producing the conducive conditions necessary to trigger landslides, using data from the NASA Global Landslide Catalog and WD and TD track databases. During the winter (October to April), UIB landslides peak in February and occur at a rate of 0.05 day(-1), 61% of which are associated with the passage of a WD. They are most common when aWD is located within a few hundred kilometres of 30 degrees N, and significantly rarer if the WD is north of 40 degrees N. WDs provide moist southwesterly flow from the Arabian Sea and Mediterranean Sea to the UIB, resulting in large-scale precipitation, but landslide probability is not related to WD intensity. Non-WD winter landslides are associated with small-scale orographic precipitation that we hypothesise is due to cloudbursts. During the summer (May to September), UIB landslides peak in August and occur at a rate of 0.11 day(-1), 60% of which are associated with TD activity. Many of these TDs are found over central India, slightly south of the climatological monsoon trough, where they provide strong monsoonal southeasterlies to the UIB flowing along the Himalayas. Increased landslide frequency is also associated with TD activity over the southern Bay of Bengal (BoB), and it is hypothesised that this is related to monsoon break conditions. Landslide frequency is significantly correlated with TD intensity. Non-TD landslides are associated with a northwestward extension of the monsoon trough, providing southeasterly barrier flow to the UIB. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Hunt, Kieran M.

High penetration of solar UV radiation in clear shallow lake affects the distribution and abundance of the zooplankton communities. Survival of copepods in such habitats often relies on available photoprotective compounds. We estimated species diversity and distribution patterns of copepods with detectable carotenoids in 7 lakes of the central Himalayas along the altitudinal gradients. To determine the factors influencing the accumulation of high-level photoprotective compounds, we analyzed the physicochemical parameters of water and the concentration of Lignin like Compounds (LLCs), Aromaticity (ARO), Humic Compounds (HCs), Degree of Humification (DoH) and percent Total Organic Matter (TOM) in littoral sediments. In the shallow lakes, copepod abundance and diversity correlate with water transparency. Humic compounds (HCs) derived from ligninaceous plants stimulate the accumulation of photoprotective compounds that allow for the domination of diaptomidae. Copepods receive photoprotective compounds from the humic-bounded sediment substrate. The amount of photoprotectants in the aquatic food chain of the central Himalayas is largely influenced by ligninaceous compounds derived from catchment vegetation. In copepods of shallow clear lakes, the remnant of dead trees in the littoral zones helps to minimize hazards caused by exposure effect and climatic stress. The reduction of vegetative covers in the shorelines may alter the community structure of zooplankton, particularly in the upland ecosystem. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, most susceptibility evaluation models assume that the weight of each influencing factor is equal, which is inconsistent with the actual situation. Therefore, this paper studies the optimization effect of weight calculation method on the information value model. Engineering disturbance disasters are developing in the Himalayan alpine valley in southeastern Tibet. First of all, this paper takes this as the research object and builds a database of engineering disturbance disasters in southeast Tibet through long-term on-site investigation. Then, the relationship between the influencing factors such as slope, aspect, relief, elevation, engineering geological rock formation, rainfall, temperature, and seismic peak acceleration and the distribution of engineering disturbance disasters is analyzed. Finally, the principal component analysis method and logistic regression method are employed to calculate the weight coefficients. Moreover, the susceptibility of engineering disturbance disasters is predicted using the information value model (IV-Only), as well as two weighted information value models (PCA-IV and LR-IV). In addition, the accuracy of these three susceptibility evaluation models is assessed based on two evaluation indexes. The results show that: compared with the equal weight method and the principal component analysis method, the logistic regression method has the highest accuracy. According to the weight coefficient, the control factors of engineering disturbance disasters in the Himalayan alpine canyon area are determined to be slope, aspect, rainfall, and elevation.

Additionally, a review of the existing policies and programs on pastoralism was carried out. Results demonstrate several reasons behind the decline of transhumance pastoralism: Policy focus on the establishment of conservation areas, increasing vulnerability to extreme events (avalanches, snowfall, storms, and disappearing water sources), and ineffective government policies and programs. Hardships involved in herding combined with changing social values and the degradation of pasture quality were identified as contributing factors to the growing challenges facing mountain pastoralism. Similarly, the declining interest among herders to continue their profession can be traced to vulnerability associated with escalating climate change impacts. Considerable knowledge gaps regarding threats to high-altitude pastoralism remain, and continued research on pastureland conservation, capacity development, facilitation for climate change adaptation, and coping strategies for herders in the high mountains is urgently needed.

Multiple approaches are employed for LSM in various physiographic regions; however, their applicability has differed across studies, with limited understanding on the most suitable approach for LSM in high mountain areas. Hence, we conducted LSM in the Indrawati watershed, a high mountain area of Central Nepal, employing four approaches: frequency ratio, logistic regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine. Nine landslide causal factors (slope, aspect, elevation, geological formation, proximity to river, proximity to road, land cover, soil type, and curvature) were considered for LSM. Rainfall-induced landslides were mapped by the on-screen digitization of satellite images and field observations. The landslides were randomly split into a ratio of 80:20 for training and validating the susceptibility maps. The LSMs obtained by four methods were then validated and compared using area under curve (AUC), kappa index, and statistical inferences (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy). Our study showed that Eutric Cambisols, a class of soil type, has a strong association with landslide occurrence among the 52 classes of the nine causal factors. We found that the artificial neural network approach possessed the best prediction capability (AUC value=86.9%) among the four methods, followed by logistic regression (85.6%), support vector machine (81.2%), and frequency ratio (80.1%) approaches. However, Kappa index and other statistical inferences suggested the support vector machine approach to be the second-best method. Overall, we found that the artificial neural network yields more accurate and reliable results and hence considered as a promising approach for susceptibility mapping in high mountainous region of Hindu-Kush Himalaya.

J,"Rohrer, M; Salzmann, N; Stoffel, M; Kulkarni, AV",,,,"Rohrer, Mario; Salzmann, Nadine; Stoffel, Markus; Kulkarni, Anil V.",,,Missing (in-situ) snow cover data hampers climate change and runoff studies in the Greater Himalayas,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"The Himalayas are presently holding the largest ice masses outside the polar regions and thus (temporarily) store important freshwater resources. In contrast to the contemplation of glaciers, the role of runoff from snow cover has received comparably little attention in the past, although (i) its contribution is thought to be at least equally or even more important than that of ice melt in many Himalayan catchments and (ii) climate change is expected to have widespread and significant consequences on snowmelt runoff. Here, we show that change assessment of snowmelt runoff and its timing is not as straightforward as often postulated, mainly as larger partial pressure of H2O, CO2, CH4, and other greenhouse gases might increase net long-wave input for snowmelt quite significantly in a future atmosphere. In addition, changes in the short-wave energy balance such as the pollution of the snow cover through black carbon or the sensible or latent heat contribution to snowmelt are likely to alter future snowmelt and runoff characteristics as well. For the assessment of snow cover extent and depletion, but also for its monitoring over the extremely large areas of the Himalayas, remote sensing has been used in the past and is likely to become even more important in the future. However, for the calibration and validation of remotely-sensed data, and even-more so in light of possible changes in snow-cover energy balance, we strongly call for more in-situ measurements across the Himalayas, in particular for daily data on new snow and snow cover water equivalent, or the respective energy balance components. Moreover, data should be made accessible to the scientific community, so that the latter can more accurately estimate climate change impacts on Himalayan snow cover and possible consequences thereof on runoff.

The Ganga River system in India is a large, complex system consisting of several long tributaries, some >1,000km, originating from 2 distinct hinterlandsthe Himalaya to the north and the cratons to the south. Traversing through a diverse climatic regime across the Plain and through precipitation zones ranging from 600mm/year near Delhi to 1,200mm/year in the eastern plains, the Ganga River system has formed very diverse landform assemblages in 3 major geomorphic domains. We have recognized 10 different river classes for the trunk river from Gangotri (source) to Farakka (upstream of its confluence with the Brahmaputra) based on (a) landscape setting, (b) channel and active floodplain properties, and (c) channel planform parameters. The mountainous stretch is characterized by steep valleys and bedrock channels and is dominated by large-scale sediment production and transport through hill slope processes. The alluvial part of the river is characterized by 8 different river classes of varying reach lengths (60-300km) many of which show sharp transitions in landscape setting. We have highlighted the application of this approach for the assessment of habitat suitability, environmental flows, and flood risk all of which have been significantly modified during the last few decades due to large-scale anthropogenic disturbances. We suggest that the diversity embedded in this geomorphic framework can be useful for developing a sustainable river management programme to work with the contemporary character and behaviour of rivers.","[Sinha, R.; Mohanta, H.; Tandon, S.

However, the rapid expansion of human activities (HA) poses a significant threat to the provision of the forest ecosystem services (FES). For simple and definitive assessments of FES and HA, the use of indicators has become an indispensable approach. In the present study, we performed: (i) indicator-based mapping of FES and HA, and (ii) evaluated the impact of HA on FES with the aid of geospatial techniques. Village-level analysis was conducted for FES and HA in the Aglar watershed of Uttarakhand, India for 2015. Four dominant forest types in the watershed-Quercus mixed, Pinus roxburghii, Cedrus deodara, and mixed forest were considered. For spatial characterization of FES, indicators such as forest carbon stock, net primary productivity, total water retention, and sediment yield were assessed, whereas human activity index (HAI) was evaluated using indicators of HAs, namely population density, road density, farmland, and habitation ratio. The integration of normalized values of FES indicators generated multiple ecosystem services indicator (MESI), and HAI was contructed using analytical hierarchical process based assignment of weights to HA indicators. Spatial analysis techniques such as ordinary least-square regression (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were used to derive the spatial relationship between them. The adjusted R-2 and AIC were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the model. The GWR model had a better fit with an adjusted R(2 )of 0.68 and a lower AIC of 42.940, compared to the OLS model with an adjusted R-2 of 0.21 and an AIC of 60.52. The statistics showed that GWR performed better than OLS and ably captured the heteroscedasticity of the phenomena. An inverse relation was observed between MESI and HAI. The findings of the study highlight the close link between the supply of FES and the impact of human-induced disturbances over the provision of FES, which has the potential to increase over time. The study provides a scientific basis for structuring policy dialogues to coordinate the long-term regional sustainability of FES provisioned from the Himalayan regions.","[Gupta, Stutee] Indian Space Res Org ISRO, Natl Remote Sensing Ctr, Hyderabad 500037, Telangana, India; [Gwal, Srishti; Singh, Sarnam] Indian Space Res Org ISRO, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India",,"Gwal, S (corresponding author), Indian Space Res Org ISRO, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India.",srishtigwal01@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2023,195.0,11,,,,,,,1335,10.1007/s10661-023-11902-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11902-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001095805100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Considering that the coverage of continuous GNSS sites in the Tibetan Plateau is sparse, a newly designed method that mainly contains Spatial Structure Function (SSF) construction and Median Spatial Filtering (MSF) is adopted to conduct GNSS imaging of point-wise velocities, which can well reveal the spatial pattern of vertical crustal motions. The result illustrates that the Himalayan belt bordering Nepal appears significant uplift at the rates of ~3.5 mm/yr, while the low-altitude regions of Nepal and Bhutan near the Tibetan Plateau are undergoing subsidence. The result suggests that the subduction of the Indian plate is the driving force of the uplift and subsidence in the Himalayan belt and its adjacent regions. Similarly, the thrusting of the Tarim Basin is the main factor of the slight uplift and subsidence in the Tianshan Mountains and Tarim Basin, respectively. In addition, we estimate the strain rate changes over the Tibetan Plateau using high-resolution GNSS horizontal velocities.

Some of the key geogenic CO2 suppliers are the magmatic mantle and metamorphic degassing from active and quiescent volcanoes, fault zones, geothermal systems and CO2 rich groundwater. Indian Himalayan geothermal field hosts about 340 geothermal springs in natural as well as artesian condition that eject hot waters and volatiles with varied temperature and chemical composition. These sites provide an opportunity to analyse tectonically driven gas emissions and their impact on regional and global climate. Here we adopt a method for direct measurement of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC approximate to HCO3) concentration in the geothermal springs to estimate geogenic CO2 flux from an active region based on water discharge and area of geothermal system between the tectonic boundaries of the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) of the Garhwal (Northwest) Himalaya. In the study area, geothermal spring water contain high delta C-13(DIC) ratio (- 8.5 parts per thousand to + 4.0 parts per thousand (VPDB)), and among the major ions, bicarbonate (HCO3-) varies by an order of magnitude from 1697 to 21,553 mu Eq/L; chloride and sodium vary from 90 to 19,171 mu Eq/L and 436 to 23181 mu Eq/L. The elevated concentration of Cl- and Na+ in geothermal spring waters suggests affinity towards their deeper origin. These geothermal springs cover a large area of nearly 10,000 km(2) of the Garhwal region showing a significant discharge of CO2 rich water with an estimated carbon dioxide degassing flux of similar to 7.2 x 10(6) mol/year to the atmosphere. Considering widespread occurrences of geothermal springs in tectonically active areas worldwide, the proposed direct measurement of DIC may be used as a reliable tool to estimate CO2 fluxes in different active orogenic settings within the Earth system. Results of stable isotopes of delta O-18 ((VSMOW)) and delta D ((VSMOW)) in these geothermal spring waters follow the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), suggesting affinity of their recharge through the meteoric origin.","[Tiwari, Sameer K.; Asthana, A.

In this study, we analyzed the climate variability and trends of change in precipitation and temperature for Kashmir Himalaya between 1980 and 2017. Investigations were carried out for six meteorological stations located within Kashmir valley. The non-parametric Mann?Kendall test was used for significance of trends in precipitation and temperature data on monthly, seasonal, and annual scales, while Sen?s non-parametric estimator of the slope was used to estimate the magnitude of trend. The results obtained indicate that the Kashmir region receives about 72% annual precipitation from Western Disturbances (WD) and 28% from Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM). The influence of ISM was higher towards south Kashmir, while north Kashmir was mostly influenced by western disturbances. The contribution of ISM to total rainfall recorded a 10% increase for the time series. With noticeable inter-station variations, our results indicate statistically significant positive trends for both TMax (p < 0.05) and TMin (p < 0.01) across Kashmir valley. The station-wise deviation of observed temperature with the lapse-rate projected temperatures for 5 stations also showed deviation. On an annual scale, the TMax and TMin for the region have increased by 0.035 ?C and 0.022 ?C, indicating that increase is more in the case of TMax. Analysis of precipitation revealed a non-significant positive trend, with an annual increase of 0.4 mm a- 1. Insignificant increasing trends were also observed during autumn, winter, and spring. On contrary, non-significant decreasing trends in precipitation were observed during summer. The station-wise precipitation variations were more evident for Kokernag and Qazigund which recorded increasing precipitation (p < 0.01), while Srinagar, Kupwara, and Pahalgam did not show any significant trend, and Gulmarg recorded a decreasing trend for precipitation.

This study aims to assess the hydrochemical characteristics and evaluate the irrigation suitability of water in the GBRS by reviewing published literature of the major tributaries. The studied rivers were categorized into two groups namely Group-1 and Group-2 considering the similarities of climatic patterns, hydrochemical attributes, and drainage characteristics. The hydrochemistry of the river water was characterized by the Piper diagram, Gibbs plot, mixing plots, and ionic ratios. Furthermore, irrigation water qualities were evaluated by electrical conductivity (EC), sodium percentage (Na%), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), magnesium hazard (MH), and Wilcox diagram. The results indicated that the hydrochemistry of the GBRS was slightly alkaline to alkaline (7.42-8.78) in nature. The average concentrations of most of the chemical attributes showed higher in Group-1, whereas the average concentrations of K+ and NO3- were found higher in Group-2. The average concentration of the major ions followed the dominancy order Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ for cations and HCO3- >SO42- > Cl- > NO3- for anions in both groups. Gibbs plot and mixing plot indicated that carbonate rock weathering dominates the hydrochemical process, which was further confirmed by the Piper diagram and the ionic ratios. From the analyses of irrigational water quality, almost all the rivers (except Gomti River in terms of MH and Rangit River in terms of Na%) in the GBRS were found to be suitable based on EC, SAR, Na%, MH, and Wilcox diagram. Finally, the majority of river systems in the GBRS were characterized by carbonate dominated lithology and irrigational water quality is mostly suitable for utilization.

The geomorphic, morphometric and lithostratigraphic studies of these cap deposits have been carried out to elucidate the effect of tectonics on the geomorphic evolution of Romushi Watershed. Geomorphic mapping was carried out using GPS measurements, DEM at 30m resolution, Topographic Position Index (TPI) model, topographic maps, LANDSAT TM Imagery and field data. Morphometric and morphotectonic analyses in GIS environment were used to calculate various geomorphic indices (Mountain Front Sinuosity Index, Bifurcation Ratio, Asymmetry Factor, River Profile, etc). These indices reveal that the tectonic uplift observed in the region due to Himalayan orogeny coupled with mass movement and aeolian deposition have dominated the landscape evolution of intermontane Karewa Basin of Kashmir throughout the Late Quaternary Period. Additional data from lithostratigraphic measurements were analyzed to understand the geomorphic evolution of intermontane Karewa Basin.

The source region of debris flow falls within the lower boundary of permafrost occurrence zone and lies below the 0 degrees C isotherm during late spring and summer months. In Shishkat catchment the 0 degrees C isotherm reaches above the debris flow source area during August and the glacier do not show any significant variations in velocity and surface elevation change. The debris flow source area is adjacent to the slow-moving rock glacier in Shishkat catchment while in Badswat catchment the debris flow initiated from the former glacier moraine. Both catchments are largely glacierized and thus sensitive to changes in climatic conditions and changes in the cryosphere response possess significant threats to the population downstream. Continuous monitoring of cryosphere-climate change in the region can contribute toward the improvement of disaster risk reduction and mitigation policies.","[Hassan, Wajid; Su, Feng-huan; Liu, Wei-ming; Bazai, Nazir Ahmed; Yang, Ze-wen; Ali, Muzaffar] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Hassan, Wajid; Su, Feng-huan; Liu, Wei-ming; Bazai, Nazir Ahmed] CAS HEC, China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan; [Hassan, Wajid; Yang, Ze-wen; Ali, Muzaffar] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hassan, Javed] Tech Univ Denmark, DTU Space, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark; [Hassan, Muzammil] Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Gilgit Baltistan 15100, Pakistan; [Wang, Hao] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Mt Hazards & Earth Surface Proc, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Castellanos, Daniel Garcia] ICTJA CSIC, Inst Ciencias Tierra Jaume Almera, Sole I Sabaris S-N, Barcelona 08028, Spain",,"Su, FH; Liu, WM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China.;Su, FH; Liu, WM (corresponding author), CAS HEC, China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan.",wajidhassan16@gmail.com; fhsu@imde.ac.cn; liuwm@imde.ac.cn; javed@space.dtu.dk; muzummil.hassan1@gmail.com; nazirbazai61@yahoo.com; hgoodspeed2008@163.com; yangzewen21@mails.ucas.ac.cn; alimuzaffar645@gmail.com; danielgc@ictja.csic.es,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2023,20.0,12,,,,,3687,3702,,10.1007/s11629-023-7894-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-023-7894-5,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001135359800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the other hand, its productivity is adversely affected by climatic changes mainly due to the absence or non-adoption of effective and modern mitigation and adaptation strategies. The geographical locations and socio-economic conditions of developing countries make livestock herders, especially the smaller ones, more vulnerable while their capabilities to mitigate the adverse effects with limited resources will exacerbate the situation in the future. Most of the efforts to face climatic changes are directed at crop sector while only a few studies document such actions to safeguard livestock sector with similar focus notwithstanding the huge impact of these stimuli on this sub-sector of agriculture. This study uses propensity score matching (PSM) to assess the causal impact of climate change adaptation strategies on livestock losses and poverty by using the primary data set of 405 small livestock herders of Punjab, Pakistan. The PSM analysis points towards a massive potential for reducing these losses. The livestock losses and poverty index are shown to decline respectively by 30-48% and 4-22% for the farmers adopting a mix of mitigation strategies. Such outcome is believed to sustain environment and livestock herders' well-being. Results indicate that livestock herders easily adopt those strategies that have greater linkages with accessibility and resource availability. Study reveals the significance of improving infrastructure for speedy access to information, resources and uninterrupted flow of veterinary services. The vet personnel also need to be equipped with precise statistics of disease existence, impacts, dispersal, and costs for control by restructuring and advancing data collection efforts that would entail coherent policy formulation amidst evidence-based outcomes. The results do imply allocation of huge investment in the information delivery system; competitive institutional services and particular safeguarding of the resource-poor farmers to sustain livelihoods, food security and rural development.","[Faisal, Muhammad; Xia, Chunping] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Abbas, Azhar] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Agr & Resource Econ, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan; [Akhtar, Shoaib] Barani Agr Res Inst BARI, Ctr Excellence Olive Res & Training CEFORT, Chakwal, Pakistan; [Ajmal, Muhammad Arslan] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Econ, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Mushtaq, Zulqarnain] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Cai, Yi] South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Digital Countryside Res Inst, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Raza, Muhammad Haseeb] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Inst Business Management Sci, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan",,"Xia, CP (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Cai, Y (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Digital Countryside Res Inst, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.",faisalgurmani@gmail.com; Azhar.Abbas@uaf.edu.pk; xcp@mail.hzau.edu.cn; haseebrizvi00@yahoo.com; shoaibakhtar1799@gmail.com; arslan.gogo7@gmail.com; Zulqarnain@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; caiyi@scau.edu.cn,,,,,,,,16.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,34.0,,,,,,,,100358,10.1016/j.crm.2021.100358,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2021.100358,,SEP 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000704981500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

With an increase in agricultural expansion and infrastructural development, every land surface on earth calls for a long-term investigation of land modification patterns and their underlying contributory factors. The present investigation monitors the LULC changes and assesses the process controls in Kohima and Dimapur districts of Nagaland, India. Currently, these two districts encompassing the main urban cities of the hilly state are experiencing rapid urbanization and unplanned developmental activities. Alike any other LULC changes observed in unplanned and developing cities, these districts are likely to face environmental degradation, and particularly, the occurrence of frequent landslides and flash floods. The study has three objectives-(i) LULC mapping of Kohima and Dimapur districts for three periods (1998, 2008, and 2018), (ii) comparative analysis of LULC change patterns in the two districts during the three epochs (1998-2008, 2008-2018, and 1998-2018), and (iii) assessment of the contributory factors. For the study, remotely sensed LANDSAT images (TM and OLI) in Geographical Information System (GIS) platform were utilized along with field surveys. Supervised classification technique was employed and four major LULC classes were identified using Landsat level-1 classification system. The overall accuracy of the classification varied between 91 and 98%. Results showed that Built Up areas have increased significantly in both the districts at the rate of 322.6 ha/year in Kohima and 301.9 ha/year in Dimapur during 1998-2018. On the other hand, Agricultural Land and Forest Land declined in both districts. Changes in LULC were mainly due to marginalization of shifting cultivation, deforestation, infrastructural development, urban migration, and flourishing of aquaculture farming. This study furnishes baseline information on LULC in the data-scarce region of Northeast India and is an insinuation to the policy-makers to ensure sustainable land use planning in the face of rapid urbanization.","[Ritse, Vimha; Kulnu, Amenuo Susan; Hazarika, Nabajit] Nagaland Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Zunheboto 798627, Nagaland, India; [Basumatary, Himolin] Tezpur Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Sonitpur 784028, Assam, India; [Dutta, Gitamani] Bot Balipara Tract & Frontier Fdn, Sonitpur 784102, Assam, India; [Phukan, Mayur Mausoom] Nagaland Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Forest Sci, Zunheboto 798627, Nagaland, India",,"Hazarika, N (corresponding author), Nagaland Univ, Sch Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Zunheboto 798627, Nagaland, India.",nabajit4u@gmail.com,,,,,,,,19.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 17,2020,192.0,11,,,,,,,711,10.1007/s10661-020-08674-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08674-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000582466000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we measured nitrogen (delta N-15-NO3-) and oxygen (delta O-18-NO3- and Delta O-17-NO3-) isotope compositions in nitrate aerosols at the Qomolangma station (QOMS) over the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau (HTP) to quantify the formation mechanisms and emission sources of nitrate at the background site. At QOMS, the enhanced NO3- concentrations were observed in the springtime. The average delta N-15-NO3-, delta O-18-NO3-, and Delta O-17-NO3- values were 0.4 +/- 4.9, 64.7 +/- 11.5 and 27.6 +/- 6.9 parts per thousand, respectively. Seasonal variations of isotope ratios at QOMS can be explained by the different emissions and formation pathways to nitrate. The average fractions of NO2 + OH and N2O5 + H2O to nitrate production were estimated to be 43 and 52%, respectively, when the NO3 + hydrocarbon (HC)/dimethyl sulfide (DMS) (NO3 + HC/DMS) pathway was assumed to be 5%. Using stable isotope analysis in the R (SIAR) model, the relative contributions of biomass burning (BB), biogenic soil emission, traffic, and coal combustion to nitrate were estimated to be 28, 25, 24, and 23%, respectively, on yearly basis. By FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) dispersion model, we highlighted that NOx from BB emission over South Asia that had undergone N2O5 + H2O processes enhanced the nitrate concentrations in the springtime over the HTP region.","[Lin, Yu-Chi; Zhang, Yan-Lin; Yu, Mingyuan; Fan, Mei-Yi; Xie, Feng; Zhang, Wen-Qi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Int Joint Lab Climate & Environm Change, Yale NUIST Ctr Atmospher Environm, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Lin, Yu-Chi; Zhang, Yan-Lin; Yu, Mingyuan; Fan, Mei-Yi; Xie, Feng; Zhang, Wen-Qi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Lin, Yu-Chi; Zhang, Yan-Lin; Yu, Mingyuan; Fan, Mei-Yi; Xie, Feng; Zhang, Wen-Qi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Lin, Yu-Chi; Zhang, Yan-Lin; Yu, Mingyuan; Fan, Mei-Yi; Xie, Feng; Zhang, Wen-Qi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Appl Meteorol, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Agr Meteorol, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wu, Guangming; Cong, Zhiyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Michalski, Greg] Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Atmospher & Planetary Sci, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Michalski, Greg] Purdue Univ, Dept Chem, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,"Zhang, YL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Int Joint Lab Climate & Environm Change, Yale NUIST Ctr Atmospher Environm, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YL (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Appl Meteorol, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Agr Meteorol, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",dryanlinzhang@outlook.com,,,,,,,,17.0,18.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 21,2021,55.0,18,,,,,12261,12271,,10.1021/acs.est.1c03957,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.1c03957,,SEP 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000699957900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Index of Relative Active Tectonic (IRAT) value for Gandak and Mahananda was determined to be 1, indicating that the basins are extremely active, whereas Burhi Gandak, Bagmati, and Kosi were moderately active with a 2 IRAT value. The Kamla basin is the least active with an IRAT value of 4. The Liquefaction Susceptibility Map (LSM) was divided into three categories: liquefaction not likely (24%), liquefaction possible (45%), and liquefaction likely (31%); the estimated RMSE values were 0.0084, 0.00048, and 0.00031, respectively. The integrated analysis, which employs both techniques, demonstrates how the individual basins will be affected by liquefaction during an earthquake.

Morphometric indices are converted into the unitless 8-bit data format (0-255), and priority weights are assigned to the specified range of control points in fuzzy AHP while consecutive ranks are assigned to indices based on their association with erosion process to get the CF values for each of watershed. The results of prioritisation through both approaches show a quite alike output that is both identifies sub-watershed 6 and 13 as very high erosion prone and CF classifies sub-watershed 4 and 8 as high erosion prone while fuzzy AHP recognises sub-watershed 4, 8, 5, 11, 14 under high-risk category.

Alternate land use plans were developed for optimizing four objective functions - maximizing farm income, employment and nutritional security, and minimizing soil loss individually and simultaneously at the watershed level. The analysis was carried under two capital availability scenarios (restricied and unrestricted). The values of cultivated land utilization index (CLUI), crop diversification index (CDI), cropping intensity (CI) and forest dependency were estimated for each plan. Inferior plans were eliminated by applying the Law of Dominance rule. Out of the several optimal plans generated, the best land use plan was selected by employing MODSS techniques. Annual fodder production, sustainable animal population and changes in forest dependency were then computed. Optimal plans suggested significant changes in the number of buffaloes and cows in the watershed and in land use. Under a restricted capital availability scenario, forest dependency would change from existing surplus fodder availability to a dependency of 31.96% under the optimal plan, while under unrestricted capital scenario, forest dependency would be about 29.6%. This technique for land use planning to balance farmer and environmental needs has potential to prepare plans that will reduce current trends of increased forest degradation in the Himalayas. Watershed development and forest management plans in the central middle Himalayan region would therefore need to incorporate several measures to improve forest productivity, in situ moisture conservation and develop effective participatory forest management plans. The complexity of sustainable watershed development in a highly heterogeneous landscape requires that such optimal land use plans be developed for various identified micro-watersheds to meet location specific social and environmental requirements in the Himalayan region.

Field measurements on Hinarche Glacier in Bagrot Valley are combined with remote sensing information and climate observations to investigate the meltwater production of the glacier and estimate the meltwater discharge in the valley. Special emphasis was placed on ice melt beneath supraglacial debris, which is the common process on the glacier tongues in the region. The calculated annual meltwater production of about 135 million m(3) for Hinarche Glacier shows the order of magnitude for glacier runoff in such environments. Glacial meltwater production is about 300 million m(3) per year for the entire valley under balanced conditions.

We performed a hybrid analytical approach i.e. integrated statistical and theoretical tools to detect the warming trend and its ecological and societal implications across the country. The Eastern part of the country was found to be more warming than the Central and Western parts, showing an increased climatic sensitivity across the Khumbu (Mt. Everest region). The increasing trends of temperature have been found in all physiographic regions along an altitude gradient, i.e. Terai, Siwaliks, Lower Hills, and Upper Hills observed 0.15, 0.26, 0.68, and 0.57 degrees C per decade, respectively. Higher warming trend in Lower Hills than the Upper Hills showed that higher elevations experienced lesser degrees of warming trends than the lower elevations in the mountainous regions. Further, a higher warming trend was observed in the winter season than the other seasons in all regions except for Terai. Based on the warming trends in different physiographic regions, we also found a similar pattern of ecological impacts, where a higher warming region also experienced higher ecological impacts such as changes in water resources, phenology, etc. Lower Hills, Upper Hills, and Mountains experienced higher adverse impacts than the Terai and Siwaliks in the current global warming scenarios.","[Dhital, Yam Prasad] Shihezi Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Shihezi 832000, Peoples R China; [Dhital, Yam Prasad; Tang, Jianwu] East China Normal Univ, Inst Ecochongming, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Dhital, Yam Prasad; Jia, Shaofeng; Liu, Xingcai; Zhang, Xuejun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Dhital, Yam Prasad] Inst Fundamental Res & Studies, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Pant, Ramesh Raj] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Environm Sci, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Dawadi, Binod] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Hydrol & Meteorol, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Dawadi, Binod] Tribhuvan Univ, Chinese Acad Sci, Kathmandu Ctr Res & Educ, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Dhital, YP (corresponding author), Shihezi Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Shihezi 832000, Peoples R China.;Dhital, YP (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Inst Ecochongming, State Key Lab Estuarine & Coastal Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Dhital, YP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Dhital, YP (corresponding author), Inst Fundamental Res & Studies, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal.",ypdhital@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 1,2023,5.0,3,,,,,,,31010,10.1088/2515-7620/acc56e,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/acc56e,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000963938500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An average TSP concentration of 69.6 +/- 51.8 mu g m(-3) was found, exhibiting a pre-monsoon (March-May) maximum (92.9 +/- 48.5 mu g m(-3)) due to dust transport and forest fires and a monsoon (June-August) minimum due to atmospheric washout, while carbonaceous aerosols and inorganic species expressed a similar seasonality. The mean OC/EC ratio (8.0 +/- 3.3) and the good correlations between OC, EC, and nss-K+ suggested that biomass burning (BB) was one of the major contributing factors to aerosols in Nainital. Using the EC tracer method, along with several approaches for the determination of the (OC/EC)pri ratio, the estimated SOC component accounted for similar to 25% (19.3-29.7%). Furthermore, TSP source apportionment via PMF allowed for a better understanding of the aerosol sources in the Central Himalayan region. The key aerosol sources over Nainital were BB (27%), secondary sulfate (20%), secondary nitrate (9%), mineral dust (34%), and long-range transported mixed marine aerosol (10%). The potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analyses were also used to identify the probable regional source areas of resolved aerosol sources. The main source regions for aerosols in Nainital were the plains in northwest India and Pakistan, polluted cities like Delhi, the Thar Desert, and the Arabian Sea area. The outcomes of the present study are expected to elucidate the atmospheric chemistry, emission source origins, and transport pathways of aerosols over the central Himalayan region.","[Sheoran, Rahul; Dumka, Umesh Chandra] Aryabhatta Res Inst Observat Sci, Naini Tal 263001, India; [Kaskaoutis, Dimitris G.; Grivas, Georgios; Mihalopoulos, Nikos] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Athens 15236, Greece; [Kaskaoutis, Dimitris G.; Mihalopoulos, Nikos] Univ Crete, Dept Chem, Environm Chem Proc Lab, Iraklion 71003, Greece; [Ram, Kirpa] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Prakash, Jai] Washington Univ, Aerosol & Air Qual Res Lab, Dept Energy Environm & Chem Engn, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Hooda, Rakesh K.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Erik Palmenin Aukio 1, FI-00560 Helsinki, Finland; [Tiwari, Rakesh K.] DDU Gorakhpur Univ, Dept Phys, Gorakhpur 273009, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mihalopoulos, Nikos] Cyprus Inst, Climate & Atmosphere Res Ctr, CY-2121 Nicosia, Cyprus",,"Dumka, UC (corresponding author), Aryabhatta Res Inst Observat Sci, Naini Tal 263001, India.",rahul.sheoran@aries.res.in; dumka@aries.res.in; dkask@noa.gr; ggrivas@noa.gr; ram.iesd@bhu.ac.in; jaipism@gmail.com; rakesh.hooda@fmi.fi; rakesh.phy@ddugu.ac.in; nmihalo@noa.gr,,,,,,,,14.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2021,12.0,9,,,,,,,1228,10.3390/atmos12091228,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12091228,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000699053900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Knowingly, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is considered the principal altitudinal permafrost constituent on earth and is deemed as the third 'pole'. Among which, the Zoige wetlands are located in the northeastern boundary of QTP, wrapping a total area of 6180 km(2) with an average altitude of 3500 m. This entire region is the hotspot for methane emission since the last decade. Given the importance of methane emission, many studies have focused on the effect of environmental fluctuations on the overall methane profile and, more recently on the methanogenic community structure. The current review summarizes recent advancements of the methanogenic community and methane profile and outlines a framework for better understanding of the microbial ecology of the Zoige wetlands, China. Moreover, as microorganisms are indispensable to biogeochemical cycles, especially for methane, they are believed to be the best indicators to identify the condition of wetlands. Hence, we suggest that, underpinning the microbial profile could help understand the status of a wetland. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Cross-taxon congruence in biodiversity (alpha-diversity and beta-diversity) across macrolichens, mosses, liverworts, woody plants (shrubs and trees) and ants was investigated, so as to examine the extent to which these group, of organisms can function as Surrogates for each other. Although woody plants provided a major substrate for macrolichens and mosses, there was no species-specific association between them. Woody plant species richness was highly positively correlated with mosses (r(2) = 0.63, P < 0.001) but the relationship, as not particularly very strong with lichens and liverworts. While there was a significant correlation in the species turnover (beta-diversity) of macrolichens with mosses (r(2) = 0.21 P < 0.005). the relationship was relatively poor with the woody plants. On the other hand. negative correlations emerged in the species richness of ants with those of macrolichens, mosses and woody plants (r(2) = -0.44 P < 0.05). but most of the complementarity (turnover) relationships among them were positive, Since diversity between taxonomic hierarchies within the group was consistently significantly positively correlated in all these taxa, the higher taxonomic categories Such as genus and family may be employed as surrogates for rapid assessment and monitoring of species diversity, Although no single group other than macrolichens has emerged as a good indicator of changes in species richness in all other groups, some concordant relationships between them conform to the hypothesis that species assemblages of certain taxonomic groups could still be used as surrogates for efficient monitoring of species diversity in other groups whose distribution may further predict the importance of conserving overall biodiversity in landscapes such as the Garhwal Himalaya.

Three sub-regions of fold-and-thrust belt are the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range, Kohat Plateau-Surghar Range and the Bannu Basin-Khisor Range. The difference in deformation intensity between these regions is mainly attributed to the presence, or absence, of an Infra-Cambrian salt layer. This study investigates the active tectonics of the Potwar Plateau and Salt Range region, emphasizing the role of salt, using the Small Baseline Subset Interferometry (SBAS) technique and 2-D seismic interpretations. Ten PALSAR images and four seismic profiles from western Potwar Plateau-Salt Range region were used. SBAS results, derived from PALSAR images spanning from 2007 to 2010, suggest that the Potwar Plateau-Salt Range is active with the western portion of the region experiencing an uplift at an average rate of around 10 mm/year. Two uplift anomalies were observed, which were interpreted as zones of transpression and salt diapirism. Time-migrated seismic profiles show that the salt layer acts as a detachment. Our results show that salt has different roles in different regions of the fold-and-thrust belt; in the Potwar Plateau region the salt layer acts as a detachment, while in Salt Range salt flow-induced structures are prominent. The integration of SBAS and 2D seismic interpretation reveals that the deformation of western Potwar Plateau-Salt Range is influenced by two main faults, the dextral Kalabagh fault and the Main Frontal Thrust. Finally, this work was compared to the Kuqa fold-and-thrust belt in western China due to their structural similarities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Through a combination of geostatistical analysis, geophysical inversion and visualization techniques, it is possible to re-model and visualize the single dimension resistivity data into 2D and 3D space. The variogram models are utilized to extend the interpretation of the data and to distinguish individual lithologic units and the occurrence of saline water within the subsurface. The resistivity data has been calibrated with the lithological logs taken from the available boreholes. As such the alluvial system of the Domail Plain has formed during episodes of local tectonic activity with fluvial erosion and deposition yielding coarse sediments with high electrical resistivities near to the mountain ranges and finer sediments with medium to low electrical resistivities which tend to settle in the basin center. Thus a change is depositional setting happened from basin lacustrine environment to flash flooding during the Himalayan orogeny. The occurrence of rock salt in the northern mountains has imparted a great influence on the groundwater quality of the study area. The salt is dissolved by water which infiltrates into the subsurface through the water channels.

A conservation agriculture field experiment was established at a 6% field slope in 2011 at the ICAR-IISWC Research Farm, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, which is situated in the Northwestern Himalayan Region, India. The objective of this study was to experimentally determine the long-term effects of tillage practices on runoff and soil erosion. The tillage practices opted for were conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT), and zero tillage (ZT). Event-based runoff and soil loss were monitored during three monsoon seasons (June to September) from 2018 to 2020. Results showed lower runoff and soil loss in the ZT plot than in CT and MT plots. CT produced 1.51 and 2.53 times higher runoff than MT and ZT, respectively. Moreover, this increased runoff generated 1.84 and 5.10 times higher soil erosion in CT than in MT and ZT, respectively. The extreme rainfall events being less than 10% generated 54.93%, 57.35%, and 63.43% of the total runoff volume which resulted in 82.08%, 85.49%, and 91.00% of the total soil loss in CT, MT, and ZT plots, respectively. For the same amount of rainfall, the reduction in soil loss was 39% and 68% in the CT and ZT plots, respectively, at the highest growth stage in comparison to the initial crop growth stage. The values of runoff reduction benefit (RRB) and sediment reduction benefit (SRB) showed a reduction in runoff (63.53%) and soil loss (80.39%) in the CT. Results concluded that conservation tillage reduced runoff and soil loss significantly even in extreme rainfall events.","[Singh, Deepak; Patra, Sridhar; Mariappan, Sankar; Yadav, Devideen; Ojasvi, Prabhat Ranjan; Kumar, Gopal; Madhu, Made Gowda; Chand, Lekh] Indian Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Dehra Dun 248195, India; [Mishra, Alok Kumar] Sam Higginbottom Univ Agr Technol & Sci, Comp Sci & Engn, Prayagraj 211007, India; [Dwivedi, Anuj Kumar; Ojha, Chandra Shekhar Prasad] Indian Inst Technol, Roorkee 247667, India; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Babu, Subhash; Sena, Dipak Ranjan] Indian Agr Res Inst, New Delhi 110012, India; [Singh, Nisha] Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal Univ, A Cent Univ, Dept Biochem, Srinagar 246174, India; [Kumar, Suresh] Indian Inst Remote Sensing Indian, Space Res Org ISRO, Dehra Dun 248195, India",,"Singh, D (corresponding author), Indian Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Dehra Dun 248195, India.;Dwivedi, AK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Roorkee 247667, India.",dpk905@gmail.com; akumar17@ce.iitr.ac.in,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 19,2023,15.0,10,,,,,,,8285,10.3390/su15108285,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15108285,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000997037300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Soil samples collected from the surface layer (0-15 cm) of 75 locations in the watershed, through grid sampling approach during the fallow period of November 2015, were preprocessed and analysed for various soil nutrients like soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Spectral indices like Colouration Index, Brightness Index, Hue Index and Redness Index derived from Landsat 8 satellite data and terrain parameters such as Terrain Wetness Index, Stream Power Index and slope using CartoDEM (30 m) were used. Spectral and terrain indices sensitive to different nutrients were identified using correlation analysis and thereafter used for predictive modelling of nutrients using ANN technique by employing feed-forward neural network with backpropagation network architecture and Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm. The prediction of SOC was obtained with an R-2 of 0.83 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.05, whereas for available nitrogen, it was achieved with an R-2 value of 0.62 and MSE of 0.0006. The prediction accuracy for phosphorus was low, since the phosphorus content in the area was far below the normal P values of typical Indian soils and thus the R-2 value observed was only 0.511.

In the present study, we used stable water isotope and remote sensing data to understand the impact of climate on melting behavior of some high-altitude glaciers in two glacier-fed basins of western Himalaya, India. Glacier samples were collected from four major glaciers of Liddar (Kashmir region) and Suru basins (Ladakh region) during melting season from May 2012 to November 2013 for delta O-18 and delta H-2. It was observed that the glacier samples from Suru basin were more depleted in O-18 and H-2 (-10.9 to -16.2 parts per thousand and -73 to -128 parts per thousand) than the glaciers of Liddar basin (-8.2 to -14.9 parts per thousand and -52 to -102 parts per thousand). However, the d-excess of the glacier samples in Suru basin was lower (13.5-21.6 parts per thousand) than the glaciers of Liddar basin (17-28 parts per thousand). It was observed that the temporal changes in weather pattern strongly influence the isotopic composition of the glaciers with progressive decrease and increase in delta O-18 (or delta H-2) with the increase in ambient temperature and rainfall, respectively. The results suggest that during the sunny days of August and September, the glaciers are melting at higher altitudes (3900-4172 m) in the accumulation zone, reflecting that the glaciers of Liddar basin are not the ideal sites for the ice coring for paleoclimatological studies.

Key information necessary is how different forest user groups perceive and prioritize different ecosystem services based on their local setting. We assessed the socio-cultural values of ecosystem services of high-altitude oak forests in Western Bhutan using participatory approaches with two important forest users: local communities and forest experts. We found that these forests serve as a pool of 22 ecosystem services under four MEA categories of provisioning (9), regulating (8), supporting (2), and cultural (3) services. Fresh water was unanimously identified as the most valuable service, as well as the most vulnerable, by both the groups. The priorities of local communities inclined towards provisioning and cultural services due to their dependence on these services for their livelihood and wellbeing. Forest experts' priorities were more evenly spread over three categories of services: provisioning, regulating, and supporting services, reflecting their broader interest in resource management, biodiversity conservation, and climate change mitigation. Several regulating and supporting services were not easily identified by many villagers, suggesting that bridging the priorities of local interests with broader national forestry goals may require public partnerships and integrated decision-making about the entire suite of ecosystem services. Several management interventions proposed by the groups were presented for consideration by local users, scientists, and policy makers. For all ongoing and future ecosystem service assessments, we recommend the integration of socio-cultural values with biophysical and monetary assessments to fully value the benefits from the high-altitude oak forests.","[Dorji, Tshewang; Brookes, Justin D.; Facelli, Jose M.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Dorji, Tshewang; Norbu, Tshewang; Dorji, Kuenzang; Chhetri, Yog Raj] Ugyen Wangchuck Inst Conservat & Environm Res, POB 2049, Thimphu, Bhutan; [Sears, Robin R.; Baral, Himlal] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Bogor 16115, Indonesia; [Sears, Robin R.] Harvard Forest, 324 N Main St, Petersham, MA 01366 USA",,"Dorji, T (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.;Dorji, T (corresponding author), Ugyen Wangchuck Inst Conservat & Environm Res, POB 2049, Thimphu, Bhutan.",tshewang.dorji@adelaide.edu.au; justin.brookes@adelaide.edu.au; jose.facelli@adelaide.edu.au; robin.sears@aya.yale.edu; tnorbu@uwice.gov.bt; kdorji@uwice.gov.bt; chhetriy@gmail.com; h.baral@cgiar.org,,,,,,,,30.0,31.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR 2,2019,11.0,8,,,,,,,2250,10.3390/su11082250,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11082250,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000467752200063,View Full Record in Web of Science

To assess the rainfall anomalies and the extent of farmers' dependency on rainwater for farming, a semi-structured questionnaire survey was conducted in six districts of the country, covering low-, mid- and high-altitude agro-ecosystems. A point score analysis showed that most farmers (50% or more) depended on rainwater for farming activities. The extent of farmers' dependency on rainfall across the districts was as high as 51%, except for Paro which had a lower dependency level of 10-20%. However, an overwhelming 40-80% of respondents had perception of decreased rain over the years, and the rainfall data for 20 years (1997-2017) showed a decreasing trend, reinforcing the survey findings. Moreover, up to 75% of respondents had perceptions of rain being untimely and unpredictable, including fewer incidences of short spells of high intensity or occasional prolonged periods of rains. The consequences of these issues were perceived to have caused (1) drying of water sources; (2) delay in planting; (3) erosion and infrastructure damage; and (4) work disruption. To overcome these issues, there is a need to overhaul Bhutan's irrigation system, in terms of both infrastructure development and methods as aspired by farmers. The need of the hour for Bhutan is to reduce dependency on rains with state-of-the-art irrigation technologies to buffer against the changing patterns of rain and to improve farmers' resilience to the impact of climate change.","[Chhogyel, Ngawang] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Chhogyel, Ngawang] Minist Agr & Forests, Dept Agr, Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Bajo, Wangdue Phodran, Bhutan; [Kumar, Lalit] Eastcoast Geospatial Consultants, Armidale, NSW 2350, Australia; [Bajgai, Yadunath] Minist Agr & Forests, Dept Agr, Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Natl Potato Program, Thimphu, Bhutan",,"Chhogyel, N (corresponding author), Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia.;Chhogyel, N (corresponding author), Minist Agr & Forests, Dept Agr, Agr Res & Dev Ctr, Bajo, Wangdue Phodran, Bhutan.",nchhogye@myune.edu.au,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2021,21.0,4,,,,,,,125,10.1007/s10113-021-01851-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-021-01851-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000723639700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Regression analysis using GWR model better explained the relationship between LER (dependent variable) and distance from different road-types (independent variables) as compared to OLS with a significant correlation at 1% confidence interval. The spatial variations in the interrelation between dependent and independent variables were explained using quantified coefficients estimated by the GWR model.

Currently, there is no comprehensive framework for assessing cooperation on protected areas (PAs) in the KH region. Such a framework is essential to guide managers and policymakers in the formulation of consistent management plans and strategies for regional sustainable development. In this study, an indicator framework for assessing cooperation on PAs was developed based on four factors: the natural environment, the human environment, transport accessibility, and the diplomatic environment. The assessment involved 49 cross-border national parks and nature reserves in this region. Furthermore, the indicators were analyzed by using the analytic hierarchy process, resulting in eight cross-border groups. The analysis reveals that the region has a good foundation for cooperative cross-border conservation in general. Among the eight groups, the Karakoram-Pamir, Kangchenjunga, and Everest groups exhibit greater potential for closer cooperation, whereas the Kashmir group has a lower basis for cooperation. The results suggest that the establishment of transboundary conservation areas (TBCAs) and academic and scientific development can provide opportunities to enhance our understanding of the KH region and to collaborate across national boundaries. This case study explains that the indicator framework can be used as a reference for cooperative cross-border conservation in other regions worldwide.","[Li, Jie; Gao, Jun; Li, Weiyue; Zhang, Zhonghao; Fu, Jing; Guo, Xin] Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Gao, Jun; Li, Weiyue; Zhang, Zhonghao; Fu, Jing] Shanghai Normal Univ, Inst Urban Studies, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Jie; Shao, Guofan] Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",,"Fu, J (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Sch Environm & Geog Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Shao, GF (corresponding author), Purdue Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",tristar@shnu.edu.cn; shao@purdue.edu,,,,,,,,6.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2021,126.0,,,,,,,,107658,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107658,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107658,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000647801300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In 2013, SES experienced an unusual rainfall event followed by cloud burst event at upper Himalayan regime. Average meio-benthic abundance declined considerably in the study area from early phase of monsoon (EM) (699 +/- 1569.4 ind. 10 cm(-2)) to later one (LM) (437 +/- 949.9 ind. 10 cm(-2)) probably due to high annual rainfall which completely flushed the estuary. Free-living marine nematodes were the dominant group among all other meiobenthic taxa in both phases of monsoon. Nematode community was made up of 49 genera in 22 families. Comesomatidae, Chromadoridae, Linhomoeidae and Xylidae were the richest and most abundant families. During both phases of monsoon, stations, which were represented by fine sediments and high amount of organic carbon, harbored higher meiofaunal densities and nematode diversity with a strong dominance of 1B and 213 trophic guilds of nematodes. Different feeding guilds of nematode would be able to reveal anthropogenic-induced stress, which could be useful in assessing ecological quality of estuarine ecosystems. The present study indicates that climate change mediated unusual monsoonal precipitation may notoriously affect the meiobenthic assemblages in tropical estuaries like SES. Thus, this study could be an important first stepping stone for monitoring the future environmental impact on meiobenthic community in the largest mangrove region of the world.","[Ghosh, Moumita; Mandal, Sumit] Presidency Univ, Marine Ecol Lab, Dept Life Sci, 86-1 Coll St, Kolkata 700073, India; [Chatterjee, Meenakshi] Basanti Devi Coll, Kolkata 700029, India",,"Mandal, S (corresponding author), Presidency Univ, Marine Ecol Lab, Dept Life Sci, 86-1 Coll St, Kolkata 700073, India.",sumit.dhs@presiuniv.ac.in,,,,,,,,10.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2018,94.0,,1,,,,139,150,,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.06.067,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.06.067,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000452692500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Comparisons were made with an undisturbed forest site in the same region. Concentrations of soil organic C, total N, total P and extractable nutrients (Ca, Mg and K) increased with the age of sites. The 58-year-old site showed concentrations of soil organic C, total N and total P that were 75-89% of concentrations in the undisturbed sal forest. The soil microbial biomass, the active fraction of soil organic matter, showed similar seasonal variations at all sites. The amount of mean microbial biomass (expressed as C, N and P contents) increased 4-5 times at the 58-year-old site relative to the I-year-old site, and the bulk increase occurred within the initial 15 year. The increase in the C/N ratio of soil microbial biomass with age (9.4-11.6 years) reflected change in its composition. Although the net N-mineralization rate increased consistently until 58 years of age, the proportion of nitrification rate relative to ammonification rate distinctly decreased beyond 40 years. On the other hand, the soil available-N (both NO3- and NH4+) concentrations increased from 1 to 40 year and then declined; with age the proportion of NH4+ increased, however. Rates of restoration in soil properties were faster in the early successional stages (1-15 year) than late stages. Among different soil properties the restoration of soil microbial biomass (C and N) was faster than soil organic C and total N. Best fit power function models showed that the estimated times for the 58-year-old site to reach the level of the undisturbed, mature sal forest would be about 30-35 year for microbial biomass (C and N)and about 100-150 year for organic C and total N. Higher accumulation of soil microbial biomass and high N-mineralization rate at late successional stages indicated the re-establishment of enriched soil and restitution of nutrient cycling during the course of ecosystem restoration.

The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown provides a rare opportunity to quantify the impact of restricted anthropogenic activities on the water chemistry resilience of large rivers. By analyzing the daily geochemical record of the Ganga River, we demonstrate that reduced industrial discharge during 51 days of mandated nationwide lockdown decreased the dissolved heavy metal concentrations by a minimum of 50%. In contrast, nitrate and phosphate inputs predominantly derived from agricultural runoff and domestic sewage maintained a chemical status quo as these sources were not impacted by the nationwide confinement or their residence time was longer than the characteristic time of the perturbation.

The resultant models are capable of extending the original interpretation of the data to depict alluvium layers as individual lithological units within the 2D space. By tuning the variogram parameters used in this approach, it is then possible to visualize individual lithofacies and geomorphological features for these lithologic units. The study re-examines an electrical resistivity dataset collected as part of a groundwater study in an area of the Bannu basin in Pakistan. Additional lithological logs from boreholes throughout the area have been combined with the existing resistivity data for calibration. Tectonic activity during the Himalayan orogeny uplifted and generated significant faulting in the rocks resulting in the formation of a depression which subsequently has been filled with clay-silt and dirty sand facies typical of lacustrine and flood plain environments. Streams arising from adjacent mountains have reworked these facies which have been eroded and replaced by gravel-sand facies along channels. It is concluded that the sediments have been deposited as prograding fan shaped bodies, flood plain, and lacustrine deposits. Clay-silt facies mark the locations of paleo depressions or lake environments, which have changed position over time due to local tectonic activity and sedimentation. The Lakki plain alluvial system has thus formed as a result of local tectonic activity with fluvial erosion and deposition characterized by coarse sediments with high electrical resistivities near the mountain ranges and fine sediments with medium to low electrical resistivities towards the basin center.","[Farid, Asam; Khalid, Perveiz] Univ Punjab, Inst Geol, Lahore, Pakistan; [Farid, Asam] Petr Inst, Dept Petr Geosci, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Jadoon, Khan Zaib] KAUST, Water Desalinat & Reuse Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Jouini, Mohammed Soufiane] Petr Inst, Dept Math, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",,"Farid, A (corresponding author), Petr Inst, Dept Petr Geosci, POB 2533, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.",asam.farid@gmail.com; perveiz.geo@pu.edu.pk; khan.jadoon@kaust.edu.sa; mjouini@pi.ac.ae,,,,,,,,10.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2014,186.0,10,,,,,6587,6604,,10.1007/s10661-014-3876-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-3876-5,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000341497800045,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there is limited knowledge on specific indicators suitable for assessing socio-environmental vulnerability that address altitude-related variations. This study systematically analysed important components of vulnerability and mapped them by weight for four altitude zones in the Indian Himalayas. Indices focusing on components of the three different dimensions of vulnerability (adaptive capacity, exposure, sensitivity) were identified based on the literature. Data on these different indices were then collected through a pre-tested questionnaire-based survey of 403 randomly selected households in the four altitude zones (< 1000 (low), 1000-1500 (middle), 1500-2000 (high), > 2000 m a.s.l. (very high)) in the Garhwal Himalaya, India. Components of vulnerability dimensions were assessed and significantly contributing components were identified by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). An entropy method was used to weight the dimensions of vulnerability for the different altitude zones. Vulnerability was estimated based on the Manush approach of human development index. The data were used to produce a spatial map based on a proposed Spatial Social Vulnerability Index (SSEVI). SSEVI was proposed based on social and environmental indicators of vulnerability with a mix of spatial indicators to generate spatially bound vulnerability. The results indicated that communities in the middle and high altitude zones (1000-2000 m a.s.l.) were more vulnerable (score 0.32 and 0.31, respectively) than those in the low and very high zones (score 0.29 and 0.30, respectively). Greater vulnerability was mainly due to high exposure to extreme events and less adaptive capacity, which can affect agricultural production negatively, in combination with high population density in middle-altitude communities. There was lower pressure on natural resources and better connectivity in the low altitude zone (< 1000 m a.s.l.), reducing vulnerability. The spatial SSVI map clearly revealed vulnerable hotspots, suggesting that government supported adaptation measures should not be similar across the altitude gradient in the Indian Himalayas, but should be based on available resources, pressure and livelihood options for achieving sustainability under climate change.","[Gupta, Ajay K.; Negi, Mridula; Kumar, Manoj; Pandey, Rajiv] Forest Res Inst, Dehra Dun, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Nandy, Subrata] Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Vishal] Ctr Ecol Dev & Res, Dehra Dun, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Valente, Donatella; Petrosillo, Irene] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, Lab Landscape Ecol, Lecce, Italy",,"Pandey, R (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst, Dehra Dun, Uttar Pradesh, India.",rajivfri@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,85.0,88.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2020,109.0,,,,,,,,105787,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105787,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105787,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000500940400041,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study examines the factors that affected the diffusion of the agroforestry in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region of Pakistan under BTAP. The data were gathered through in-depth interviews with Village Development Committee (VDC) members, Forest Department (FD) officials, and local farmers. Important factors positively affecting agroforestry diffusion included locations of crop fields on the river sides, community dependency on firewood, and market value of agroforestry timber. The logistic regression model shows that household head's age, access to information, and area under cropland positively affected household level adoption of agroforestry under BTAP; forest cover was negatively related. In-depth interviews show that key barriers to FD in diffusion of agroforestry included provision of false information by farmers to monitoring teams, non-availability of extension staff, lack of communication among project staff and community, as well as a lack of sufficient budget for activities. Primary barriers to community adoption of agroforestry included no participation of VDCs in planning and monitoring of agroforestry programs, lack of plant need assessments on the part of the project staff, poor quality of plants distributed by FD, farmers' poor know-how of plantations, lack of trust among community and project staff, as well as the waste of plants by farming community. Thus, this study recommends that policy-makers and project designers should consider these factors when planning agroforestry diffusion under 10-BTAP to improve its success.","[Ullah, Ayat] MNS Univ Agr, Dept Agr Extens, Multan, Pakistan; [Ullah, Ayat; Kaechele, Harald] Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Working Grp Sustainable Land Use Developing Count, Res Area 2 Land Use & Governance, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany; [Zeb, Alam] Univ Alberta, Dept Renewable Resources, 751 Gen Serv Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Zeb, Alam] Shaheed BB Univ, Dept Forestry, Sheringal Dir Upper 18050, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Saqib, Shahab E.] Higher Educ Arch & Lib Dept, Dept Commerce Educ & Management Sci, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan; [Kaechele, Harald] Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Schicklerstr 5, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany",,"Ullah, A (corresponding author), MNS Univ Agr, Dept Agr Extens, Multan, Pakistan.;Ullah, A (corresponding author), Leibniz Ctr Agr Landscape Res ZALF, Working Grp Sustainable Land Use Developing Count, Res Area 2 Land Use & Governance, Eberswalder Str 84, D-15374 Muncheberg, Germany.",ayat.ullah@mnsuam.edu.pk,,,,,,,,13.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,29.0,45,,,,,68757,68775,,10.1007/s11356-022-20661-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20661-9,,MAY 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000794109800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in the context of increasing global change, the QTP is facing increasing ecological and environmental problems, such as vegetation degradation and land surface temperature (LST) changes. Here, we first analyzed the spatiotemporal trends in the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) and the LST. Then, we explored the relationship of vegetation and LST changes to climatic factors. Finally, we calculated the response relationship of the spatial and temporal changes in vegetation and LST to global climate change. The results show that from 2001 to 2016, the vegetation coverage on the QTP showed an overall upward trend, with significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The average annual increase in the OSAVI value was 0.0071, and the areas with significant OSAVI change trends accounted for 26.3% of the study area. Both OSAVI and LST showed a significant decreasing change trend with increasing altitude. From 2001 to 2016, the LST on the QTP generally showed an upward trend, with a variation of 0.3824 degrees C. Most of the LST peaks occured around July in each year, and climate warming will cause the peak time to occur earlier. In terms of spatial distribution, the change rate of the LST trend over the southern Himalaya and Hengduan Mountains was more than 40%. The LST in this area was negatively correlated with OSAVI, and the annual mean value of OSAVI showed a negative trend in this area, with a change rate of 10%. In the QTP region, from 2001 to 2016, climate change affected vegetation growth and surface temperature trends. During the growing season, spring and summer, OSAVI had a significant positive correlations with the atmospheric temperature (AT), but not with precipitation. In the same seasons, LST and AT showed very significant positive correlations, but were not correlated with precipitation. In autumn, OSAVI had no correlation with AT or precipitation, while LST had a positive correlation with AT and precipitation.","[Zou, Fengli; Hu, Qingwu] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Zou, Fengli; Li, Haidong] Minist Ecol & Environm, Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Nanjing 210042, Peoples R China",,"Li, HD (corresponding author), Minist Ecol & Environm, Nanjing Inst Environm Sci, Nanjing 210042, Peoples R China.",zoufengli@whu.edu.cn; lihd2020@163.com,,,,,,,,49.0,51.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2020,119.0,,,,,,,,106867,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106867,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106867,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000579817600072,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most Indian rice production depends on monsoon timing and dynamics. In 2002, the lowest monsoon precipitation of the last 130+ years was observed. It coincided with the worst rice production anomaly recorded by FAOSTAT from 1961 to 2014. In that year, freshwater limitation was blamed as responsible for the yield losses in the southeastern coastal regions. Given the important implication for local food security and international market stability, we here investigate the specific mechanisms behind the effects of this extreme meteorological drought on rice yield at the national and regional levels. To this purpose, we integrate output from the hydrological model, surface, and satellite observations for the different rice cropping cycles into state-of-the-art and novel climate indicators. In particular, we adopt the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) as an indicator of drought due to the local surface water balance anomalies (i.e., precipitation and evapotranspiration). We propose a new indicator of the renewable surface freshwater availability due to non-local sources, i.e., the standardized river discharge index (SDI) based on the anomalies of modelled river discharge data. We compare these indicators to the soil moisture observations retrieved from satellites. We link all diagnostics to the recorded yields at the national and regional level, quantifying the long-term correlations and the best match of the 2002 anomaly. Our findings highlight the need for integrating non-local surface freshwater dynamics with local rainfall variability to determine the soil moisture conditions in rice fields for yields assessment, modeling, and forecasting.","[Zampieri, Matteo; Garcia, Gema Carmona; Dentener, Frank; Salamon, Peter; Seguini, Lorenzo; Toreti, Andrea] EC, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Gumma, Murali Krishna] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Remote Sensing GIS Lab, Innovat Syst Drylands Program ISD, Patancheru 502324, Andhra Pradesh, India",,"Zampieri, M (corresponding author), EC, JRC, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",matteo.zampieri@ec.europa.eu; Gema.CARMONA-GARCIA@ec.europa.eu; frank.dentener@ec.europa.eu; M.Gumma@cgiar.org; peter.salamon@ec.europa.eu; lorenzo.seguini@ec.europa.eu; andrea.toreti@ec.europa.eu,,,,,,,,23.0,23.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2018,10.0,2,,,,,,,244,10.3390/rs10020244,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10020244,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000427542100089,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Kashmir Himalaya, Srinagar city is bestowed with a large number of picturesque wetlands. These wetlands are important in regulating ecosystem services such as providing fresh water supplies, food products, fisheries, water purification, harbor biodiversity, and regulation of regional climate. These are also important as socio-economic support systems for the city inhabitants and valued as habitats of migratory birds that visit Kashmir valley from different continents of the world. Owing to the increased rate of anthropogenic activities and anthropogenically driven changes in natural processes, these wetlands are degrading at an alarming rate, seriously affecting their health and water quality. The major threats to wetlands include pollution, land use and land cover changes, urbanization and encroachments, and climate change. The intensive agricultural practices, introduction of exotic species, and changes in hydrological flows during the past few decades have resulted in degradation of wetlands over this region. Sustainable management of wetlands is crucial as these ecosystems offer an array of ecological functions that sustain livelihoods all over the world.

Experimental studies showed the mortality of vultures to be due to renal failure caused by diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. India, Pakistan, and Nepal banned the veterinary usage of diclofenac in 2006 to prevent further decline in vulture population. This study was performed to know the current status of the impact of diclofenac on vultures in India. Between 2011 and 2014, 44 vultures comprising two species, namely Indian white-backed vulture (32) and Himalayan griffon Gyps himalayensis (12) were collected dead from Gujarat, Assam, and Tamil Nadu on an opportunistic basis. Kidney and liver tissues and gut content were analysed for diclofenac. Of the 32 dead white-backed vultures analysed, 68.75% of them had diclofenac ranging from 62.28 to 272.20 ng/g.

This contrasts with the prevalent response of glaciers to climate change, which is recession and initial increase in glacier discharge followed by decline as retreat continues. We comparatively analyzed multi-timescale variation in temperature-precipitation-snow cover-runoff in the Yarkant River Basin (YRK), Karakax River Basin (KRK), Yurungkax River Basin (YUK), and Keriya River Basin (KRY) in the NSWKM. The Mann-Kendall trend and the mutation-detection method were applied to data obtained from an observation station over the last 60 years (1957-2017) and MODIS snow data (2001-2016). NSWKM temperature and precipitation have continued to increase for nearly 60 years at a mean rate of 0.26 degrees C/decade and 5.50 mm/decade, respectively, with the most obvious trend (R-2 > 0.82) attributed to the KRK and YUK. Regarding changes in the average snow-cover fraction (SCF): YUK (SCF = 44.14%) > YRK (SCF = 38.73%) > KRY (SCF = 33.42%) > KRK (SCF = 33.40%). Between them, the YRK and YUK had decreasing SCA values (slope < -15.39), while the KRK and KRY had increasing SCA values (slope > 1.87). In seasonal variation, the SCF of the three of the basins reaches the maximum value in spring, with the most significant performance in YUK (SCF = 26.4%), except for YRK where SCF in spring was lower than that in winter (-2.6%). The runoff depth of all river basins presented an increasing trend, with the greatest value appearing in the YRK (5.78 mm/decade), and the least value in the YUK (1.58 mm/decade). With the runoff response to climate change, temperature was the main influencing factor of annual and monthly (summer) runoff variations in the YRK, which is consistent with the runoff-generation rule of rivers in arid areas, which mainly rely on ice and snow melt for water supply. However, this rule was not consistent for the YUK and KRK, as it was disturbed by other factors (e.g., slope and slope direction) during runoff generation, resulting in disruptions of their relationship with runoff. This research promotes the study of the response of cold and arid alpine regions to global change and thus better serve regional water resources management.","[Ma, Xiaofei] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xiaofei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Yan, Wei] Xinyang Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chengyi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Kundzewicz, Zbigniew W.] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Agr & Forest Environm, PL-61819 Poznan, Poland",,"Yan, W (corresponding author), Xinyang Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China.;Zhao, CY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",maxiaofei171@mails.ucas.ac.com; yanwei.jw@xynu.edu.cn; zhaocy@nuist.edu.cn; kundzewicz@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,17.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019,11.0,11,,,,,,,2246,10.3390/w11112246,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11112246,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000502264500048,View Full Record in Web of Science

A large-scale uplift deformation occurred in the northern subsidence area of the co-seismic deformation field, with a maximum uplift of ~80 mm within 4.5 yr after the mainshock. While in the southern coseismic uplift area, the direction of the post-seismic deformation is generally opposite to the co-seismic deformation.

Non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend tests and Sen's slope estimates indicate snow cover increases throughout the winter, but decreases significantly between June and July. In contrast, GB has an overall increasing annual LST trend. Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) reveals a significant positive relationship between vegetation and LST (PCC = 0.73) and a significant negative relationship between LST and snow cover (PCC = - 0.74), and vegetation and snow cover (PCC = - 0.78). Observed temperature data and MODIS LST have a coefficient of determination greater than 0.59. Snow cover decreases at 3000-2000 masl elevations while increases at higher 5000 masl elevations.The vegetation in low and mid-elevation < 4000 masl zones decreases significantly annually. The temperature shows a sharply increasing trend at lower 2000-3000 masl elevations in the autumn, indicating the shifting of the winter seasons at this elevation zone. These findings better explain the spatiotemporal variations in snow cover, vegetation, and LST at various elevation zones and the interactions between these parameters at various elevations across the HKH region.","[Satti, Zulqarnain; Ali, Sikandar; Abdullaev, Farkhod; Li, Lanhai] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Satti, Zulqarnain; Ali, Sikandar; Abdullaev, Farkhod; Li, Lanhai] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Naveed, Muhammad] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Key Lab Geog Proc & Ecol Secur Changbai Mt, Minist Educ, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Shafeeque, Muhammad] Univ Bremen, Inst Geog, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Ashraf, Tauseef Muhammad] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Fac Agrobiol Food & Nat Resources, Dept Water Resources, Kamycka 129, Prague 16500 6, Czech Republic; [Irshad, Muhammad] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Environm Sci, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad 22060, Pakistan; [Li, Lanhai] Chinese Acad Sci, Tianshan Stn Snow Cover & Avalanche Res, Xinyuan 835800, Peoples R China; [Li, Lanhai] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China",,"Li, LH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.;Li, LH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Li, LH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Tianshan Stn Snow Cover & Avalanche Res, Xinyuan 835800, Peoples R China.;Li, LH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecol & Environm Cent Asia, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",satti@mails.ucas.ac.cn; nawd938@nenu.edu.cn; shafeequ@uni-bremen.de; alisikandar26@mails.ucas.ac.cn; abdullaevfarkhod87@gmail.com; xasht001@studenti.czu.cz; mirshad@cuiatd.edu.pk; lilh@ms.xjb.ac.cn,,,,,,,,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2023,30.0,7,,,,,19149,19166,,10.1007/s11356-022-23445-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-23445-3,,OCT 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000866322100013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using data from ecological investigations, remote sensing and participant observations, the nexus of socioeconomy, forest management and conservation of medicinal plants can be analyzed. In the current study, we employed a similar approach to study the impact of forest and vegetation cover, socioeconomic changes on plant distribution and use in remote and rural districts of Nepal. We have used remote-sensing data to analyze the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) as proxies to analyze the changes in forest cover and vegetation. Informant interviews and group discussions were held with local participants to assess their opinion about the uses and distribution of plants, forests and vegetation. While the overall vegetation cover was decreasing, a fluctuated pattern was recorded with a reduction in NDVI from 2000 to 2008, and subsequent increase after that. A positive correlation between LAI and NDVI was found, but the index varied spatially and temporally and sometimes was negatively correlated as NDVI saturated and became insensitive. Due to decreasing old-growth primary forests, land-use changes, and increasing sociocultural transformations, we found that the tradition of transhumance and collection of indigenous medicinal plants were rapidly being changed and the non-indigenous plants were increasingly being collected from the accessible forest areas and human-derived landscapes. These changes help us conclude that the salient sites and species are being assimilated in the local traditions; making traditional systems more versatile, diverse and adaptive.","[Kunwar, Ripu M.; Evans, Aaron] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Geosci, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Mainali, Janardan] Portland State Univ, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Ansari, Abdul S.] UNDP Climate Change Program, Jumla, Nepal; [Rimal, Bhagawat] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bussmann, Rainer W.] Saving Knowledge, Casilla 13092, La Paz, Bolivia",,"Kunwar, RM (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Geosci, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",rkunwar@fau.edu; evans26@fau.edu; jmainali23@gmail.com; abdulsahim.ansari@gmail.com; bhagawatrimal@gmail.com; rbussmann@gmail.com,,,,,,,,18.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2020,22.0,2,,,,,1397,1412,,10.1007/s10668-018-0254-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-018-0254-4,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000511659800034,View Full Record in Web of Science

The E-W trending reverse DF, which is inferred to go through the southern margin of Shillong Plateau (SP), has played major role in the regional deformation of the adjoining areas and was believed to be active during the Late Quaternary time. Previous paleoseismological studies conducted on the eastern and western part of the DF, Bangladesh, revealed that the fault ruptured in AD 849-920 and AD 1548, respectively. However, there were no studies on the DF from southern side of the SP, India. For the first time, from Indian side, soft sediment deformation structures (SSDS) are reported from five trenches in and around the DF zone, SP. Close to the Dauki village, five trenches in the eastern part of the DF, SP, show micro faulting, sand dykes, disturbed strata, and water escape structures. The detailed investigation of SSDS indicates that the origin of deformation is seismic trigger. The C-14 AMS dating of deformation structures generated by earthquakes suggests three seismic events occurred between 130 and 920 year BP, 5415 to 9140 year BP, and at about 4285 year BP. This study confirms that DF is indeed active, at least, since the mid-Holocene. More trenching and dating of seismically induced deformation features are needed to accurately calculate the recurrence interval of significant earthquakes that can strike the fast-expanding urban areas in India and Bangladesh.","[Lakshmi, B.

Methodology : Four lytic phages (PFPD, PFPK, PFPN and PFPC) were isolated against ten isolates of pathogenic P. fluorescens following overlay method using water and bottom sediments of Himalayan and Sub Himalayan regions. One step growth experiment was carried out to know the eclipse, latent periods and burst size of phages. Phage genomic DNA was extracted following chloroform: phenol: isoamyl method and digested using restriction enzymes (EcoRl and Hind III) (Bangalore genei, Bangalore) and isolation of phage protein was made as per Laemmli (1970) with slight modification. Results : Phages were identified as a member of family Siphoviridae (isometric head of 236.42nm and non-contractile long tail of 521.22 nm) with having ds DNA of 20-21 kbp and structural viral proteins of 22 102 kDa. Phages exhibited minimum eclipse period (10-15 min), latent period (20 min) and highest burst size of 130. These phages conferred clear lytic plaques in the lawn of 8 of 10 (80%) host bacterium at 0.01 MOl, tolerated wide range of temperature (25 to 35 degrees C), pH (6.5 to 8.0), yielded highest titer (10(8)pfu) at 30 +/- 5 degrees C and exhibited highest (99%) in vitro lytic activities. The host bacterium did not develop resistance to all the phages studied during the entire period of the study. Interpretation : The profound in vitro lytic attributes of PFPD and PFPK phages and their tolerance to temperature and pH at par with aquaculture activities reveals that they may be a suitable option to alleviate transmission of even systematic P. fluorescens infection in hatchery and culture system. This information will provide more insight into the potential use of phage to mitigate incidences of Bacterial Haemorrhagic Septicaemia in aquaculture.","[Dinkar, N.; Sharma, A.

Taking the 2015 Gorkha earthquake as a reference, this paper reviews the past and present geodetic activities in Nepal. It presents the history of conventional Nepal datum as a horizontal datum and Indian mean sea level-based vertical datum, and modern satellite geodesy works on the Himalayas. Considering recent earthquakes, continuous crustal motion, international and global compliance, and increasing demand for precise positional accuracy from the users and stakeholders, this paper discusses future directions to build, establish, maintain, and operate modern terrestrial, height, and gravity reference systems and frames.

Therefore, research on the dynamics of glacier changes and their relationship with climate and topographic variability is essential for sustainable water resource management and adaptation strategies in Pakistan. In this contribution, we delineated 187 glaciers and examined these glacier changes in the Shigar Basin from 1973 to 2020 using Corona, Landsat Operational Land Imager/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus/Thematic Mapper/Multispectral Scanner System (OLI/ETM/TM/MSS), Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF), and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) imageries. The total glacier area decreased from 2796.31 +/- 132 km(2) in 1973 to 2756.27 +/- 63 km(2) in 2020 at an average rate of - 0.83 +/- 0.03 km(2)yr(-1). Specifically, during the period of 1990-2000, these glaciers shrank most heavily at an average rate of - 2.372 +/- 0.08 km(2)yr(-1). In contrast, an increased rate of 0.57 +/- 0.02 km(2)yr(-1) in total glacier area was observed during the recent decade (2010-2020). Moreover, the glaciers with gentle slopes retreated less heavily than the steep ones. There was reduction in glacier coverage and length for all slope classes, and a small reduction was observed with gentle slopes, while higher losses were observed on steep slope gradients. The transition of glaciers in the Shigar Basin may be attributed by the direct influence of glacier size and topographical characteristics. By comparing with climate records, our findings suggest that the overall reduction in glacier area from 1973 to 2020 was associated with declining precipitation (- 0.78 mmm/year) and rising temperature (0.045 degrees C/year) trends in the region, and glacier advances in recent decade (2010-2020) were likely to be driven by increased winter and autumn precipitation.","[Ali, Sajid; Kheirandish, Somayeh] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, D-14469 Potsdam, Germany; [Ali, Sajid] GFZ German Res Ctr Geosci, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Ali, Sajid] Univ Baltistan, Skardu 16100, Pakistan; [Khan, Garee; Qureshi, Javed Akhter] Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan; [Hassan, Mujtaba] Inst Space Technol, Dept Space Sci, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Ali, Sajid] Climate Analyt, Berlin, Germany",,"Khan, G (corresponding author), Karakoram Int Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan.",garee.khan@kiu.edu.pk,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2023,30.0,30,,,,,74889,74899,,10.1007/s11356-023-27648-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-27648-0,,MAY 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000993049100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Changes in snow-melt timing have profound effects on eco-physiological characteristics of alpine plant species through alterations in growing season length. Here, we conducted a field experiment and studied species response to experimentally induced early snow-melting (ES) (natural vs. early) at an alpine site (Rohtang) in the western Himalaya region. Eco-physiological response of eight snow-bed restricted alpine plant species from different elevations (lower: 3850 m and upper: 4150 m amsl) and belonging to contrasting resource acquisition strategies (conservative and acquisitive) were studied after 2-years (2019 & 2020) of initiating ES field experiment. We estimated the functional traits related to leaf economic spectrum and physiological performance and assessed their pattern of phenotypic plasticity. Analysis by linear mixed effect model showed that both the 'conservative' and 'acquisitive' species had responded to ES with significant effects on species specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf thickness, leaf water content and sugar content. Our results also revealed that ES treatment induced significant increase in leaf C/N ratio (10.57 % to 13.65 %) and protein content (15.85 % to 20.76 %) at both the elevations, irrespective of species groups. The phenotypic plasticity was found to be low and was essentially species-specific. However, for leaf protein content, the upper elevation species exhibited a higher phenotypic plasticity (0.43 +/- 0.18) than the lower elevation species (0.31 +/- 0.21). Interestingly, we found that irrespective of species unique functional strategy, species adapt to perform more conservative at lower elevation and more acquisitive at upper elevation, in response to ES. We conclude that plants occurring at contrasting elevations respond differentially to ES. However, species showed capacity for short-term acclimation to future environmental conditions, but may be vulnerable, if their niche is occupied by new species with greater phenotypic plasticity and a superior competitive ability.","[Chawla, Amit] CSIR Inst Himalayan Bioresource Technol CSIR IHBT, Environm Technol Div, Palampur 176061, Himachal Prades, India; Acad Sci & Innovat Res AcSIR, Ghaziabad 201002, India; Res Ctr CSIR IHBT, Ctr High Altitude Biol CeHAB, PO Tandi, Palampur 175132, Himachal Prades, India",,"Chawla, A (corresponding author), CSIR Inst Himalayan Bioresource Technol CSIR IHBT, Environm Technol Div, Palampur 176061, Himachal Prades, India.",amitchawla21@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 10,2024,907.0,,,,,,,,167906,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167906,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167906,,OCT 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001102668200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To investigate the distribution, transport and controlling factors of Hg in glacier-fed runoff, from June 2019 to July 2020, a continuous monitoring and an intensive sampling campaign were conducted in the Rongbuk Glacier-fed basin (RGB) on the north slope of Mt. Everest in the middle Himalayas. The total Hg (THg) and methyl Hg (MeHg) concentrations were 1.56 +/- 0.85 and 0.057 +/- 0.025 ng/L, respectively, which were comparable to the global background levels and were mainly affected by the total suspended particulate matter (TSP). In addition, THg and MeHg showed significant diurnal variations, with peak values appearing at approximately 17:00 (upstream) and 19:00 (downstream). Based on the annual runoff and average Hg concentration, the annual export fluxes of THg and MeHg were estimated to be 441 g and 16 g, respectively. The yields of THg and MeHg in the RGB were 1.6 and 0.06 mu g/m(2)/year, respectively. Currently, the annual Hg export of meltwater runoff in the Himalayan region is approximately 337 kg/year. When flowing through the proglacial lake, the THg concentrations decreased by 32% and 15% in the proglacial lake water and in the outlet, respectively, indicating that proglacial lakes had a sedimentation effect on the Hg transport. The Hg export from meltwater runoff in the Himalayas will likely increase considering the meltwater runoff has been projected to increase in the future. Nonetheless, emerging proglacial lakes may exert ambiguous effects on the glacier exported Hg under changing climate. Proglacial lakes could lower the levels and amounts of Hg in the glacier runoff, whereas the outburst of proglacial lakes could lead to an instantaneous release of Hg stored in lake waters and sediments. Our analysis shed light on the environmental impact of glacier retreat in the Himalayas and highlighted the need for integrated monitoring and study of Hg in glacier runoff and glacial lakes.","[Sun, Xuejun; Shi, Jianbo] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Hangzhou Inst Adv Study, Sch Environm, Hangzhou 310024, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qianggong; Li, Mingyue; Li, Shengnan; Dong, Huike; Wang, Xiaoping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resource, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xuejun; Shi, Jianbo] Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Eco Environm Sci, State Key Lab Environm Chem & Ecotoxicol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Guoshuai] Chinese Acad Environm Planning, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Guo, Junming; Kang, Shichang] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Eco Environm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Kang, Shichang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jianbo] China Univ Geosciences, Sch Environm Studies, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, Q (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resource, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",qianggong.zhang@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,7.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 30,2022,218.0,,,,,,,,118474,10.1016/j.watres.2022.118474,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118474,,APR 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000891306000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results demonstrated that on an average out of total annual rainfall (i.e., 2028 mm), about 46% of the rainfall convert to surface runoff and 35% loss to atmosphere via evapo-transpiration (ET), while the remaining 18% contribute to infiltrate the groundwater recharge.

Trophic guild structure and niche organization in wintering waterbirds were studied to understand why some species were rare and some were abundant and what possibly determined the diversity and abundance of multi-species waterbird communities. Two trophic components of niche partitioning, namely foraging habitat and foraging techniques, were considered in the present study. Cluster analyses based on foraging habitats and foraging techniques (i.e., two dimensions) provided bi-dimensional foraging guilds. Waterbirds precisely formed five distinct guilds, namely, medium and shallow water generalists, stalking waders, pecking waders, mud picking wader and divers. Further, a much higher diversity of waterbirds was observed from shallow and medium water habitats than deep waters which could be the outcome of higher net available trophic energy. Potential competitive interactions within infra-guild members were possibly minimized by using varied feeding techniques. The present study pointed out that the specialist guild members showed comparatively higher intraguild niche overlap, whereas generalist guild members showed much lower niche overlap. Results indicated that waterbird communities were influenced mostly by trophic resources at a site and the birds' ability to exploit them. Waterbird guild structures and niche characteristics thus provide important ecological indicators of the ability of wetlands to support a range of species. Further, information on guild structures and niche characteristics are surely important for monitoring the biotic health of sub-Himalayan wetlands that would be important to work out effective wetland conservation strategies.","[Chatterjee, Asitava] Off Div Forest Officer, Kangsabati South Div, Purulia 723101, W Bengal, India; [Adhikari, Shuvadip; Pal, Sudin; Mukhopadhyay, Subhra Kumar] Govt Coll Engn & Leather Technol, Ecotoxicol & Environm Technol Project Lab, LB 3, Kolkata 700098, W Bengal, India; [Pal, Sudin] Jadavpur Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Kolkata 700032, W Bengal, India",,"Pal, S (corresponding author), Govt Coll Engn & Leather Technol, Ecotoxicol & Environm Technol Project Lab, LB 3, Kolkata 700098, W Bengal, India.",sudindgp1@gmail.com,,,,,,,,27.0,32.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2020,108.0,,,,,,,,105693,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105693,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105693,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000493902400024,View Full Record in Web of Science

The snow and glacier meltwater contribution feeds 10 major river basins downstream including Astore, Gilgit, Hunza, Jhelum, Kabul, Shyok and Shigar. Climate change is likely to fluctuate the runoff generated from such river basins concerning high and low streamflows. Widening the lens of focus, the present study examines the magnitude and timing of high flows variability as well as trends variability in low streamflows using Sen's slope and the Mann-Kendall test in UIB from 1981 to 2016. The results revealed that the trend in the magnitude of the high flows decreased at most of the sub-basins including the Jhelum, Indus and Kabul River basins. Significantly increased high flows were observed in the glacier regime of UIB at Shigar and Shyok while decreased flows were predominant in Hunza River at Daniyor Bridge. A similar proclivity of predominantly reduced flows was observed in nival and rainfall regimes in terms of significant negative trends in the Jhelum, Kunhar, Neelum and Poonch River basins. The timing of the high flows has not changed radically as magnitude at all gauging stations. For the low flows, decreasing significant trends were detected in the annual flows as well as in other extremes of low flows (1-day, 7-day, 15-day). The more profound and decreasing pattern of low flows was observed in summer at most of the gauging stations; however, such stations exhibited increased low flows in autumn, winter and spring. The decrease in low flows indicates the extension of dry periods particularly in summer. The high-water demand in summer will be compromised due to consistently reducing summer flows; the lower the water availability, the lower will be the crop yield and electricity generation.","[Yaseen, Muhammad] Univ Punjab, Ctr Integrated Mt Res CIMR, Qaid & Azam Campus, Lahore 53720, Pakistan; [Latif, Yasir] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Comp Sci, Prague 18207, Czech Republic; [Latif, Yasir] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Waseem, Muhammad] Ghulam Ishaq Khan Inst Engn Sci & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Topi 23460, Pakistan; [Leta, Megersa Kebede] Univ Rostock, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, D-18059 Rostock, Germany; [Abbas, Sohail] Konkuk Univ, Climate Res Inst, Seoul 100011, South Korea; [Akram Bhatti, Haris] NED Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Karachi 75200, Pakistan",,"Latif, Y (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Comp Sci, Prague 18207, Czech Republic.;Latif, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Leta, MK (corresponding author), Univ Rostock, Fac Agr & Environm Sci, D-18059 Rostock, Germany.",yaseen.cimr@pu.edu.pk; latif@cs.cas.cz; muhammad.waseem@giki.edu.pk; megersa.kebede@uni-rostock.de; sohail.konkuk@gmail.com; bhatti@neduet.edu.pk,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2022,14.0,3,,,,,,,337,10.3390/w14030337,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14030337,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000754661100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Snow and glacier meltwater from the Karakoram and the western Himalayas, which supplies the Indus River Basin, provide an essential source of water to more than 215 million people, either directly, as potable water, or indirectly, through hydroelectric generation and irrigation for crops. This study focuses on water resources in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) which combines the ranges of the Hindukush, Karakoram and Himalaya (HKH). Specifically, we focus on the Gilgit River Basin (GRB) to inform more sustainable water use policy at the sub-basin scale. We employ two degree-day approaches, the Spatial Processes in Hydrology (SPHY) and Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM), to simulate runoff in the GRB during 2001-2012. The performance of SRM was poor during July and August, the period when glacier melt contribution typically dominates runoff. Consequently, SPHY outperformed SRM, likely attributable to SPHY's ability to discriminate between glacier, snow, and rainfall contributions to runoff during the ablation period. The average simulated runoff revealed the prevalent snowmelt contribution as 62%, followed by the glacier melt 28% and rainfall 10% in GRB. We also assessed the potential impact of climate change on future water resources, based on two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). We estimate that summer flows are projected to increase by between 5.6% and 19.8% due to increased temperatures of between 0.7 and 2.6 degrees C over the period 2039-2070. If realized, increased summer flows in the region could prove beneficial for a range of sectors, but only over the short to medium term and if not associated with extreme events. Long-term projections indicate declining water resources in the region in terms of snow and glacier melt.","[Latif, Yasir; Ma, Yaoming; Ma, Weiqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yaoming; Ma, Weiqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Muhammad, Sher] Yunnan Univ, Inst Int Rivers & Ecosecur, Kunming 650500, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Muhammad, Sher] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Adnan, Muhammad] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Yaseen, Muhammad] Univ Punjab, Ctr Integrated Mt Res, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Fealy, Rowan] Maynooth Univ, Dept Geog, ICARUS, Maynooth W23 F2K8, Kildare, Ireland",,"Latif, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yasirlatif@itpcas.ac.cn; ymma@itpcas.ac.cn; wqma@itpcas.ac.cn; Sher.Muhammad@icimod.org; adnan@lzb.ac.cn; yaseen.cimr@pu.edu.pk; rowan.fealy@mu.ie,,,,,,,,34.0,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2020,11.0,10,,,,,,,1023,10.3390/atmos11101023,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11101023,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000585648100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ionic dominance of anions followed the trend as HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3-, whereas ionic dominancy of cations varied as: Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ > Na+ for both the years. High share of (Ca + Mg) in the total cations and also dominancy of (Ca + Mg) over (Na + K) for both the years demonstrate that solute acquisition processes in the meltwater of Bara Shigri glacier are mainly governed by the weathering of carbonates. The Piper plot identified Ca-HCO3 as the dominant water type followed by CaSO4 type of water in the study area. The average value of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco(2)) for meltwater of the Bara Shigri glacier was 10(-2.6) atm in 2012 and 10(-2.3) atm in 2013 and were higher than the Pco2 value of atmosphere (10(-3.5) atm). It indicates that the meltwater is in disequilibrium with respect to the atmosphere. Contents of suspended sediment in the meltwater were 1432 mg/l in July and 596 mg/l in September 2012, whereas in 2013, suspended sediment contents were 1093 mg/l in August and 425 mg/l in September, following discharge pattern of the Bara Shigri glacier. We found that Bara Shigri and Gangotri glaciers demonstrate the higher rate of regional melting.","[Singh, Virendra Bahadur; Ramanathan, A.

We first calibrated the Open Global Glacier Model over the study region and then conducted simulations for the present (forced by ERA-Interim) and future (forced by CMIP5 models) climates. For the present climate, the model simulations show that 50% of the total glacier volume (compared to 1980) is lost by 2011, with glacier area and volume showing a significantly decreasing trend, with higher fluctuations in the glacial area during recent decades. Future projections suggest 75% loss by 2040 +/- 2.5 years and similar to 90% loss by 2094 +/- 3.5 years under RCP4.5. Under RCP8.5, 75% loss is expected to occur by 2040 +/- 3 years and similar to 90% loss by 2084 +/- 8 years. Ensemble mean of the near-surface air temperature (both monthly mean and annual mean) shows a significantly increasing trend under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for the entire 21st century. Ensemble mean of the total monthly precipitation shows no trend under RCP4.5, however, it shows a decreasing trend for months ODJFMA and an increasing trend for months JJ under RCP8.5. An increase in JJ precipitation does not increase glacier mass since this region does not receive snowfall during these months. Under RCP4.5, snowfall does not show any significant trend during NDJF, however, it shows a decreasing trend during October and March. Under RCP8.5, snowfall shows a significant decreasing trend for October through March. Overall, we find similar melting rates under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 until similar to 2050, but the latter shows a higher rate afterward.","[Dixit, Ankur; Sahany, Sandeep] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Atmospher Sci, New Delhi 110016, India; [Sahany, Sandeep] Ctr Climate Res Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; [Kulkarni, Anil, V] Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India",,"Dixit, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Ctr Atmospher Sci, New Delhi 110016, India.",ankur.dixit@cas.iitd.ac.in,,,,,,,,17.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1,2021,295.0,,,,,,,,113101,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113101,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113101,,JUN 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000680023400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main Bhagirathi river, tributary streams and springs and groundwater are the main sources of water for the reservoir and inhabitant living around it. Fifty-two water samples were collected from springs, handpumps (borewell) and streams and were analysed for major ions. The pH is varying from 6.8 to 8.6 and EC from 28 to 820 mu S/cm. The chemical composition of water is dominated by Ca, Mg and HCO3. The high ratio of Ca + Mg/Na + K and low ratio of Na + K/TZ indicate dominance of carbonate dissolution as the main solute acquisition process in this part of Lesser Himalaya. The trilinear and X-Y plots suggest less contribution from silicate weathering and anthropogenic activities. The excess of Na over Cl indicating much of the alkalis in the waters of Tehri area have source other than precipitation possibly from silicate weathering. Recharged by meteoric water, the quality of water in the study area is controlled essentially by chemical processes occurring between water and lithology and locally altered by human activities. Among the trace metals the concentration of Fe at few locations has marginally exceeded the WHO and BIS standards of drinking water. The analytical result computed from various water quality indices indicate fairly good quality of water for both drinking and irrigation purposes. The factor analysis performed on the major ion data indicate two factors are the most important affecting the water quality of the area.","[Dudeja, Divya; Bartarya, S. K.; Khanna, P.

Present study was focused on estimating the current and simulating the future LULC and LST trends in the alpine environment of lower Himalayan region of Pakistan. Past patterns of LULC and LST were identified through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and multi-spectral Landsat satellite images during 1987-2017 data period. The Cellular automata (CA) model and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were applied to simulate future (years 2032 and 2047) LULC and LST changes, respectively, using their past patterns. CA model was validated for the simulated and the estimated LULC for the year 2017 with an overall Kappa (K) value of 0.77 using validation modules in QGIS and IDRISI software. ANN method was validated by correlating the observed and simulated LST for the year 2017 with correlation coefficient (R) and Mean Square Error (MSE) values of 0.81 and 0.51, respectively. Results indicated a change in the LULC and LST for instance the built-up area was increased by 4.43% while agricultural area and bare soil were reduced by 2.74% and 4.42%, respectively, from 1987 to 2017. The analysis of LST for different LULC classes indicated that built-up area has highest temperature followed by barren, agriculture and vegetation surfaces. Simulation of future LULC and LST showed that the built-up area will be increased by 2.27% (in 2032) and 4.13% (in 2047) which led 42% (in 2032) and 60% (in 2047) of the study area as compared to 26% area (in 2017) to experience LST greater than 27 degrees C. A strong correlation between built-up area changes and LST was thus found signifying major challenge to urban planners mitigating the consequent of Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon.

Intense rainfall, cultivation along steep slopes, unscientific land-use changes, shifting cultivation, soil acidity, and nutrient mining in hills and mountains make agriculture unsustainable and less profitable. Hills and mountain ecosystems of the Eastern Himalayan Region (EHR) are further prone to the impact of climate change posing a serious threat to agricultural production and the environment. Increasing soil carbon reserves contributes to multiple ecosystem services, improves soil nutrient and water-holding capacities, and advances climate-resilient agriculture. Thus, carbon sequestration is increasingly becoming an important aspect of farming among researchers in the region. The EHR predominantly practices shifting cultivation that degrades the ecosystem and promotes land degradation and biodiversity loss. Leaching of exchangeable bases is highly favored due to excess rainfall which in turn creates an acidic soil accounting for >84% of the region. Application of lime to raise the soil acidity for the cultivation of crops did not get adequate acceptance among the farming community due to multiple issues such as cost involvement, non-availability in time and place, and transportation issues. The application of biochar as soil amendments is widely known to improve soil's physical, chemical, and biological properties. Biochar has also emerged as a potential candidate for long-term carbon sequestration due to its inbuilt structure and higher stability. Shift from traditional slash and burn culture to slash and char might lead to the sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere. Around 0.21 Pg of carbon (12% of the total anthropogenic carbon emissions by land-use change) can be sequestered in the soil if the traditional slash and burnt practice is converted to slash and char. The objective of this review is to provide detailed information about the role of biochar in altering the soil properties for sustaining agriculture and carbon sequestration, especially for hills and mountain ecosystems.","[Layek, Jayanta; Narzari, Rumi; Hazarika, Samarendra; Rangappa, Krishnappa; Devi, Shidayaichenbi; Balusamy, Arumugam; Choudhury, Burhan Uddin] ICAR Res Complex North East Hill Reg, Umiam 793103, Meghalaya, India; [Das, Anup; Mishra, Vinay Kumar] ICAR Res Complex North East Hill Reg, Tripura Ctr, Agartala 799001, Tripura, India; [Saha, Saurav] ICAR Res Complex North East Hill Reg, Sikkim Ctr, Gangtok 737102, Sikkim, India; [Mandal, Sandip] ICAR Cent Inst Agr Engn, Bhopal 462038, Madhya Pradesh, India; [Idapuganti, Ramkrushna Gandhiji] ICAR Cent Inst Cotton Res, Nagpur 440010, Maharashtra, India; [Babu, Subhash] ICAR Indian Agr Res Inst, Delhi 110012, India",,"Layek, J (corresponding author), ICAR Res Complex North East Hill Reg, Umiam 793103, Meghalaya, India.;Babu, S (corresponding author), ICAR Indian Agr Res Inst, Delhi 110012, India.",jayanta.icar@gmail.com; narzarirumi@gmail.com; samarendra.ches@gmail.com; anup_icar@yahoo.com; krishphysiology@gmail.com; shidayaish@gmail.com; enssamy@gmail.com; saurays.saha@gmail.com; smandal2604@gmail.com; ramkrushnagi@gmail.com; subhiari@gmail.com; burhan3i@yahoo.com; vkmishra63@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,16.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,14.0,11,,,,,,,6684,10.3390/su14116684,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14116684,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000809459600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the implications of grazing on biodiversity conservation and the need for sustainable management of pastures in the Manaslu Conservation Area of Nepal, we assessed grazing intensity along an elevational gradient following the Budhi Gandaki valley. The data set consisted of grazing intensities recorded every 250 m along a transect from 1400 to 5200 m above sea level and farmer interviews, after an initial satellite data analysis. Grazing and herd size were found to increase with increasing elevation, reflecting local livelihood dependency on cattle herding. Species richness was then analyzed along a grazing disturbance gradient at 7 goths (summer cattle shed) in heavily grazed areas. Disturbance was found to be moderate at intermediate distances, where species richness was found to be higher; the results agree with the generally accepted intermediate-disturbance hypothesis. The plant species not affected, even at the locations with highest grazing, were unpalatable species.

This study demonstrates the multi-disciplinary approach utilizing the multivariate statistical techniques, data from remote sensing, lab, and field-based observations for assessing the impact of massive land system changes on water quality of the river Jhelum. Land system changes over a period of 38 years have been quantified using multi-spectral satellite data to delineate the extent of different anthropogenically driven land use types that are the main non-point sources of pollution. Fifteen water quality parameters, at 12 sampling sites distributed uniformly along the length of the Jhelum, have been assessed to identify the possible sources of pollution. Our analysis indicated that 18 % of the forested area has degraded into sparse forest or scrublands from 1972 to 2010, and the areas under croplands have decreased by 24 % as people shifted from irrigation-intensive agriculture to orchard farming while as settlements showed a 397 % increase during the observation period. One-way ANOVA revealed that all the water quality parameters had significant spatio-temporal differences (p < 0.01). Cluster analysis (CA) helped us to classify all the sampling sites into three groups. Factor analysis revealed that 91.84 % of the total variance was mainly explained by five factors.

The especially high levels of nitrogen (858 +/- 405 mu gL(-1)) and phosphorus (273 +/- 18 mu gL(-1)) in the Jhelum could be attributed to the reckless application of fertilizers, pesticides, and unplanned urbanization in the area.","[Rather, Mohmmad Irshad; Shah, Irfan Yousuf] Univ Kashmir, Dept Environm Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Rashid, Irfan; Murtaza, Khalid Omar; Romshoo, Shakil Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Shahi, Nuzhat; Hassan, Khalida] Univ Kashmir, Res Dev Ctr, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Rashid, I (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",irfangis@gmail.com,,,,,,,,58.0,58.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2016,188.0,3,,,,,,,185,10.1007/s10661-016-5190-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5190-x,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000371067600037,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Gopal, B",,,,"Gopal, Brij",,,"Future of wetlands in tropical and subtropical Asia, especially in the face of climate change",AQUATIC SCIENCES,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Tropical and subtropical Asia differs from other tropical regions in its monsoonal climate and the dominant influence of the Hindukush and Himalayan mountain ranges which result in extremes of spatial and temporal variability in precipitation. However, several major rivers and their tributaries arise in the Himalayan ranges and are fed by thousands of glaciers. Huge sediment loads carried by these rivers result in important deltas at their mouths. The climatic and physiographic diversity have endowed the region with many kinds of wetlands. Of these, the peatswamps of southeast Asia constitute about 56% of the world's tropical peatlands, and more than 42% of the world's mangroves occur in South and southeast Asia. Among other wetlands, riverine swamps are rather restricted whereas the seasonal marshes are a dominant feature. Another characteristic feature of tropical Asia are the innumerable human-made and intensively managed wetlands of which the paddy fields and aquaculture ponds are the most extensive. Throughout tropical Asia, wetlands have been a part of the socio-cultural ethos of the people and many communities have lived in wetlands. However, the pressures of high population and the economic development have extensively impacted upon wetlands which have been transformed for paddy cultivation and aquaculture, drained and converted to other land uses for economic gains (e.g., conversion to oil palm), and degraded by discharge of domestic and industrial wastes. Invasive plant and animal species have also played a significant role. The climate change is already being felt in the rapid retreat of Himalayan glaciers, increased temperature and variability in precipitation as well as the frequency of extreme events. Sea level rise is seen as a major threat to the coastal wetlands, particularly the mangroves. Increasing droughts have caused frequent fires in Indonesian peat swamps that have further feedback impacts on regional climate. However, the actual threat to wetlands in this region arises from the extensive hydrological alterations being caused by storage, abstraction and diversion of river flows for agriculture, industry and hydropower. Currently, the state of our understanding wetlands in general, and the efforts and infrastructure for research and training in wetlands are very poor. Although a few wetlands have been designated as Ramsar sites, the policies aimed at wetland conservation are either non-existent or very weak. Human responses to greater uncertainty and variability in the available water resources in different parts of Asia will be crucial to the conservation of wetlands in the future.","[Gopal, Brij] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India",,"Gopal, B (corresponding author), Natl Inst Ecol, Ctr Inland Waters S Asia, 41 B Shiv Shakti Nagar, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India.",brij44@gmail.com,,,,,,,,72.0,81.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2013,75.0,1,,,,,39,61,,10.1007/s00027-011-0247-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-011-0247-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000313002400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little information is available about their current distribution in a mountainous region that is subject to increasing human-induced stressors (such as hydropower plants, pollution, sand and boulder mining, destructive fishing techniques, poaching). Owing to important roles played by these otters in structuring riverine food webs (particularly taking account of their roles as top carnivores), it is critical that they receive suitable protection in the face of projected temperature rise, change in precipitation patterns, and associated river flows in this Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. This study assesses otter distribution in four rivers of Uttarakhand as a basis for informing future conservation actions. Field surveys were conducted (October 2018-January 2019) in reaches of the Kosi, Ramganga, Khoh, and Song rivers, supported by semi-structured interviews (N = 379) conducted with members of local communities to collect qualitative data on views and perceptions of otter species. In addition, community-based otter awareness camps were organized for local youths (N = 105), adults (N = 115), and schoolchildren (N = 256 covering 10 schools). Habitat suitability maps were created using remote-sensing data, survey findings, and a geographic information system to provide information about priority reaches of river to be targeted for future conservation efforts. This study provides critical interdisciplinary baseline information to guide decision-makers towards developing a targeted, otter-specific conservation programme for this important Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. The otter conservation education programmes conducted during this study resulted in a proposal to set up a community-based conservation initiative to monitor and report otter sightings from the area, potentially representing a way forward for achieving simultaneous otter conservation and associated ecosystem benefits for local communities.","[Gupta, Nishikant; Tiwari, Varun] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Post Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Everard, Mark] UWE, Bristol, Avon, England; [Savage, Melissa] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Hussain, Syed Ainul; Johnson, Jeyaraj Antony] Wildlife Inst India, Chandrabani, Uttarakhand, India; [Chadwick, Michael A.] Kings Coll London, Dept Geog, London, England; [Nawab, Asghar] WWF India, New Delhi, India; [Nawab, Asghar] Wildlife Conservat Soc Turtle Survival Alliance I, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Gupta, N (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Post Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.",nishikantgupta@live.in,,,,,,,,4.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2020,30.0,3,,,,,601,610,,10.1002/aqc.3284,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3284,,JAN 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000509475000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study provides an assessment of the decadal land use and land cover (LULC) change and consequent changes in the distribution of soil erosion risk for the years, 1990, 2000, and 2010, for the entire country of Nepal. The study attempted to understand how different land cover types change over the three decades and how it has changed the distribution of soil erosion risks in Nepal that would help in the development of soil conservation priority. The land cover maps were produced using geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) using Landsat images. Soil erosion patterns were assessed using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) with the land cover as the input. The study shows that the forest cover is the most dominant land cover in Nepal that comprises about 6,200,000 ha forest cover. The estimated annual erosion was 129.30 million tons in 1990 and 110.53 million tons in 2010. The assessment of soil erosion dynamics was presented at the national, provincial, and district level.

Here, we investigated the effect of experimental warming on flowering phenology of selected woody plants in Kashmir Himalaya. We selected the twigs of four congeneric pairs of temperate woody species (Prunus, Populus, Ulmus, Viburnum)-typical spring-flowering plants in the region. Using randomised block design, we monitored these winter dormant twigs in controlled growth chambers to study the effect of different temperature regimes (9, 17, 20 and 23 degrees C) and species identity on the patterns of phenological shifts. We observed a significant phenological shift in all the species showing preponement in the first flower out and senescence phases ranging from 0.56 to 3.0 and 0.77 to 4.04 days per degree increase in temperature, respectively. The duration of flowering phase in all the species showed a corresponding decrease along the gradient of increasing temperature, which was more driven by preponement of the flower senescence than the start of flowering. The patterns of phenological shifts were highly species-specific, and the magnitude of these shifts significantly varied in all the four pairs of congeneric species despite their phylogenetic similarity. Our study provides experimental support to the previous long-term observation and herbarium-based studies showing that the patterns of phenological shifts in response to global climate warming are likely to vary between species, even those belonging to same evolutionary stock. Our findings highlight that a one-size-fits-all strategy to manage the likely impacts of climate warming-induced phenological shifts will seldom succeed, and should instead be designed for the specific phenological responses of species and regions.","[Hassan, Tabasum; Ahmad, Rameez; Wani, Sajad A.; Gulzar, Ruquia; Khuroo, Anzar Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Ctr Biodivers & Taxon, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, J&K, India; [Waza, Showkat A.] SKUAST Kashmir, Mt Crop Res Stn MCRS Sagam, Anantnag 192124, J&K, India",,"Khuroo, AA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Ctr Biodivers & Taxon, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, J&K, India.",anzarak@uok.edu.in,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,66.0,9,,,,,1771,1785,,10.1007/s00484-022-02317-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-022-02317-y,,JUN 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000817020600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is the first environmental and geochemical atlas for this region. It was found that natural processes are determining the distribution of the variable in this area. The granulometric features seem to be strongly influenced by land use, with coarser grain sizes in forest soils, contrasting with the finer grain sizes in agricultural soils. The map distribution of the noncarcinogenic hazard index showed that there is an expected hazard for some variables for both children and adults. Potential ecological risk is revealed to be low to moderate.

Our objective therefore was to develop a multi-method approach to support mapping of ecosystem services and assessing their local values. Local perceptions of ecosystem use, change and values were identified using participatory mapping, key informant and focus group discussions, and an extensive household survey carried out in the upstream Koshi River basin. Results were cross-validated with scientific literature, statistics and remote sensing data. Key ecosystem services identified are water, agricultural produce, and various forest products, most of which show a declining trend.

These ecotones in Himalaya remained unexplored for many ecological aspects like biodiversity, phyto-sociology, boundary detection and even impact of change in land use pattern (anthropogenic activity). The most accepted and widespread technique called as Moving Split Window (MSW) technique is used for detection of vegetation and environmental boundaries at four different sites in the lesser stratum of north-west Himalaya. All the four sites were at different distances from the nearest human inhabited area. Anthropogenic activities like grazing, herb collection, wood collection etc. were common at proximal sites. Such activities have led to the change in land use pattern. In this study, we have tried to work out the impact of the change in land use pattern (human interference) on the vegetation and basic environmental parameters like soil pH, electrical conductivity and moisture on forest-grassland ecotone in north-west Himalaya. Data on mountain steepness was also collected and analyzed. The dissimilarity profile using the statistical tool Squared Euclidian Distance (SED) indicated that species turnover locations increase with the increase in distance of ecotones from human settlements. The ecotones at distant locations from human villages are characterized with blunt as well as sharp peaks for vegetation data, however, conditions are reverse in case of the proximal sites. The study also reveals that as the distance between the ecotone and human settlements increases, the complex conditions like multiple vegetation boundaries prevails on the transitions.

The assessment of vulnerability of forests in the Indian Western Himalayan (IWH) region comprising the states of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Uttarakhand (UK) was done using six indicators of vulnerability in the form of biological richness index, disturbance index, forest canopy density, fire point intensity and forest extraction intensity of fringe forests. We express this assessment as the indicator-based vulnerability. The indicators were allocated weights by multi criteria analysis using analytical hierarchy process. The spatial extent of all of the selected indicators was mapped for the IWH region at a pixel resolution of 24 m and was integrated to find out the vulnerability for each pixel in a GIS environment. The study area was divided into 172 grids of size 0.5 degrees, equivalent to the grid size of available climatic projections, out of which 67 grids were identified as the forest grids. The grids that have at least 5% forest cover were designated as the forest grids and the vulnerability assessment was done only for these grids. The final representation of vulnerability across forested grids of the IWH was done at a spatial resolution of 5' and 0.5 degrees to categorise as low, medium, high and very high class. It was observed that the highest concentration of very high and high vulnerable grids of 5' size lies in the state of UK, comprising 32 and 31%, respectively. The aggregated values at 0.5 degrees indicate that most of the grids of UK fall under very high vulnerability except for the few uppermost and lowermost grids falling under other categories. In J&K, most of the 5' grids fall under low vulnerability (41%), while medium, high and very high categories are 27, 25 and 7%, respectively. Similarly, out of total 28 grids of size 0.5 degrees, only one grid is categorized as very high vulnerable, while 11 grids fall under high vulnerability. In HP, none of the grids of either size is categorized as very high vulnerable. It was observed that most of the high and very high vulnerable grids in the IWH are in the lower altitudes while higher altitudes have lesser magnitude of vulnerability. Forests occurring at a higher elevation such as the Alpine forests (dry, moist and sub-alpine) is the least vulnerable forests compared to other forest type groups of the IWH.","[Kumar, Manoj; Gupta, Ajay Kumar] Forest Res Inst FRI, GIS Ctr, PO New Forest, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India; [Kalra, Naveen] Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Agr Phys, New Delhi, India; [Singh, Hukum] Forest Res Inst, Forest Ecol & Climate Change Div, PO New Forest, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India; [Sharma, Subrat] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Ladakh Reg Ctr, Kosi Katarmal 263643, Almora, India; [Rawat, Praveen Singh] Forest Res Inst, Res & Coordinat Sect, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India; [Singh, Ram Kumar] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Dept Nat Resources, New Delhi, India; [Kumar, Pavan] Rani Lakshmi Bai Cent Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry, Jhansi 284003, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Ravindranath, N.

As a result, a number of studies have estimated glacier mass balance using different methods. Here, we have used the improved accumulation area-ratio (IAAR) method to study the mass balance of the Nehnar glacier from 2000 to 2020. This study also aims to study the spatiotemporal behavior and other dynamics of the glacier. Results have shown that the glacier has continuously lost its ice reserves throughout the studied period though at a lower rate since 2010. Its annual specific mass balance has changed from - 50.10 +/- 3 cm w.e in 2000 to - 59.46 +/- 3 cm w.e. in 2020. The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of the glacier rose by 90 m and has shifted from 4260 masl in 2000 to 4350 masl in 2020. The glacier has shrunk from an area of 1.64 km2 in 2000 to 1.38 km2 in 2020 losing nearly 16% of its area. The study highlights the need for continued monitoring of glacier mass balance to better understand and predict the effects of climate change. These findings have important implications for the future of glacier retreat and water reserves of the Jhelum basin.","[Bhat, Waseem Ahmmad; Bhat, Irshad Ahmad; Ahmed, Pervez; Rashid, Shahbaz] Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Geog & Disaster Management, Srinagar 190006, India; [Shafiq, Mifta Ul] Jammu & Kashmir Govt, Higher Educ Dept, Jammu, India",,"Bhat, WA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Geog & Disaster Management, Srinagar 190006, India.",Waseem.scholar@kashmiruniversity.net; pervezku@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2023,30.0,47,,,,,103463,103479,,10.1007/s11356-023-29714-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-29714-z,,SEP 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001067043200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, many of the wetlands remain understudied (like temperate, boreal, and high-altitude wetlands), which constrains the global budgets. Himalayan foothill is one such data-deficient area. The present study reported (for the first time) the greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4, N2O, and H2O vapor) from the soils of the Nakraunda wetland of Uttarakhand in India during the post-monsoon season (October 2020 to January 2021). The sampling points covered six different types of soil within the wetlands. CO2, CH4, N2O, and H2O vapor emissions ranged from 82.89 to 1052.13 mg m(-2) h(-1), 0.56 to 2.25 mg m(-2) h(-1), 0.18 to 0.40 mg m(-2) h(-1), and 557.96 to 29,397.18 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively, during the study period. Except for CO2, the other three greenhouse gas effluxes did not show any spatial variability. Soils close to swamp proper emitted substantially higher CO2 than the vegetated soils. Soil temperature exhibited exponential relationships with all the greenhouse gas fluxes, except for H2O vapor. The Q(10) values for CO2, CH4, and N2O varied from 3.42 to 4.90, 1.66 to 2.20, and 1.20 to 1.30, respectively. Soil moisture showed positive relationships with all the greenhouse gas fluxes, except for N2O. The fluxes observed from Nakraunda were in parity with global observations. However, this study showed that wetlands experiencing lower temperature regime are also capable of emitting a substantial amount of greenhouse gases and thus, requires more study. Considering the seasonality of greenhouse gas fluxes should improve global wetland emission budgets.","[Raturi, Asha; Singh, Hukum; Kumar, Parmanand; Shukla, Navneet] Forest Res Inst, Forest Ecol & Climate Change Div, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India; [Chanda, Abhra] Jadavpur Univ, Sch Oceanog Studies, Kolkata 7000032, W Bengal, India",,"Raturi, A (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst, Forest Ecol & Climate Change Div, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India.",asha.ashafri@gmail.com,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2022,194.0,2,,,,,,,50,10.1007/s10661-021-09721-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09721-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000738584900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results indicate that JJA precipitation over Upper Indus Basin (UIB which also includes North Pakistan) is projected to increase more under RCP8.5 and less under RCP2.6 while for Pakistan it shows slightly increase (decrease) in RCP2.6 (RCP8.5). The results also show a projected expansion in monsoon area in UIB and northward shift of MCR which corresponds with future precipitation changes in the area and hence indicate the penetration of monsoon system over UIB under higher warming scenario.

Using Aster GDEM2, we calculated swath elevation, 200m topographic relief, and average slope angle of a small-scale watershed in the middle Himalayan orogen. Based on the geological history of Gyirong and data on the Himalayan uplift process, this study analyzed the topographic characteristics of Gyirong watershed, discussed the relationships between landform and structure, lithology, and climate, and compared slope stability. The results showed that the topographic elevation characteristics retained correspondence to local basement forms and tectonic associations. Periodic spatial change at the summit level had a clear response to the structural distribution, and may support the theory that the Gyirong basin floor is a combination of normal and reverse faults. Average height increased at first and then stabilized, and these morphological characteristics and distribution patterns provide topographic evidence for the interpretation of tectonic uplift and erosional accumulation, which confirmed that 4000m was the vertical differentiation boundary for the tectonic landform. Although climate, landforms, tectonics, and lithology vary across different orogenic belts, the similar slope angle threshold provided the insight that erosion is the tectonic genesis to equilibrium of heterogeneous hillsides at different scales.","[Chen, Lu] Chengdu Normal Coll, Inst Humanity Resources Western China, Chengdu 611130, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Kan, Aike] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Geophys, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lu; Kan, Aike; Wang, Yingjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resource & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Kan, AK (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Geophys, Chengdu 610059, Sichuan, Peoples R China.;Kan, AK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resource & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",051052@cdnu.edu.cn; kanaike@qq.com; wangyj@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2019,14.0,2,,,,,473,482,,10.26471/cjees/2019/014/096,http://dx.doi.org/10.26471/cjees/2019/014/096,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000484879700020,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study was conducted to evaluate the major, trace element concentrations and environment risk assessment in the surface sediments of Anchar Lake. Spatial distribution of organic matter (OM), CaCO3, TOC, sand-silt-clay and C/N ratio was studied to understand their source and accumulation in recent surface sediments. Textural studies indicate that most of the sediment samples are clayey silt to silty clay except one sample being of sandy-clay-silt nature. OM, CaCO3 content and C/N ratio results reveal that the sediments are organically rich and the source of OM is controlled by both; autochthonous and terrestrial sources. The major oxide geochemistry reflects higher concentrations of CaO, MgO and TiO2 compared to the UCC values and the possible dilution effect of CaO on other major oxides. Environmental risk assessment indices (Igeo and EF) reveal that the lake surface sediments are low to moderately enriched with Cu, Ni, Zn and Pb and thus are a direct threat to aquatic life. Pollution load index indicates higher contamination of the sediment samples collected along the agricultural and urban land-cover sites. In the absence of industries and metal mines in the catchment area, the agricultural inputs, domestic effluents and untreated sewage discharges are the probable source for the moderate increase in trace metals in the lake sediments. Based on geochemical and environmental parameters, an assessment of sediment contamination results revealed potential risks ranging from moderate to strong for the lake environment, particularly towards areas proximal to agricultural and land-use sites. The above results from this study thus add to the fundamental knowledge of the present lake processes occurring within the lake and its interactions with the surrounding catchment areas.","[Lone, Aasif Mohmad; Shah, Rayees Ahmad; Achyuthan, Hema; Fousiya, A.

The study seeks to answer that how local people perceive climate change and its impact on their household income and to what extent value chain development of mountain products prove to be a potential strategy for building climate resilience among local people? This study contributes to the existing scholarship on climate adaptation by proposing non-conventional and innovative livelihood strategies for enhancing climate resilience of local communities in four valleys of northern Pakistan. The research relies on both primary and secondary data. A field survey was carried out to collect data from 443 households using a structured questionnaire. This study shows that the mountain communities consider climate-induced natural hazards as major causes of change in households' income. To enhance the socioeconomic resilience against these climate vulnerabilities, cultivating sea buckthorn, breeding yak and developing value chains for related products has been suggested. Breeding yaks are both less labor intensive and climate resilient. Products made from yak hair and dung have the potential for high return if their value chains are established. Likewise, sea buckthorn is also considered less labor intensive and insensitive to extreme weather conditions. It could generate by-products used for food, medicine, cosmetics and construction. In order to improve socioeconomic resilience of local communities and enhance their adaptive capacity against effects of climate change, a value chain approach for yak and sea-buckthorn products has been proposed.","[Baig, Saranjam M.] Karakorum Int Univ, Dept Econ, Gilgit, Pakistan; [Khan, Aftab A.] Karakorum Int Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Gilgit, Pakistan; [Ali, Amjad] Karakorum Int Univ Hunza Campus, Dept Dev Studies, Gilgit, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Zafar] Karakorum Int Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Gilgit, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Sultan] French Med Inst Mothers & Children FMIC, Kabul, Afghanistan; [Shah, Ghulam M.; Ali, Ghulam] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Lalitpur, Nepal",,"Ali, A (corresponding author), Karakorum Int Univ Hunza Campus, Dept Dev Studies, Gilgit, Pakistan.",saranjam.baig@kiu.edu.pk; aftab.ahmed@kiu.edu.pk; amjad.eco@kiu.edu.pk; zafar.khan@kiu.edu.pk; rajasultan.ahmed@gmail.com; GhulamMuhammad.Shah@icimod.org; Ghulam.Ali@icimod.org,,,,,,,,8.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2021,23.0,6,,,,,8451,8473,,10.1007/s10668-020-00975-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-00975-9,,SEP 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000568790600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is important to assess the magnitude of problem and to understand the erosion process under normal conditions, so that effective measures can be implemented. Therefore, the study selected Kalsa watershed from the Lesser Himalayan region, where soil erosion is more prominent. Regarding this issue, to identify the hot spot of soil erosion of the basin, watershed prioritization methods using advanced geographical information system and remote sensing techniques integrated with weighted sum analysis (WSA) and principal component analysis (PCA). In addition, a comparison has been made to evaluate the performance of these models. The study considered sixteen different morphometric parameters, including linear (rho coefficient, stream frequency, drainage density, length of overland flow, drainage texture and constant of channel maintenance); landscape (relative relief, relief ratio, basin slope and ruggedness number); and shape (elongation ratio, form factor, circulatory ratio and compactness coefficient). Both the methods PCA and WSA indicate the same results showing high priority, meaning the outlet watersheds have high priority. The sub-watersheds in the north-eastern part have the lowest priority. The results also show that the length overland flow, relative relief, basin relief ratio and hypsometric integral are the most important indicators. The sub-watersheds prioritize high ranks, medium ranks and low ranks out of 10 sub-watersheds covering about 45.32%, 27.78% and 26.90% area of the Kalsa River watershed, respectively.

However, the threat of invasion is likely to increase because of climate change, greater anthropogenic land use, and continuing novel introductions. Preventive management, therefore, will be crucial but can be difficult to promote when more pressing problems are unresolved and predictions are uncertain. In this essay, we use management case studies from 7 mountain regions to identify common lessons for effective preventive action. The degree of plant invasion in mountains was variable in the 7 regions as was the response to invasion, which ranged from lack of awareness by land managers of the potential impact in Chile and Kashmir to well-organized programs of prevention and containment in the United States (Hawaii and the Pacific Northwest), including prevention at low altitude. In Australia, awareness of the threat grew only after disruptive invasions. In South Africa, the economic benefits of removing alien plants are well recognized and funded in the form of employment programs. In the European Alps, there is little need for active management because no invasive species pose an immediate threat. From these case studies, we identify lessons for management of plant invasions in mountain ecosystems: (i) prevention is especially important in mountains because of their rugged terrain, where invasions can quickly become unmanageable; (ii) networks at local to global levels can assist with awareness raising and better prioritization of management actions; (iii) the economic importance of management should be identified and articulated; (iv) public acceptance of management programs will make them more effective; and (v) climate change needs to be considered. We suggest that comparisons of local case studies, such as those we have presented, have a pivotal place in the proactive solution of global change issues.","[McDougall, Keith L.] Off Environm & Heritage, Queanbeyan, NSW 2620, Australia; [Khuroo, Anzar A.; Reshi, Zafar A.] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Ctr Biodivers & Taxon, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Loope, Lloyd L.] US Geol Survey, Pacific Isl Ecosyst Res Ctr, Makawao, HI USA; [Parks, Catherine G.] US Forest Serv, Pacific NW Res Stn, La Grande, OR 97850 USA; [Pauchard, Anibal] Univ Concepcion, Fac Ciencias Forestales, Concepcion, Chile; [Pauchard, Anibal] Inst Ecol & Biodivers, Santiago, Chile; [Rushworth, Ian] Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, ZA-3202 Cascades, South Africa; [Kueffer, Christoph] ETH Zentrum, Inst Integrat Biol Plant Ecol, CHN, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",,"McDougall, KL (corresponding author), Off Environm & Heritage, POB 733, Queanbeyan, NSW 2620, Australia.",keith.mcdougall@environment.nsw.gov.au,,,,,,,,69.0,74.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2011,31.0,4,,,,,380,387,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00082.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00082.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000298349900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

While this is consistent with a changing climate, local topographic parameters, such as altitude, slope, aspect and debris cover, are also important influences. Recession is manifested by a rise in the elevation of the glacier terminus. The shrinkage of glaciers with NE, N and NW orientations exceeded that of other aspects, and glaciers with SE and S orientations experienced less shrinkage.

There was a significant increase in moisture content (21.13 +/- 1.51), organic carbon (2.65% +/- 0.52%), available nitrogen (493.790 +/- 2.105 kg/ha), and potassium (432.727 +/- 1.738 kg/ha) at undisturbed area Baerabal Harwan. However, there was a reduced pH (5.39 +/- 0.230) and available phosphorus (18.993 +/- 1.370) at undisturbed area in contrast to disturbed sites.

Daily, weekly, or monthly streamflows of non-monsoon periods are critical for about a billion people living in these perennial river basins for water supply, irrigation, hydropower, and other water needs. The streamflow in snow and glacier dominated watersheds are affected mainly by solar energy and temperature. The existing models for streamflow and snow depth estimation are tedious and lack reliability. The impact of climate change has further enhanced the uncertainty. The springtime streamflow for the study area has increased by 2% yearly due to changes in climate during the last 25 years. The paper describes a nomogram, which combines the effect of climate change, temperature, and melting snow depth to estimate the daily average flow/discharge during spring time for a subbasin in the Himalayas. The concept is simple and uses location-specific regressed weekly main temperature, snow depth and discharge during ablating snowpack. The analysis focused on 3 typical years (1983, 2003, and 2008) and an average of 5-6 years during the spring period. The results of the study indicate a shift in temperature trend over the years and identify critical temperatures influencing the rate of snowmelt. The use of the temperature trendline has improved the streamflow simulation and further adaptation of average conditions under the changing climate and human influences in the region has enhanced the predictability of snowmelt/runoff. The glacier melts mostly occur in the summer-monsoon season so this trend cannot be addressed here with the springtime data set. However, a similar nomogram can be prepared for the summer-monsoon season if there is a snow cover area (SCA) of more than 50%.

Here, we analyzed the characteristics of the glacier surface energy fluxes along with their contributions to glacier melt on Bayi Ice Cap in Qilian Mountains by using a point-scale energy balance model. The half-hourly meteorological data from an automatic weather station (AWS) located on the glacier was used to drive the energy balance model. The model simulated results could accurately represent the mass-balance observations from the stake near the weather station during summer 2016. Our results showed the net radiation (86%) played an important role in the surface energy balance, and the contribution of the turbulent heat fluxes (14%) to the energy budget was relatively less important. A distinct behavior of energy balance, as compared to other continental glaciers in China (e.g., two adjacent glaciers Laohugou No. 12 Glacier and Qiyi Glacier), is the fact that a sustained period of positive turbulent latent flux exists on Bayi Ice Cap during August, causing faster melt rate in the month of August.

The correct modeling of the contribution of the glaciers meltwater to the total runoff of the Tarim River is hampered by the lack of mass balance data. Multi-temporal digital terrain models (DTMs) allow the determination of volume changes for large samples of glacier. Here, we present the mass changes for 12 glaciers using 1976 KH-9 Hexagon, 2000 SRTM3 and 2009 SPOT-5 datasets. The results show that most of the glaciers have been losing mass since 1976. The largest glaciers, Koxkar and West Qongterang, lost -0.27+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) and -0.43+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) between 1976 and 2009, despite thick debris cover. However, some smaller glaciers show mass gain at their tongues indicating glacier surges. Using SRTM3 data the volume gain of Qinbingtan Glacier No. 74 could be dated to the time period 1999-2009. The overall mass budget of -0.33+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) (for 1976-2009) of the investigated glaciers is within the variability range of the global average. However, in the recent years (1999-2009) a slightly decelerated mass loss of -0.23+/-0.19 m w.e.a(-1) could be observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The in situ air temperature (T-a) observations require intense logistic and financial investments, making it sparse and fragmented particularly in remote and extreme environments. The temperatures in Himalaya are controlled by a complex system driven by topography, seasons, and cryosphere which further makes it difficult to record or predict its spatial heterogeneity. In this regard, finding a way to fill the observational spatiotemporal gaps in data becomes more crucial. Here, we show the comparison of T-a recorded at 11 high altitude stations in Western Himalaya with their respective land surface temperatures (T-s) recorded by Moderate Resolution Imagining Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra satellites in cloud-free conditions. We found remarkable seasonal and spatial trends in the T-a vs. T-s relationship: (i) T-s are strongly correlated with T-a (R-2 = 0.77, root mean square difference (RMSD) = 5.9 degrees C, n = 11,101 at daily scale and R-2 = 0.80, RMSD = 5.7 degrees C, n = 3552 at 8-day scale); (ii) in general, the RMSD is lower for the winter months in comparison to summer months for all the stations, (iii) the RMSD is directly proportional to the elevations; (iv) the RMSD is inversely proportional to the annual precipitation. Our results demonstrate the statistically strong and previously unreported T-a vs. T-s relationship and spatial and seasonal variations in its intensity at daily resolution for the Western Himalaya. We anticipate that our results will provide the scientists in Himalaya or similar data-deficient extreme environments with an option to use freely available remotely observed T-s products in their models to fill-up the spatiotemporal data gaps related to in situ monitoring at daily resolution. Substituting T-a by T-s as input in various geophysical models can even improve the model accuracy as using spatially continuous satellite derived T-s in place of discrete in situ T-a extrapolated to different elevations using a constant lapse rate can provide more realistic estimates.","[Singh, Shaktiman; Bhardwaj, Anshuman; Sam, Lydia; Javier Martin-Torres, F.; Zorzano, Maria-Paz] Lulea Univ Technol, Div Space Technol, Dept Comp Sci Elect & Space Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Singh, Atar] Sharda Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Greater Noida 201310, India; [Shekhar, Mayank] Birbal Sahni Inst Palaeosci, Lucknow 226007, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Javier Martin-Torres, F.] Inst Andaluz Ciencias Tierra CSIC UGR, Granada 18100, Spain; [Zorzano, Maria-Paz] Ctr Astrobiol INTA CSIC, Madrid 28850, Spain",,"Singh, S (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Div Space Technol, Dept Comp Sci Elect & Space Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",shaktiman.singh@ltu.se; anshuman.bhardwaj@ltu.se; 2015002854atar@dr.sharda.ac.in; lydia.sam@ltu.se; mayank_shekhar@bsip.res.in; javier.martin-torres@ltu.se; zorzanomm@cab.inta-csic.es,,,,,,,,12.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 2,2019,11.0,24,,,,,,,2889,10.3390/rs11242889,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11242889,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000507333400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The basic aim was to identify the drivers responsible for wetland degradation in order to sustain ecosystem services effectively. To achieve this, we examined water quality, trophic status, fish species diversity and human disturbances by analyzing changes in land use and land cover (LULC) since 1980. For the limnological characterization of the two wetlands, we evaluated a total of 21 physico-chemical parameters at 24 sites. Two-way analysis of variance revealed significant (p < 0.05) spatial and temporal variability in the water quality parameters. The trophic state index values of 67.7 and 76.7 indicated that the rural and urban wetlands were in eutrophic and hypertrophic status, respectively, signifying potential environmental stress. The data on fish fauna indicated a decline in fish species over the past 40 years, particularly the schizothoracine species. Urban wetlands showed a more significant decrease in species (06) compared to rural wetlands (01). LULC mapping and change analysis employing the visual interpretation technique showed significant transformations in the immediate catchment of wetlands. Substantial growth in the built-up (433.2 % and 2620 %) and decrease in aquatic vegetation (-83.4 % and -97.5 %) in the immediate catchment was recorded in both the urban and rural wetlands respectively from 1980 to 2020. Our findings demonstrated a relationship between LULC classes and water quality parameters, with an increase in built-up and road areas showing a significant positive correlation with the rise in decadal mean values of total phosphorus, orthophosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, ammonical nitrogen, and calcium content. Based on these observations, we concluded that changes in land use and land cover within the immediate catchment areas of the wetlands were the primary drivers responsible for the deterioration of wetland ecosystem health.","[Javaid, Maheen; Shafi, Aurooj; Hamid, Aadil; Jehangir, Arshid; Yousuf, A.

This paper investigates the association of LSWT with meteorological parameters and its impact during El Nino and La Nina events over the Himalayan lake region, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data from 2001 to 2017. The observed daytime rates of change of LSWT was -0.05 degrees C/year whereas it was +0.01 degrees C/year for nighttime. The cooling of lake during daytime could be attributed to increase in rainfall and decrease in solar radiation, whereas increase in nighttime LSWT is due to increasing lowest temperature. The variability in LSWT with respect to meteorological variables during El Nino Southern Oscillation period was highest for cold phase than warm phase. There was only 1% increase in LSWT in the El Nino years (2002 and 2009), due to decreased rainfall by 95% and 56% respectively. On the other hand, the LSWT decreased in strong La Nina years of 2007 (2%) and 2010 (6%) due to the drastically increased rainfall, decreased maximum temperature and solar radiation. The correlation revealed that, in addition to the increase in temperature, the LSWT warming is consistent with the decrease in rainfall and increase in solar radiation.","[Mushtaq, Fayma; Ahmed, Pervez] Univ Kashmir, Dept Geog & Reg Dev, Srinagar, India; [Lala, Mili Ghosh Nee] Birla Inst Technol Mesra, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi, Bihar, India",,"Mushtaq, F (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Geog & Reg Dev, Srinagar, India.",fayma.scholar@kashmiruniversity.net,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 4,2021,42.0,3,,,,,240,264,,10.1080/02723646.2020.1751386,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.2020.1751386,,APR 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000528169200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, mapping these soils in digital soil mapping technique encounters several challenges, including high local variability, non-linear relationships between environmental covariates and soil properties, limited accessibility in complex topographical settings, and the absence of universally applicable covariates for soil formation. To address these issues, this study integrates soil-forming factors of the scorpan model to map soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil texture in the mid-Himalayas. By considering over 100 environmental covariates, with a focus on terrain parameters relevant to mountainous environments, the study aims to enhance the accuracy of ML regression models through augmentation techniques that overcome data insufficiency. Using augmented soil observations and covariates, a non-parametric random forest regression model is trained and applied to predict soil variables across the study area, generating a continuous fine-resolution map. The model's performance, evaluated against an unknown dataset, was significant with an R-square of 0.80, 0.79, 0.72, and 0.84 for clay, sand, silt, and SOC, respectively. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of the environmental covariates and their impact on the model revealed that all the soil-forming factors make a significant contribution to the model's effectiveness. The insights gained from this research contribute to a better understanding of mountain soils and facilitate the development of effective conservation and sustainable management strategies for mountainous regions.","[Rengma, Nyenshu Seb; Yadav, Manohar] Motilal Nehru Natl Inst Technol Allahabad, Geog Informat Syst GIS Cell, Prayagraj 211004, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Kalambukattu, Justin George; Kumar, Suresh] Indian Space Res Org Govt India, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Agr & Soils Dept, 4, Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttaranchal, India",,"Yadav, M (corresponding author), Motilal Nehru Natl Inst Technol Allahabad, Geog Informat Syst GIS Cell, Prayagraj 211004, Uttar Pradesh, India.",nyneshu@gmail.com; ssmyadav@mnnit.ac.in; justinagri@gmail.com; suresh_kumar@iirs.gov.in,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2023,195.0,8,,,,,,,994,10.1007/s10661-023-11608-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11608-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001035585100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Hunza basin in Pakistan contains very large glacier systems, which, given the melt, cannot persist unless precipitation (snow input) is much higher than what is observed at the meteorological stations, mostly located in mountain valleys. Several studies, therefore, suggest strong positive vertical precipitation lapse rates; in the present study, we quantify this lapse rate by using glaciers as a proxy. We assume a neutral mass balance for the glaciers for the period from 2001 to 2003, and we inversely model the precipitation lapse by balancing the total accumulation in the catchment area and the ablation over the glacier area for the 50 largest glacier systems in the Hunza basin in the Karakoram. Our results reveal a vertical precipitation lapse rate that equals 0.216 +/- 0.12% m(-1), with a maximum precipitation at an elevation of 5500 masl. We showed that the total annual basin precipitation (828 mm) is 260% higher than what is estimated based on interpolated observations (319 mm); this has major consequences for hydrological modeling and water resource assessments in general. Our results were validated by using previously published studies on individual glaciers as well as the water balance of the Hunza basin. The approach is more widely applicable in mountain ranges where precipitation measurements at high altitude are lacking.","[Immerzeel, Walter Willem] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Immerzeel, Walter Willem; Pellicciotti, Francesca] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn Hydrol & Water Resources Manag, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Shrestha, Arun B.] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, ICIMOD, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Immerzeel, WW (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, POB 80115, Utrecht, Netherlands.",w.w.immerzeel@uu.nl,,,,,,,,89.0,98.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2012,32.0,1,,,,,30,38,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00097.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00097.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000301505500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study was conducted in north western Himalaya, and different fractions of nitrogen, viz., available nitrogen, total nitrogen, ammonical nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen, were estimated with reference to different parameters. Annual retention potential was evaluated among various fractions, which yielded positive results, with Site 1 demonstrating the highest retention potential across all seasons. At various depths and seasons of the year, ammonical and nitrate nitrogen levels fluctuated. The findings revealed that the soil is rich in nitrogen fractions with variation directly related to changes in carbon dioxide concentration. Site 1 had the highest values of all the fractions and Site 4 the lowest, whereas the C/N ratio varied between sites. The study determined that nitrogen fractions were present in sufficient quantities and play an important role in the maintenance and growth of natural forests as well as in the reduction of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.","[Sheikh, Muzamil Ahmad; Anjum, Jasra; Tiwari, Avinash] Jiwaji Univ, Sch Studies Bot, Gwalior, India",,"Sheikh, MA (corresponding author), Jiwaji Univ, Sch Studies Bot, Gwalior, India.",muzamiljabbar11@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2022,194.0,7,,,,,,,477,10.1007/s10661-022-10145-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10145-1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000805935600004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Five measurements were performed on the Ningchan No. 1 (NC01) glacier in the Qilian Mountains between 18 August 2017 and 13 August 2020. The glacier changes displayed in the digital orthophoto maps (DOMs) and digital surface models (DSMs) show a 7.4 +/- 0.1 m a(-1) retreat of the terminus of NC01, a mass balance of -1.22 +/- 0.1 m w.e. a(-1) from 2017 to 2020, and a maximum surface velocity of 3.2 +/- 0.47 m from 18 August 2017 to 26 August 2018, which clearly show consistency with stake measurements.

This region is distinctive in terms of high forest cover and rich biodiversity, but also features increasing human population, agricultural practices, and subsequent human-wildlife conflict. This study evaluated the impact of anthropogenic and agricultural proliferation on land use and land cover (LULC) transition dynamics of a forest and its surrounding area of this region. Jaldapara National Park along with its neighbouring region represents an ideal example of such ecology and thus was chosen as the study area. Satellite remote sensing was used to overcome accessibility issues in areas of protected forest and model future possible LULC of the area. Results indicated a continuous decrease in dense forest from 1978 to 2016. Modelling predicted a continuation of the same trend through 2050. The total area under forest increased from 1978 to 2001, possibly due to declaration of a part of the forest as a wildlife sanctuary in 1976 and subsequent increase in supervision and surveillance. However, total forest area started to decline from 2001 and future reductions are possible. Cultivated lands increased from 1978 to 2016 and additional future increase is likely due to a commensurate surge in human population in areas adjacent to the forest. In sum, increasing population pressure, agricultural production demands, and high human intervention in forest ecology were identified as possible causes of temporal forest degradation.

The prevalence was estimated based on the results of microorganism culture. Results: The overall prevalence of heifer mastitis was 90.80% by cultural examination whereas only 30% of the animals produced clinical signs. The prevalence was higher in organized management system and prime risk factors associated with mastitis were season of calving, prepartum intramammary infections, poor udder hygiene, etc., in both organized and unorganized managements. Interpretation: High prevalence of heifer mastitis (as evidenced by presence of microorganisms) is alarming situation for dairy farming in India. Season of calving, milk leakage at calving, prepartum IMI, poor udder hygiene, sanitation, beddings, floor type, and contact of heifers with older cows could be the important risk factors.","[Kour, S.; Sharma, N.; Huma, Z.

Samples were analyzed for assessment of physico-chemical properties at four soil depths, viz., 0-15, 15-30, 30-45, and 45-60 cm. A total of 120 soil samples were collected in both the seasons. Soil texture was found to be sandy loam and slightly alkaline in nature. The relative trend of soil organic carbon (SOC), macro- and micro-nutrient content for the five LUSs was forest > orchard > grassland > wheat-rice > sugarcane, in the pre- and post-monsoon seasons. SOC was highly correlated with macronutrients and micronutrients, whereas SOC was negatively correlated with soil pH (r = -0.818). The surface soil layer (0-15 cm) had a significantly higher content of SOC, and macro- and micro-nutrients compared to the sub-surface soil layers, due to the presence of more organic content in the soil surface layer. Tukey's multiple comparison test was applied to assess significant difference (p < 0.05) among the five LUSs at four soil depths in both the seasons. Principle component analysis (PCA) identified that SOC and electrical conductivity (EC) were the most contributing soil indicators among the different land use systems, and that the post-monsoon season had better soil quality compared to the pre-monsoon season.

Analysis on the climatic data of stations for 36-41 years between 1975 and 2016 showed significant increases in the minimum temperature in lower tropical climatic region (<500 m), upper tropical to subtropical climatic region (500-2000 m) and temperate climatic region (2000-3000 m) by 0.01, 0.026 and 0.054 degrees C/year, respectively, and an increase of maximum temperature by 0.008, 0.018, and 0.019 degrees C/year, respectively. Rainfall showed a strongly significant decreasing trend in all elevation regions. This result matches with the views of respondents except 38% respondent from temperate climatic region. People from the temperate climatic region also mentioned that current onset of snowfall is delayed but amount of snowfall remained the same. From the documented records, except events of wild fire, frequency of natural disasters events have increased in the recent years, which was in harmony with the views of local people. Multi-linear regression analysis showed that contribution of climatic variables on finger millet yield in lower tropical climatic region and upper tropical to subtropical regions was 23% and 57.3%, respectively, which was supported by increasing trend on average growing degree day (GDD) temperature at the rate of 0.01 degrees C in upper tropical to subtropical region and 0.007 degrees C in lower tropical climatic region yearly.

Digital elevation models (DEMs) are an important input for hydrological models. At times, DEM grid size needs to be altered for hydrological simulation in large basins. Therefore, appropriate grid sizes need to be investigated for modeling of hydrological variables. Many studies have investigated the effect of DEM grid size on flow and nutrient modeling. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no one has attempted to understand the uncertainties in SWAT model outputs due to DEM grid size and resampling methods over large, snow-affected, mountainous river basins. In this study, the Gandak River Basin, a large snow-covered river basin in the Himalayas, was examined at monthly and annual time steps using 40-1,000-m grid sizes resampled with nearest neighborhood, bilinear, and cubic convolution methods. Results showed that sediment and flow are greatly affected by DEM resolutions and by the choice of resampling method. Flow and sediment are overestimated for DEM grid sizes > 300 and > 150 m, respectively. However, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) change at DEM grid sizes of >= 150 m via slope and volume of flow. T-test statistics indicate the significance of changes in SWAT outputs due to DEM resolution and resampling. They are significant for SWAT outputs at > 500-m grid sizes at a yearly time step. Results also showed significant increases in relative difference (RD) with changes in DEM grid size during snowmelt periods, which indicates changes in the SWAT snowmelt parameter due to the resampled DEM. The proposed results can be applied to flow and nutrient modeling over any snow-affected, large, mountainous river basin.

Lake bottom sediments collected from Anchar Lake were investigated to trace the magnetic and heavy metal signatures in context to quantify the environmental conditions from one of the ideal setup of lake catchment in the Srinagar valley of Kashmir Himalaya. Magnetic parameters such as chi(ARM), SIRM and Soft(IRM) revealed predominant soft ferrimagnetic mineralogy. The S-ratio showing a mean value of - 0.69 within a range of - 0.77 to - 0.57 depicted majority of PSD-SD ferrimagnetic grains. The chi(lf) versus chi(fd) % biplot suggest the presence of mixture of SP and coarser magnetic grains controlling the magnetic susceptibility signals in the lake bottom sediments. The magnetic parameters and heavy metal constituents in particular S-ratio, SIRM/chi(lf), chi(ARM)/chi(lf) and chi(ARM) exhibit significant correlation with Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn. Furthermore, spatial variability of these parameters depicts a complex of detritus influx, anthropogenic inputs, and the domain size of minerals reflecting oxidizing and reducing conditions with sharp changes in the peripheral part and gradual mixing towards the central and deeper parts of the lake basin. Multivariate statistical analyses (Pearson correlation, cluster and factor analyses) attest direct relation of the heavy metals with mineral magnetic assemblages.

Among the valuable plant species that grow in this region, Paeonia emodi (family Paeoniaceae) is an important wild edible species that found in temperate regions with an altitude range between 1800 and 2800 m. The species is facing a severe threat to its sustainability due to overharvesting, habitat disturbances, and a lack of effort regarding conservation. For the first time, this study investigated anthropogenic pressure, population decline perceptions in the natural habitat, and vulnerability assessment of P. emodi under selected study sites (n=23 villages). A semi structured questionnaire was used to interview approximately 45% of the local inhabitants, including herbal practitioners (Vaidhyas or Dais) of each village. On the basis of demographic characteristics, the perceptions and responses of 464 local people were documented regarding potential causes of deterioration and feasible options for sustainable utilization. Using the weight survey method, we estimated the actual amount of collection based on personal interaction and direct observation. In order to determine the threats status, a rapid vulnerability assessment (RVA) was performed and were used based on the current exploitation and usage. The present study revealed that leaf (100%) was the most frequently harvested part, followed by stem (95.65%), seed (26.09%), root (21.74%) and flower (13.04%). The village Triyuginarayan and Pothivasa recorded the highest collection scores while the purpose of the collection was mostly edible (100%), medicinal (100%), and least commercial (8.70%). According to the literature review and the present survey, the RVA (total = 21) is categorized as category II (intermediate side of the RVA index), indicating a degree of vulnerability. The study revealed that P. emodi faces extinction in the Garhwal Himalayas. Growing this species through agro-production techniques may alleviate the pressure on the existing population as a result of the availability of raw materials for commercial and household uses. These findings will provide an effective framework for conservation and management decisions and plans.","[Joshi, Praveen; Prakash, Prem] Govt MBG Coll, Dept Bot, Haldwani 263641, India; [Purohit, Vijay Kant] HNB Garhwal Cent Univ, High Altitude Plant Physiol Res Ctr, Srinagar 263671, India",,"Joshi, P (corresponding author), Govt MBG Coll, Dept Bot, Haldwani 263641, India.",praveenjoshipj88@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2023,20.0,3,,,,,810,820,,10.1007/s11629-022-7551-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-022-7551-y,,MAR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000947171400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The arid to semiarid basin is classified as a net water deficit area, but it also suffers from devastating floods. Among the four basin countries, Pakistan is most dependent on water originating in high mountain catchments and is therefore most vulnerable to climatic, socioeconomic, and other global changes that are impacting both supply and demand. Given the consensus that there is a lack of systematic and consistent hydrological, meteorological, biophysical, and socioeconomic data to promote integrated water resources management (IWRM) at the basin scale, an international consultation of scientists, water managers, and development partners was organized in 2010. These experts suggested developing a long-term Indus Basin Research Program aiming to build a robust, consolidated, and shared scientific knowledge base and thus improve understanding of the coupled human and ecological processes and their interrelationships in the basin. This paper summarizes the rationale for initiating such a coordinated multidisciplinary research, knowledge management, and capacity development process aiming to support water management policies and programs from design stage to implementation, using the framework of integrated river basin management (IRBM). The paper further stresses the need to implement IRBM using IWRM tools, recognizing that multiple factors and actors play critical roles in improving management of water and other natural resources to enhance overall water productivity. The steps needed to initiate and consolidate national and international institutional coordination, capacity development, and policy support to operationalize an IRBM process are spelled out. A long-term research and capacity-building program for international organizations and scientists is recommended to foster transboundary cooperation and scientific collaboration.","[Karki, Madhav Bahadur; Shrestha, Arun Bhakta] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Winiger, Matthias] Univ Bonn, Dept Geog, D-53115 Bonn, Germany",,"Karki, MB (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.",mkarki@icimod.org,,,,,,,,30.0,32.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2011,31.0,3,,,,,242,251,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00017.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00017.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000294947400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

These SLCPs also have detrimental impacts on human health and agriculture. Studies show that the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, which includes Nepal, has been experiencing the impacts of these pollutants in addition to greenhouse gases. In this study, we derive a national-level emission inventory for SLCPs, CO2, and air pollutants for Nepal and project their impacts under reference (REF) and mitigation policy (POL) scenarios. The impacts on human health, agriculture, and climate were then estimated by applying the following: (1) adjoint coefficients from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-chemical transport model that quantify the sensitivity of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and surface O-3 concentrations in Nepal, and radiative forcing in four latitudinal bands, to emissions in 2 x 2.5 degrees grids, and (2) concentration-response functions to estimate health and crop loss impacts in Nepal. With the mitigating measures undertaken, emission reductions of about 78% each of BC and CH4 and 87% of PM2.5 could be achieved in 2050 compared with the REF scenario. This would lead to an estimated avoidance of 29,000 lives lost and 1.7 million tonnes of crop loss while bringing an economic benefit in present value of 2.7 times more than the total cost incurred in its implementation during the whole period 2010-2050.

The study examined the spatial distribution of heavy metals like Fe, Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu, Mn, Co, Al, Ni, and Cr, through contour maps and observed overall low in two different seasons of six different watersheds. There is no significant variation between the means of Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Al, Cd, Mn, Ni, Zn and Pb as the value of p is greater than 0.05 which is attributed to different geochemical and hydrochemical setup. Groundwater samples of these watersheds were evaluated by different indices like WQI, EWQI, HMPI, HMEI, HQ, HI, ILCR, CDIoral, and CDIdermal for health risk assessment as well as to determine its suitability for drinking purposes. The water quality index (WQI) indicated that all of the samples (100%) were fit for drinking purposes. The EWQI was quite low, indicating that the water was of high quality for drinking. Health quotient (HQ(oral)) values and the health quotient (HQ(dermal)) values were < 1 signaling no potential non-carcinogenic health risk. Notwithstanding the above, an assessment of the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) revealed that individuals residing in the area may face potential cancer risks in the future through both oral and dermal pathways. This is due to the situation that ingestion of groundwater contaminated with Cd over a lifetime could result in a potential cancer risk of 5 individuals per every 10(6) people in the long term, which can be a significant cause for concern.","[Shah, Rameez A.; Shafi, Aurooj; Bhat, Sami Ullah] Univ Kashmir, Dept Environm Sci, Srinagar 190006, India; [Andrabi, S.

Hence, any change in the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the Himalayan tributaries of River Ganga under the changing climatic scenario will impact the hydrochemical parameters of River Ganga as well. Hydrochemical investigations have been carried out in the River Alaknanda, a tributary of River Ganga during the period September 2016-May 2018 and revealed that TSS and COD values were observed above the prescribed criteria limit of 10 mg/L for drinking purpose for river as prescribed by CPCB. The anions for all sampling sites and seasons were observed to be in decreasing order of HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3- and cations Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+. The weathering of rock forming minerals of drainage basin is responsible for the chemical composition of river water. HCO3- being the dominant anion in the study area accounts for its presence due to carbonate and silicate weathering. Ion exchange process controls the major ion chemistry of the river water. The assessment and management of non-point sources (NPS) pollution are difficult by any deterministic method and require a vast amount of data to compensate for their extent of contamination, in the account of their prevailing nature in response to hydrological processes and land use patterns. In the present investigation, the application of a simple chemical mass balance approach based on law of conservation of mass/matter has been applied on River Alaknanda, a tributary of River Ganga for measuring the chemical mass loadings of some selected water quality constituents, viz., major cations (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and ammonium) and major anions (chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate) at upstream and downstream of different point source locations for examining the contribution made by non-point sources of pollution to the river. Time series analysis of various ion concentrations at point source sites and upstream/downstream sites inferred that the fluvial variations pertaining to ion concentration and flux are strongly dependent on the seasonal changes. More contribution (> 30-50%) for almost all constituents from uncharacterized sources was observed in the months of November to February, which may be attributed to intensified agricultural activities during the winter months particularly cereals and vegetables.","[Sharma, M.

Yet, centres of neo-and paleo-endemism in mega-biodiversity China are controversial as their environmental features are unclear. Here, we used a comprehen-sive species occurrence dataset (4509 woody endemics with 158,028 occurrences) and phylogenetic approach categorical analyses of neo-and paleo-endemism (CANAPE) to identify endemic centres of woody flora in China. A total of 22 major and several minor centres of endemism have been successfully identified, covering 13.36 % of China's total land area, yet capturing 89.60 % of woody endemics. They were roughly in accordance with the previously known centres of endemism. New areas with conservation importance such as northern Xinjiang, eastern Heilongjiang, and western Himalayas were identified. Different centres of endemism presented their preferred environmental features. Centres of neo-endemism were associated with higher elevation, concentrated in central-southeastern Himalaya, southwestern Hengduan (evolutionary front) and the northern Altai Mountains. In contrast, centres of paleo-endemism preferred favorable climates (high temperature and precip-itation) and long-term climate stability. They were concentrated in southernmost China, in coincidence with one of the world's biodiversity hotspots (Indo-Burma). Centres of mixed-endemism were regarded as a transition type of neo-and paleo-endemism, concentrated in areas with moderate temperature and precipitation. Therefore, highlighting those centres of paleo-endemism should be considered as conservation priority areas due to dominating by old lineages with important evolutionary history and vulnerability to global drought.","[Wang, Qing; Huang, Jihong; Zang, Runguo] Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Chinese Acad Forestry, Key Lab Biodivers Conservat, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm,Ecol & Nat Conserva, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qing; Huang, Jihong; Zang, Runguo] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coinnovat Ctr Sustainable Forestry Southern China, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhenping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [El-Kassaby, Yousry A.] Univ British Columbia, Fac Forestry, Dept Forest & Conservat Sci, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada",,"Huang, JH (corresponding author), Natl Forestry & Grassland Adm, Chinese Acad Forestry, Key Lab Biodivers Conservat, Key Lab Forest Ecol & Environm,Ecol & Nat Conserva, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",qing.wang@alumni.ubc.ca; northalluvion@caf.ac.cn; zangrung@caf.ac.cn; lizhenping18@mails.ucas.ac.cn; y.el-kassaby@ubc.ca,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2022,276.0,,,,,,,,109817,10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109817,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2022.109817,,NOV 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000890316100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

We assessed the impact of various forest management regimes (FMRs): legal felling series [(reserve forest (RF), demarcated protected forest (DPF), un-demarcated protected forest (UPF), co-operative society forest (CSF) and un-classed forest (UF)] on biodiversity conservations and carbon storage in Acacia catechu Willd. Dominated northern tropical dry deciduous forest ecosystems in Nurpur Forest Division of north-western Himalaya, India. The study revealed significant variations in floristic composition, biodiversity indices, population structure and C storage potential among different forest management regimes. The RF and DPF were found to be rich in species diversity and richness whereas the Simpson dominance index for trees and shrubs was maximum in UF and UPF, respectively. The diversity of understory herbs were higher in CSF and UF. The maximum density of seedlings, saplings and poles were recorded in RF followed by DPF and UPF, whereas the minimum density was found in CSF. The tree C density (69.15 Mg C ha(-1)) was maximum in UF closely followed by RF; whereas the minimum was recorded in CSF (33.27 Mg C ha(-1)). The soil C density was maximum in RF (115.49 Mg C ha(-1)) and minimum in CSF (90.28 Mg C ha(-1)).

It impacts the composition, functioning, and structure of the forest ecosystem. Demographic pressure and the related climatic factors are thought to exacerbate the danger of forest fires, although there is a lack of statistical data to support this, particularly in South Asian countries with limited historical records. The study looks at how forest fires interact with their causative variables, such as population, topography, vegetation, and climate regimes, in the forests of Northern India. In order to do so, the paper presents a 15-year trend analysis of forest burn scars. This investigation confirmed the utility of principal component analysis using multisource spatial data and correlation matrices. The findings reveal that the occurrence and intensity of forest fires in mountainous locations are influenced by anthropogenic activities, forests near roads and settlements are extremely vulnerable. Based on the analysis, we emphasize the need for restructuring the existing policies like National Action Plan for forest fires and forest fire prevention and management scheme into more practical science-based policies. These findings may be utilized in planning effective fire control processes in time, and the technique provided in this study may be used to discover potential fire-risk zones in other areas.","[Ahmad, Laraib] Indian Space Res Org, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, India; [Ahmad, Laraib] Forest Res Inst FRI, PO New Forest, Dehra Dun 248006, India; [Saran, Sameer] ISRO, NRSC, Reg Remote Sensing Ctr North, New Delhi 110049, India",,"Ahmad, L (corresponding author), Indian Space Res Org, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, India.;Ahmad, L (corresponding author), Forest Res Inst FRI, PO New Forest, Dehra Dun 248006, India.",laraib00@gmail.com; sameer_s@nrsc.gov.in,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,2023 MAY 10,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10668-023-03312-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-03312-y,,MAY 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000985394100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

A 27-year period of study has been selected from 1990 to 2017, the main focus being to characterize these forces and link them with the statistics obtained from remotely sensed data. The cause and effect relationship between various indicators of land use change were analyzed using Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) assessment framework. This framework was applied to have a comprehensive view of interactions between human society and the environment. The goal has been achieved by using satellite based data, questionnaire based survey and an in depth analysis of data obtained from various secondary sources. The study finds out the major land use changes occur in a few selected classes, with cropland agriculture losing the most (-5%) whereas economically fruitful horticulture gaining the most (+4.29%) during the study period. The LULC changes have been driven by various forces ranging from natural, demographic and economic resulting in pressures on land and having various environmental ramifications and ultimately focus on responses.

The dominant land uses in the region including natural forest, degraded forest, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations, Areca catechu plantations, Areca agroforestry and Piper agroforestry were considered for the study. A progressive shift in land use was defined as the conversion and restoration of a less productive system like degraded land to plantations or agroforestry systems. A land use shift was considered retrogressive when it entails the establishment of plantations after clearing natural forests or anthropogenic disturbance of natural forests resulting in forest degradation. The objectives of the current study were to estimate changes in soil properties, stand structure, tree biomass, fine root production and carbon storage following a progressive and retrogressive shift in land usage. The aboveground biomass (105.9 Mg ha-1) was highest in the natural forest, followed by Areca agroforestry (100.2 Mg ha-1) and least in the degraded forest (55.3 Mg ha-1). The above-ground biomass carbon (47.1 Mg ha-1) of Areca agroforestry was comparable with that of natural forest (51.3 Mg ha-1). The highest proportion of passive carbon concentrations was observed under Areca agroforestry, whereas the lowest (4.13 g kg-1) was found under Areca plantations in the 0-25 cm soil depth. With the pro-gressive shift in land use from degraded forest to agroforestry, SOC stocks increased by 27.6 % and 3 % under Piper and Areca agroforests, respectively. SOC stocks decreased by 8.5 % with a shift in land use from natural forests to Areca plantations. The production of fine roots was maximum in the Areca agroforest (13.2 Mg ha-1) and lowest under rubber plantations (4.2 Mg ha-1). The results show that progressive shifts from degraded forest to agroforestry can considerably increase carbon stocks, plant species diversity and multifunctionality than shifts to monoculture plantations thereby supporting improved biodiversity and mitigation of climate change.","[Kurmi, Bandana; Nath, Arun Jyoti; Das, Ashesh Kumar] Assam Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Silchar, India; [Sileshi, Gudeta W.] Addis Ababa Univ, Dept Plant Biol & Biodivers Management, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; [Pandey, Rajiv] Indian Council Forestry Res & Educ, Dehra Dun, India",,"Nath, AJ (corresponding author), Assam Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Silchar, India.",arun.jyoti.nath@aus.ac.in,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 20,2024,912.0,,,,,,,,169197,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169197,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169197,,DEC 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001142223800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is estimated that the massive rockslide of similar to 23 million cubic meter volume containing base rock, deposited ice, and snow got detached from the northern slopes of the Trishul mountain range near Ronti Glacier and created a vertical fall of almost 1700 m before severely impacting the Ronti Gad valley located at 1.5 km downstream of Ronti Glacier snout. The huge detached mass of rock and ice (GLIMS ID: G079733E30381N) swiftly moved downstream through the glaciated valley entraining snow, debris, mud on its way, caused rapid fluidization, created massive water/slush waves, and washed away partially or completely the hydel power projects and bridges in its route. It is estimated that similar to 0.93 Peta Joules of potential energy led to the generation of a significant amount of kinetic and thermal energy, good enough to trigger above-mentioned processes. Post-event analysis of high-resolution satellite data shows flood water marks in the valley and on the rock outcrops reaching up to similar to 80-150 m height on the way to Raini Village. The mud and the slush produced through this process led to the formation of a dammed lake and temporarily blocked one of the tributaries of the Rishiganga joining from the northeast. This study provides an insight into the sequence of events as they unfolded, through multi-temporal satellite image analysis, aerial survey, seismological data in conjunction with various other geo-spatial and geo-visualization tools for unraveling the flood event that has happened on February 7, 2021.

The study highlights the diverse existing and emerging roles of different stakeholders, the complex relationships between them, and the power dynamics that influence the management of springsheds. The study (1) identified some new but missing actors/actor groups that were critical to managing springs; (2) showed that although state governments continue to play a dominant role, decision making is shifting to non-state and local actors; and (3) highlighted the importance of exchanging knowledge and information in implementing a policy more effectively. Understanding the characteristics of the governance network helped in drawing lessons to make the plan more sustainable and replicable, which include considering the policy in the wider context of policies for other sectors such as sanitation and hydropower development, incentivising the emerging actors, and building a stronger interdisciplinary and inclusive knowledge network. Such an integrated approach to policymaking can also be adopted to analyze governance networks related to natural resources other than water.","[Sen, Sudeshna Maya; Singh, Aprajita; Sharma, Divya; Kansal, Arun] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Coca Cola Dept Reg Water Studies, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India; [Varma, Navarun] India Habitat Ctr, Energy & Resources Inst, Earth Sci & Climate Change Div, Ctr Global Environm Res, Lodhi Rd, New Delhi 110003, India",,"Kansal, A (corresponding author), TERI Sch Adv Studies, Coca Cola Dept Reg Water Studies, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India.",akansal37@gmail.com,,,,,,,,8.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2019,63.0,2,,,,,233,248,,10.1007/s00267-018-1128-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-018-1128-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000458423900006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study we analyzed population characteristics and leaf traits of Rhododendron campanulatum across treeline ecotone in a trans-Himalayan region of Mustang district in central Nepal. Along 4 vertical transects, a total of 72 quadrats (5 m 5 m) - 34 above Betula utilis treeline and 38 below treeline - were sampled to analyze the population structure, regeneration, specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf-stem relationship of R. campanulatum. Our results showed that the regeneration of R. campanulatum was fairly good in both habitats, as evident from density-diameter curve. The species showed type III survivorship curve in both habitats with the highest mortality during early stage of life. However, the seedling density and mortality was higher below treeline than above treeline. Canopy cover and basal cover were found to be the major factors affecting regeneration, as indicated by higher number of juveniles in relatively open areas above treeline. The total leaf area increased (p<0.001) with stem cross-section area in both habitats. However, the SLA was higher below treeline (55 cm2/g) than above (47 cm2/g) (p> 0.001); it also increased with the canopy cover of trees (R = 0.59, p<0.001) below the treeline. In conclusion, high density of juvenile, low mortality of seedlings, and low SLA above treeline indicated that the species has successfully adapted in climatically stressful alpine habitat with potential to expand upward.","[Sharma, Prasad Krishna; Tiwari, Achyut; Shrestha, Babu Bharat] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kathmandu 44613, Nepal; [Sharma, Prasad Krishna] Budhanilkantha Sch, Kathmandu 44622, Nepal",,"Shrestha, BB (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kathmandu 44613, Nepal.",krishnaprasadsharmaacharya@gmail.com; achyutone@gmail.com; shresthabb@gmail.com,,,,,,,,6.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2020,17.0,3,,,,,602,613,,10.1007/s11629-019-5386-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-019-5386-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000519163500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Elevation-dependent warming (EDW) can accelerate the rate of change in mountain ecosystems, cryospheric systems, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. Here we review important mechanisms that contribute towards EDW: snow albedo and surface-based feedbacks; water vapour changes and latent heat release; surface water vapour and radiative flux changes; surface heat loss and temperature change; and aerosols. All lead to enhanced warming with elevation (or at a critical elevation), and it is believed that combinations of these mechanisms may account for contrasting regional patterns of EDW. We discuss future needs to increase knowledge of mountain temperature trends and their controlling mechanisms through improved observations, satellite-based remote sensing and model simulations.","[Pepin, N.] Univ Portsmouth, Dept Geog, Portsmouth PO1 3HE, Hants, England; [Bradley, R.

Analysis of hydrochemical facies revealed that 57.14, 39.29, and 3.57% of samples were Ca-Mg-HCO3-, Ca-Mg-Cl- and Mg-HCO3- water types, respectively. Gibbs diagrams illustrate the effects of the dissolution of carbonates and silicates during weathering on groundwater hydrogeochemistry. The PHREEQC modelling depicted that most of the secondary minerals are supersaturated except for halite, sylvite, and magnetite which are undersaturated and in equilibrium with nature. Multivariate statistical techniques, including principal component analysis, were applied for source apportionment indicating that the hydrochemistry of the groundwater was mainly controlled by geogenic sources (rock-water interaction) along with secondary pollution through increased anthropogenic sources. Heavy metal accumulation in groundwater depicted the order of Cd > Cr > Mn > Fe > Cu > Ni > Zn. EWQI analysis revealed that none of the samples fell into excellent and good categories. In total, 92.86% of groundwater samples were in an average category while the rest of the samples (7.14%) were unfit for drinking.

GlabTop model was used to estimate the glacier thickness and potential lakes that could develop in the future. The study assumes importance since massive hydropower infrastructure is being set up without incorporating any knowledge about the retreating glaciers in the region. Between 1931 and 2018, the glacier lost 30.67% (+/- 2.87%) at a rate of 0.35% per year. The snout of the glacier retreated by similar to 797 m (+/- 19.7 m) between 1931 and 2018 at a rate of 9.1 m a(-1). The rate of retreat increased to similar to 20 m a(-1) very recently from 2014 to 2018. The geodetic mass balance estimates suggest that the glacier lost 6.78 Gt (+/- 2.05 Gt) of mass at a rate of 84.8 Mt a(-1) between 1931 and 2012. The mass loss accelerated at 276.5 Mt a(-1) between 2000 and 2012.

The vegetation assessment of the forests at the habitat and community levels in the forest ecosystems can help in its proper monitoring and formulation of conservation strategies. With this aspect, the present study was conducted in the Shimla water catchment Sanctuary (SWCS) of Western Himalayan region from 2011 to 2014. A total of 476 species of vascular plants were recorded with angiosperms (101 families, 307 genera, and 431 species), gymnosperms (3 families, 7 genera, and 9 species), and pteridophytes (11 families, 17 genera, and 36 species). Among these 39 species were the trees, 81 shrubs, 320 herbs, and the remaining 36 species were pteridophytes. The quantitative analysis showed the presence of 312 species at varying altitudes, aspects, slopes in the different identified communities. Further, tree communities were delineated based on IVI while shrub communities on the basis of relative density. A total of twenty-one forest communities (trees 15 and shrubs 6) were identified in the altitudinal range between 1850 to 2750 m above msl. In general, Shannon diversity index (H') for trees ranged from 1.40 to 2.10, seedlings (0.67-1.51); saplings (0.62-1.72); shrubs 2.02-3.16 and herbs 2.47-4.38 while the values of concentration of dominance for trees ranged from 0.17 to 0.45, whereas in seedlings these values varied from 0.28 to 0.77. Saplings showed a range of 0.18-0.57, shrubs from 0.03 to 0.17, and herbs 0.03-0.16 for the values of Cd. The similarity values were evaluated by the Jaccard index among different communities in the tree, seedling, sapling, shrub, and herb layers which showed the presence and absence of various species. More than 50 per cent similarity was found in the shrub layer (77 community pairs) followed by seedling layer (61 community pairs), sapling layer (47 community pairs), and tree layer (44 community pairs). Least similarity (less than 50 per cent) was found for herb layer (7 community pairs) with maximum dissimilarity. The high level of dissimilarity can be attributed to the high level of disturbance in the forest layer. The application of vegetation indices can be a useful tool in predicting the structure of the forest vegetation and also vital in developing adequate management strategies for conservation of plant diversity. In the SWCS, the plant communities with high species diversity and more heterogeneity require specific conservation strategies as these can be considered as rich zones or pockets of floral diversity in this ecosystem. Invasions by non-native species can be a threat to the forest flora that needs proper management.","[Rana, Dipika] Shoolini Univ Biotechnol & Management Sci, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Solan 173229, Himachal Prades, India; [Rana, Dipika; Kapoor, Kulraj Singh; Samant, Sher Singh] Himalayan Forest Res Inst, Forest Ecol & Climate Change Div, Panthaghati 171013, Shimla, India; [Bhatt, Anupam] CSIR, Environm Technol Div, Inst Himalayan Bioresource & Technol, Palampur 176061, Himachal Prades, India",,"Rana, D (corresponding author), Shoolini Univ Biotechnol & Management Sci, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Solan 173229, Himachal Prades, India.;Rana, D (corresponding author), Himalayan Forest Res Inst, Forest Ecol & Climate Change Div, Panthaghati 171013, Shimla, India.",dipikahfri@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2022,24.0,12,,,,,14011,14032,,10.1007/s10668-021-02020-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-02020-9,,JAN 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000740643200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The recent study aims to assess these changes using spatial decision tool statistical downscaling method (SDSM) and snowmelt runoff model (SRM) for the twenty-first century under representative concentration pathways (RCPs). SDSM considered absolute partial correlation coefficient (abs. Pr.) to evaluate efficiency predictors or the predictands of the Jhelum river basin. The performance evaluation of SDSM assessed using coefficient of determination (R-2) values for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 under CMIP5 (CCSM4). The biases of the daily time series downscaled data removed by using mean-based biased correction method (MB-BC). Stream projection carried out using SRM by incorporating MODIS snow product. Statistical parameters R-2 and volume difference (Dv %) calculated for accuracy assessment of SRM for the simulated and observed discharge (2001-2018). Streamflow projections for the twenty-first century carried out by SRM using de-biased downscaled data. The R-2 indicator of SDSM ranged between 78-81% for temperature and 82-86% for precipitation under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The temperature results indicated an increasing trend of 1.5(o)C and 3.8(o)C for the twenty-first century under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The mean annual precipitation showed a rise of 2-7% while surface runoff projected a rising trend of 3.3-7.4% for RCP-4.5 and RCP-8.5 respectively till the end of the twenty-first century. The study results revealed that Jhelum basin will be wetter and warmer for the twenty-first century as compare to the baseline period. The hydrographs of the river predicted the occurrence of more extreme events in the region for the twenty-first century.

In this context, this paper aims to appraise the empirical studies on land-use and land-cover changes and their impact on ecosystem services in Nepal Himalaya. The study acquired studies fromWeb of Science and Google Scholar for systematic review. Altogether, 90 scientific studies, including 64 on land use and land cover and 26 on ecosystem services, published between 1986 and 2020 focusing Nepal, were assessed. The results show that there were continual changes in land-cover and land-use types in Nepal, as well as in the pace of development due to natural, anthropogenic, and policy factors. According to the national land-cover scenario, forests tended to increase, whereas agricultural land gradually decreased in recent years, with some of the available agricultural land even being abandoned. The scenario of the agricultural land in the Karnali river basin was different from those of the land in the Koshi and Gandaki basins. In the mid-twentieth century, the expansion of agricultural land and massive deforestation were observed, mainly in the Tarai region. Development works, urbanization, and the rural-urban migration led to the gradual decrease in and abandonment of the available agricultural land in recent decades. Further, this overall scenario has determined in provision of ESs. Forests have the highest value of ES, and community forests have played a vital role in their restoration. The concept of payment for ESs has greatly supported socio-economic development and ecosystem conservation. However, the formulation and implementation of effective landscape planning with suitable policies and enforcement mechanisms is essential to balance the negative impact of LULC on the sustained management of ecosystems and their associated services.","[Rai, Mohan Kumar; Paudel, Basanta; Zhang, Yili; Nepal, Pashupati; Liu, Linshan; Rai, Raju] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Rai, Mohan Kumar; Zhang, Yili] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Paudel, Basanta; Zhang, Yili; Nepal, Pashupati; Khanal, Narendra Raj] Chinese Acad Sci Tribhuvan Univ, Kathmandu Ctr Res & Educ, Kathmandu 44613, Nepal",,"Zhang, YL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YL (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci Tribhuvan Univ, Kathmandu Ctr Res & Educ, Kathmandu 44613, Nepal.",mkrai2019@igsnrr.ac.cn; paudelb@igsnrr.ac.cn; zhangyl@igsnrr.ac.cn; pashupati@igsnrr.ac.cn; liuls@igsnrr.ac.cn; rairaju@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR 24,2023,15.0,9,,,,,,,7134,10.3390/su15097134,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15097134,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000987891600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, the variation in phosphorous fraction was investigated through mineralogical studies like grain size analysis and X-ray diffraction. The findings revealed that the surficial sediment of lakes are least influenced by anthropogenic sources, since a slight increase in each of the P-Fractions was observed from year 2011 to 2012, except organic P. Loosely sorbed exchangeable phosphorous was found to be slightly high which was due to difference in atmospheric precipitation, which is one of the strong factors in high altitude regions. Decrease in organic fraction of P indicated that lakes became more oligotrophic in nature. Mineralogical investigation shows that illite-montmorillonite and montmorillonite are the main minerals in Sella Lake, whereas montmorillonite and graphite are main minerals in P.T.Tso lake. Factor analysis of seasonal data of P fractionation in surface sediments, along with physical parameters of Sella Lake water indicates three factors for the 2011 data principle factors are pH, EC, oxide-bound and organic P. Factor analysis of P.T.Tso lake water indicates three factors for the 2011 data with principle factors are adsorbed P and authigenic P, pH, oxide-bound P. This study shows that except organic fractions all other fractions are increasing in the following year. It implies that even at such remote high altitude locations P characteristics are changing year to year which sought for further investigation and enables HALs to show the early impacts of climate change related changes. A clear influence of long range transported air pollutants has been found through HYSPLIT back trajectory models which needs to be substantiated through long-term monitoring.","[Deka, Jyoti Prakash; Baruah, Beli; Singh, Sangeeta; Chaudhury, Rahul; Prakash, Amit; Kumar, Manish] Tezpur Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sonitpur 784028, Assam, India; [Bhattacharyya, Pradip] North East Ctr, Indian Stat Inst, Tezpur 784028, Assam, India; [Tamil Selvan, M.] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Remote Sensing & GIS Ctr CSRD, New Delhi 110067, India",,"Kumar, M (corresponding author), Tezpur Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Sonitpur 784028, Assam, India.",manish.env@gmail.com,,,,,,,,6.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2015,73.0,11,,,,,7617,7629,,10.1007/s12665-014-3931-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3931-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000354712300068,View Full Record in Web of Science

The 4 leading PCs explaining 52 to 61% of the variance respectively for seasonal and monthly rainfall are found to be statistically significant. When rotated by the varimax method these 4 PCs provide 4 distinct areas of homogeneous rainfall variability for both time scales. The most coherent region is located along the central longitude of the study area, with another coherent region over the extreme western parts. The area east of 81 degrees E is divided into 2 coherent zones roughly along the 22 degrees N parallel.

Marked atmospheric warming has changed the balance of this so-called Asian water tower and altered water resources in downstream countries. In this Review, we synthesize observational evidence and model projections that describe an imbalance in the Asian water tower caused by accelerated transformation of ice and snow into liquid water. This phase change is associated with a south-north disparity due to the spatio-temporal interaction between the westerlies and the Indian monsoon. A corresponding spatial imbalance is exhibited by alterations in freshwater resources in endorheic or exorheic basins. Global warming is expected to amplify this imbalance, alleviating water scarcity in the Yellow and Yangtze River basins and increasing scarcity in the Indus and Amu Darya River basins. However, the future of the Asian water tower remains highly uncertain. Accurate predictions of future water supply require the establishment of comprehensive monitoring stations in data-scarce regions and the development of advanced coupled atmosphere-cryosphere-hydrology models. Such models are needed to inform the development of actionable policies for sustainable water resource management. Atmospheric warming has imbalanced the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan system (the Asian water tower (AWT)).

Station-based monthly rainfall and rainy days data were obtained from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) for the period from 1983 to 2008 and applied, along with two daily rainfall gridded products to establish temporal changes and spatial associations in the study area. Due to the lack of more recent ground station rainfall measurements for the basin, gridded data were then used to establish monthly rainfall spatio-temporal trends for the period 2009 to 2018. The study shows all surface observatories in the catchment experienced an annual decreasing trend in rainfall over the 1983 to 2008 period, averaging 15.75 mm per decade. Analysis of at the monthly and seasonal trend showed reduced rainfall for August and during monsoon season as a whole (10.13 and 11.38 mm per decade, respectively); maximum changes were observed in both monsoon and winter months. Gridded rainfall data were obtained from the Climate Hazard Infrared Group Precipitation Station (CHIRPS) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR). By combining the big data analytical potential of Google Earth Engine (GEE), we compare spatial patterns and temporal trends in observational and modelled precipitation and demonstrate that remote sensing products can reliably be used in inaccessible areas where observational data are scarce and/or temporally incomplete. CHIRPS reanalysis data indicate that there are in fact three significantly distinct annual rainfall periods in the basin, viz. phase 1: 1983 to 1997 (relatively high annual rainfall); phase 2: 1998 to 2008 (drought); phase 3: 2009 to 2018 (return to relatively high annual rainfall again). By comparison, PERSIANN-CDR data show reduced annual and winter precipitation, but no significant changes during the monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons from 1983 to 2008. The major conclusions of this study are that rainfall modelled using CHIRPS corresponds well with the observational record in confirming the decreased annual and seasonal rainfall, averaging 10.9 and 7.9 mm per decade respectively between 1983 and 2008, although there is a trend (albeit not statistically significant) to higher rainfall after the marked dry period between 1998 and 2008.

However, the CO2 carbon exchange characteristics (Gross Primary Productivity, Net Ecosystem Exchange, and Ecosystem respiration) of Indian forests are poorly understood. Immense carbon sequestration opportunities exist with the natural as well as planted forests. Therefore, it becomes vital to assess the potential of existing forests (natural and planted) by means of the most accurate and reliable methods of eddy covariance (EC). It is also important to know the eco-physiological response of the forests towards diurnal, seasonal, and yearly changes in the prevailing environmental conditions. We analyzed CO2 carbon exchange characteristics of a mature moist deciduous forest and a young mixed deciduous plantation located in the sub-tropical climate regime in the western Himalayan foothills of India with the help of co-located EC measurements (2016 to 2018). The study reveals that both the mature forest (- 719.43 gCm(- 2)year(- 1)) and young plantation (- 467.49 gC m(- 2) year(- 1)) are absorbing a significant amount of atmospheric CO2 carbon. The maximum uptake of atmospheric CO2 occurred during the post-monsoon season in both the forests. The minimum NEE of the mixed deciduous plantation was observed during the leaf fall period while the NEE of the moist deciduous forest was the lowest in monsoon due to a higher respiration rate during monsoon. Among the environmental factors, soil moisture showed maximum control on the productivity of both the forest ecosystems. The value reported in this study can help Forest Survey of India in establishing/assessing emission factor for these particular forest types. This study can also help forest managers in carbon assessment of plantation under NDC.","[Watham, Taibanganba; Srinet, Ritika; Nandy, Subrata; Padalia, Hitendra; Sinha, Sanjiv K.; Patel, N.

The ability of any TOF practice to fix soil organic carbon (SOC) efficiently depends on its SOC build up and soil quality that varies across different strata within TOFs. Soil physico-chemical properties under six TOF practices (boundary plantation, roadside plantation, riverside plantation, horticulture, scattered patches with clumpy plantation (SPCP), and woodlot) in central region of Kashmir valley were investigated to assess SOC content and soil quality. Additive soil quality index (ASQI) approach was used to assess soil quality using lower or higher is better criteria. Correlation analysis between soil variables was carried out to assess the relationships. The results showed that TOF soils in the region were sandy clay loam in texture with slightly acidic to alkaline pH and electrical conductivity within normal limits. Lowest bulk density (0.94 g cm(-3)) was found in SPCP and highest (1.38 g cm(-3)) in roadside plantation. Highest SOC %, available nitrogen (N), and available phosphorus (P) values were observed in SPCP and lowest in boundary plantation. Average available potassium (K) was observed highest in SPCP (333.04 kg ha(-1)) and lowest in riverside plantation (244.58 kg ha(-1)). Soil pH showed significant but negative correlations with SOC and other nutrients (N and P). A significant but perfect positive correlation was observed between SOC and available N. SOC content was found highest in SPCP (60.16 t ha(-1)) and lowest in boundary plantation (34.56 t ha(-1)). The hypothesis that all soils under different TOF strata have similar quality and same SOC build up rate was observed otherwise with SPCP exhibiting highest CSQI. SPCP was observed to be more qualitative and dynamic growing system among all strata with an enhanced capacity to fix and conserve SOC to help mitigate climate change. Present study demands plantation of more trees outside the forest areas especially in the pattern of SPCP for enrichment of soil and enhancement of carbon sequestration.","[Mehraj, Basira; Wani, Akhlaq Amin; Gatoo, Aasif Ali; ul Islam, M.

Recent research works showed microplastic deposition and accumulation in the Himalayan mountains and adjoining ecosystems, rivers and streams. Fine particles of microplastic originating from different anthropogenic sources can travel long distances, even upwards (altitudinally) through atmospheric transport and can pollute remote and pristine locations situated in the Himalayas. Precipitation also plays a vital role in influencing deposition and fall-out of microplastics in the Himalayas. Microplastics can be trapped in the snow in glaciers for a long time and can be released into freshwater rivers by snow melting. Microplastic pollution in Himalayan rivers such as the Ganga, Indus, Brahmaputra, Alaknanda, and Kosi has been researched on both the upper and lower catchments. Additionally, Hima-layan region draws many domestic and international tourists throughout the year, resulting in generation of massive and unmanageable volume of plastics wastes and finally ending up in the open landscapes covering forests, river streams and valley. Fragmentation of these plastic wastes can lead to microplastic formation and accumulation in the Himalayas. This paper discusses and explains occurrence and distribution of microplastics in the Himalayan land-scapes, possible adverse effects of microplastic on local ecosystems and human population and policy intervention needed to mitigate microplastic pollution in the Himalayas. A knowledge gap was noticed regarding the fate of microplastics in the freshwater ecosystems and their control mechanisms in the Indian Himalayas.

In the context of global warming, most glaciers are melting and receding, which can have significant impacts on ecology, climate, and water resources. Thus, it is important to study glacier mass change, in order to assess and project its variations from past to future. Here, the Karakoram, one of the most concentrated glacierized areas in High-Mountain Asia (HMA), was selected as the study area. This study utilized SRTM-C DEM and ICESat-2 to investigate glacier mass change in the Karakoram, and its response to climatic and topographical factors during 2000-2021. The results of the data investigation showed that, overall, the Karakoram Anomaly still exists, with an annual averaged mass change rate of 0.02 +/- 0.09 m w.e.yr(-1). In different sub-regions, it was found that the western and central Karakoram glaciers gained ice mass, while the eastern Karakoram glaciers lost ice mass in the past two decades. In addition, it was discovered that the increasing precipitation trend is leading to mass gains in the western and central Karakoram glaciers, whereas increasing temperature is causing ice mass loss in the eastern Karakoram glacier. Generally, decreasing net shortwave radiation and increasing cloud cover in the Karakoram restricts ice mass loss, while topographical shading and debris cover also have dominant impacts on glacier mass change.","[Lhakpa, Drolma; Fan, Yubin; Cai, Yu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Land Satellite Remote Sensing Applicat Min, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Lhakpa, Drolma; Fan, Yubin; Cai, Yu] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Novel Software Tech, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Lhakpa, Drolma] Tibet Inst Plateau Atmospher & Environm Sci, Tibet Meteorol Bur, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [Lhakpa, Drolma] Key Lab Atmospher Environm Tibet Autonomous Reg, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China",,"Cai, Y (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Ocean Sci, Jiangsu Prov Key Lab Geog Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Land Satellite Remote Sensing Applicat Min, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.;Cai, Y (corresponding author), Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Novel Software Tech, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",caiyu@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,,7.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2022,14.0,24,,,,,,,6281,10.3390/rs14246281,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14246281,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000904505400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A small rain-fed tributary of Teesta, Karala, has almost decayed in recent years but no notable assessment of its condition has been done to date. This study mainly aims to measure the intensity of human interventions and related responses of Karala through reach-wise, multiple indicator-based assessments. Initially, the reaches have been delineated by segmenting the river into 10 equidistant segments. Characterization of land-use and land-cover has been done for all such reaches. To determine the nature of hydro-geomorphology and water quality of the river 14 indicators are selected and categorized into 3 indices. According to the measured reach-wise mean (R-m), with the highest 4.70 (Reach 1) and lowest 2.21 (R9), it is clear that the need for restoration increases downstream since those areas portray massive deviation from least disturbed conditions (LDC). It is also revealed that the change in the bar area (ID7), vegetation condition (ID3), non-point sources of pollution (NPSP), and channel width (ID8) indicate also an alarming condition within the lower part of the river channel. It is evident that as the river approaches downstream, the natural state of landcover is lost due to intensive human intervention, mostly due to massive land-use transformation reflected in a 600% increase in built-up area in and around the Jalpaiguri region from 1990 to 2020. Hydrologically as well as ecologically sensitive rivers like Karala are the inseparable parts of the sub-Himalayan foothills. Degradation of such, due to, the human alteration would eventually disarrange the entire ecosystem. This easy-to-use, rapid, and coast effective methodology was found useful in distinguishing the extent of alterations by human intervention and the responses of such river systems.","[Mondal, Snigdha; Mitra, Suman; Dey, Jhantu; Tamang, Lakpa] Univ Calcutta, Dept Geog, Kolkata 700019, India",,"Tamang, L (corresponding author), Univ Calcutta, Dept Geog, Kolkata 700019, India.",ltgeog@caluniv.ac.in,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2021,193.0,10,,,,,,,667,10.1007/s10661-021-09467-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09467-3,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000701291000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Brengi stream is a major tributary of the Upper Jhelum River in Kashmir Himalaya. The sinkhole swallowed the entire stream flow and caused mass mortality of fish and other aquatic creatures, besides disrupting completely the local water supplies. The present study analyzed the ancillary data reports, geological and topographic maps, satellite and Google Earth images, and climatic data in conjunction with the field, geophysical and chemical tracer studies to understand the causes of sinkhole formation, the outlet of captured flow and its associated hazards. The study indicated the sinkhole as a Collapse Sinkhole formed due to the collapse of the limestone (Triassic) roof cap of an existing deep-seated underground cavern through a prolonged dissolution and physical erosion by the weakly acidic stream and groundwater circulation under suitable climatic conditions. In this area, the limestone bedrock covered under a thick pile of overburden alluvial material comprises large structural discontinuities (bedding planes, fractures, joints and shear zones) and karst features. Before the collapse, a large water pool consisting similar to 80 m(3) of the water column was estimated to be at the sinkhole site. Proton Precession Magnetometer survey around the sinkhole indicated that the underlying caverns are about similar to 100 m long downstream. A stream flow of similar to 15.03 m(3)/s was estimated to be swallowed by the sinkhole continuously for a couple of weeks till its closure. As a consequence, an estimated area of similar to 77.15 km(2) comprising 58% agricultural/horticultural land, 25% vegetation cover and 10% built-up area was at high risk of catastrophe downstream of the sinkhole. From the tracer study, the outlet of the sinking water was found located at 16 km downstream at Achabal springs with an average flow velocity of similar to 1.3 km/h from the sinkhole site to the outlet. The sinkhole is a part and characteristic feature of karst topography of the area. Therefore, a detailed study on sinkhole susceptibility and hazard assessment is required. Although the sinkhole formation is an event of local significance in terms of the scale of the disaster, it may be of extreme importance in planning a given investment and management of local groundwater resources and karst springs.","[Mir, Riyaz Ahmad] Geol Survey India, Srinagar 190008, Jammu And Kashm, India; [Mir, Riyaz Ahmad; Ahmed, Rayees; Ahmed, Pervez; Ahmad, Syed Towseef; Wani, Gowhar Farooq; Rather, Abid Farooq; Bhat, Irshad Ahmad; Bhat, Waseem Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Geog & Disaster Management, Srinagar 190006, Jammu And Kashm, India; [Hussain, Majid; Bukhari, Syed Kaiser; Ahad, Aasif Ibni] Natl Inst Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Srinagar 190006, Jammu And Kashm, India; [Dar, Reyaz Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu And Kashm, India",,"Ahmed, R (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Geog & Disaster Management, Srinagar 190006, Jammu And Kashm, India.",rayeesrashid84@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,2023 APR 6,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10668-023-03204-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-03204-1,,APR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000963908800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

We estimated ecosystem-level C stock and factors affecting C stock in six major forest types; tropical wet evergreen forest, montane subtropical forest, temperate forest, bamboo forest, quercus forest, and jhum land of the eastern Himalayan region (India). We determined ecosystem structure, biodiversity, and plant and soil C stock by laying random plots in each forest site. The average C stock was estimated in the range of 79.0-373.4 Mg C ha(-1) and found significantly different among the forest types. Partitioning ecosystem C stocks in plant (24-55%), soils (43-75%), deadwood (1-4.8%) and litter (0.20-1.25%) components varied largely. Pearson correlation analysis shows a significant positive relation of basal area with species diversity, tree density, and ecosystem C stock. Linear mixed-effect model demonstrates the high influence of species density and soil moisture content on the ecosystem C stock. We recommend the inclusion of forest structural attributes and pedological characteristics while predicting synergies between C stock and future climatic conditions. Additionally, conversion of natural forests to jhum land should be minimized because they stored lesser ecosystem C stocks thus plays a minimum role in C accumulation and cycling. The study provides estimates of C stocks in major forests that can be useful in suggesting a path forward to partially fulfill India's commitments to REDD + policy.","[Gogoi, Anudip; Ahirwal, Jitendra; Sahoo, Uttam Kumar] Mizoram Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Nat Resource Management, Dept Forestry, Aizawl 796004, India",,"Sahoo, UK (corresponding author), Mizoram Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Nat Resource Management, Dept Forestry, Aizawl 796004, India.",uksahoo_2003@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,,33.0,35.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 15,2022,302.0,,A,,,,,,113972,10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113972,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113972,,OCT 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000711265600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Field measurement is one of the most important ways to study the mass balance of glaciers. Based on observations of mass balance in the ablation zone of Shuiguan Glacier No.4, Qilian Mountains, China, combined with the balance ratio between accumulation and ablation, we established a linear relation between mass balance and altitude. The results show that the mean annual mass balance of this glacier was similar to 510 mm w.e. from 2010 to 2013. The uncertainty in the balance ratio value does not lead to a significant difference in the mass balance. The equilibrium-line altitude rose by 180 m from 1972 to 2013, while the accumulation-area ratio decreased from 0.68 to 0.25. These variations may be caused by changes in air temperature. Meanwhile, the glacier is at present not in a steady state, and it may continue to shrink by a further similar to 900 m, even without further climate warming. In the western Lenglongling Mountains, assuming that the glaciers are in a steady state and the Equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) remain similar, there will be only 46 glaciers left, covering a total area of 19.2 km(2), in other words, only 22.3% of the glaciers area in 1972.","[Cao, Bo; Pan, Bao-tian; Wang, Jie] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst MOE, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Cai, Ming-yong] MEP, Satellite Environm Ctr, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",,"Pan, BT (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Key Lab Western Chinas Environm Syst MOE, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",caobo@lzu.edu.cn; panbt@lzu.edu.cn; caimingyong@126.com; wangjie@lzu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,5.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2017,14.0,8,,,,,1624,1632,,10.1007/s11629-016-4064-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-016-4064-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000407267400014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The spatial extent of these variables has an utmost importance in development of the SD model and for projecting the precipitation series. In this paper, an attempt is made to identify the spatial extent of atmospheric variables in terms of National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) grid points that result in development of an efficient SD model for precipitation. A case study of the Yamuna-Hindon interbasin is considered to illustrate the applicability of the methodology proposed for capturing the effect of spatial domain of atmospheric variables on development of the SD model. The precipitation in the area is likely to be influenced by surrounding climate, topography, atmospheric circulation, thermodynamic processes, etc. Various cases of spatial extent, which covers a combination of NCEP grid points (containing atmospheric data), are constructed and SD models are developed for each case. SD Models are evaluated for performance using statistical measures. The statistical analysis revealed that though the complete coverage of atmospheric variables gives a better result, the atmospheric activities on NCEP grid points located in Himalayan region have a higher influence on precipitation in the Yamuna-Hindon interbasin. The best performing SD model is then practiced with various emission scenarios.","[Arora, Himanshu; Ojha, C. S.

The one-dimensional surface water quality model, QUAL2Kw was selected and compared for water quality simulations. Calibration and validation were separately performed for the model predictions over different climate classes. The accuracy of the water quality model was assessed using different statistical analyses. The spatial profile of WQI was calculated using model predictions based on dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate (NO3), and pH. The results showed that there is a smaller longitudinal variation of WQI in the cold climatic regions than other regions, which does not change the status of WQI. Streams from arid, temperate, and tropical climatic regions show a decreasing trend of DO with respect to the longitudinal profiles of main river flows.

Remote sensing data have proven to be an asset for the assessment of the spatial distribution of species over time. We used time-series data from a single sensor (PlanetScope) and dual-sensor (PlanetScope with Sentinel-2) to map Dalbergia sissoo, a timber species, found on both sides of the Jakhan river in Dehradun district of Lesser Himalaya. The dimensionality of the temporal images was reduced by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and class-based sensor independent NDVI (CBSI-NDVI). Separability analysis was conducted to find optimal dates of the data set using three measures of separability, and Euclidean distance was found to be the best measure of separability for both the indices. Due to limitations of the classifiers in handling mixed pixels, a fuzzy-based modified possibilistic c-means (MPCM) algorithm was tested to extract a single class, i.e., Shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) tree. We used the conventional mean and individual sample as mean (ISM) as training parameter concepts in the MPCM supervised classification approach. We found that the ISM approach was able to handle the heterogeneity within the class for both vegetation indices. It was seen that PlanetScope data were able to spatially map the target class in a better way, whereas combined data of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 helped to reduce the spectral overlap between target and nontarget classes. An accuracy assessment was performed using mean membership difference, variance, and entropy where variance and entropy showed that NDVI-based ISM approach outperformed the CBSI-NDVI-based approach.

Data is collected through field survey. Exclusively for each tree species, a multicollinearity test was performed among 24 independent or environment variables (21 bioclimatic and 3 topographic). The highly correlated independent variables (r >= 0.9, Pearson correlation coefficient) were eliminated from the independent variables list. In this study, we employed the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model to produce current (2015-2016) as well as RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate-change scenarios by 2050 for tree species spatial distribution results. The jackknife test was carried out to depict the importance of variables with the highest gain and it was observed that overall elevation, precipitation, and temperature are the factors with the highest gain. The results of the MaxEnt model for each tree species were satisfactory with ROC (receiver operating characteristic) AUC (area under the curve) curve training and testing values greater than 0.9 and 0.84 respectively. Based on 10-percentile training presence threshold-dependent values, the overall accuracy of True Skill Statistics (TSS) was more than 80%.

The present work aims to study soil properties, litter dynamics and biomass carbon storage for the three common bamboo species from the Terai region of Indian Eastern Himalayas. Bambusa nutans, Dendrocalamus giganteus and Melocanna baccifera groves were selected for the present study. The soil pH, moisture and electrical conductivity under different bamboo groves of three species varied significantly, but moisture and electrical conductivity responded inconsistently with increasing soil depth. Similarly, the amount of soil available primary nutrients also varied significantly, where soils of M. baccifera grove were quantified with highest amount of these nutrients at all depths. M. baccifera grove produced the highest litter, although the difference with the other two groves was non-significant. The amount of oxidizable soil organic carbon quantified varied significantly among the bamboo groves, with the highest SOC content under the M. baccifera grove. The decomposition rate gradually increased with time, and within 9 months, the entire litter got decomposed. The annual return of nutrients was in the order N > K > P. The total biomass of D. giganteus, B. nutans and M. baccifera was estimated at 270.97, 127.21 and 16.31 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Based on the higher R-2 and adj R-2, and lower AIC and HQC, Model 1 was more appropriate for B. nutans and D. giganteus, whereas Model 2 was suitable for M. baccifera. The ecosystem carbon stock of D. giganteus was significantly (163.28 Mg ha(-1)) higher than the other two species because of its significantly higher biomass carbon accumulation. This amount of biomass carbon storage and ecosystem carbon stock is comparable with agroforestry and forest ecosystems in the study region or elsewhere. The present study suggests these bamboos can be a feasible option for carbon farming and carbon trading, climate change adaptation and mitigation, apart from its contribution in social and economic contributions to the region's rural life. Therefore, value addition and nationalizing of bamboo are recommended to improve rural folks' livelihood. Encouraging value-added bamboo products can be negative feedback to climate change because of their durability and thus permanency of carbon stored in it.","[Kumar, P.

As a regular exercise of field sampling of various forest types to map the biorich areas, the number of species observed was evaluated to analyze their endemic status in one of the important hotspot regions of the world. The total number of individuals, species, genera and families observed were recorded in various natural and semi-natural forest types. A total of 122 plots sampled randomly in various forest types recorded 764 plant species, of which 59 were found to be endemic. The overall species endemism is observed to be 13 per ha. These 59 species belong to 27 families and 46 genera. Fifty percent of species were from just five families, Rubiaceae, Lauraceae, Acanthaceae, Magnoliaceae and Rosaceae. Stem size class distribution of the most abundantly found endemic tree species in three primary forest types indicated a quantitative status. This study envisages the status of plant endemism carried out following a proportional stratified random sampling method for various classified vegetation cover types using satellite remote sensing data. Many primitive genera and families were recorded which are indicative of long evolutionary age and affinities of the area with respect to species endemism.","Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Behera, MD (corresponding author), Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",,,,,,,,,40.0,43.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2002,11.0,4,,,,,669,682,,10.1023/A:1015596309833,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1015596309833,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000175634400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Himalayas are the world's youngest, highest and largest mountain range and support a high plant biodiversity. People living in this region use their traditional ecological knowledge to utilize local natural resources and hence have valuable understanding about their surroundings. Many areas within this region still remain poorly known for their floristic diversity, plant species distribution and vegetation ecosystem services, yet the indigenous people depend heavily upon local plant resources and, through unsustainable use, can cause an irreversible loss of plant species. The valley used in this study is typical of such areas and occupies a distinctive geographical location on the edge of the western Himalayan range, close to the Hindu Mush range to the west and the Karakorum Mountains to the north. It is also located on geological and climatic divides, which further add to its ecological interest. This paper focuses on (i) identification of ecological indicators at various elevation zones across an altitudinal range of 2450-4100m and (ii) recognition of social perceptions of plant species populations based on the ecosystem services that they provide. We used robust approaches to identify the plant indicator species of various elevation zones. Using phytosociological techniques, Importance Values (IVs) for each plant species were calculated. The statistical package PCORDS was used to evaluate the species area curves and indicator species for each elevation zone. Data attribute plots derived from Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) using CANOCO were deployed to illustrate the location of indicator species in each habitat type. Furthermore, the social perceptions of the local inhabitants as to whether the populations of the recorded species were increasing or decreasing over the recent past were recorded. We argue that the assessment of ecological indicators combined with the ecological knowledge of the indigenous population can assist in developing priorities for local and regional conservation strategies, especially for fragile mountain ecosystems.

Out of multiple seismic regions in the Himalayas, Bhutan Himalaya is one that reigns prominent. Bhutan has seen several moderate-sized earthquakes in the past century and various recent works show that a major earthquake like the 2015 Nepal earthquake is impending. The southwestern city of Bhutan, Phuentsholing is one of the most populated regions in the country and the present study aims to explore the area using geophysical methods (Multispectral Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW)) for understanding possibilities pertaining to infrastructural development. The work involved a geophysical study on eight different sites in the study region which fall under the local area plan of Phuentsholing City. The geophysical study helps to discern shear wave velocity which indicates the soil profile of a region along with possible seismic hazard during an earthquake event, essential for understanding the withstanding power of the infrastructure foundation. The acquired shear wave velocity by MASW indicates visco-elastic soil profile down to a depth of 22.2 m, and it ranged from 350 to 600 m/s. A site response analysis to understand the correlation of bedrock rigidness to the corresponding depth was conducted using EERA (Equivalent-linear Earthquake Site Response Analysis) software. The amplification factors are presented for each site and maximum amplification factors are highlighted. These results have led to a clear indication of how the bedrock characteristics influence the surface ground motion parameters for the corresponding structure period. The results infer that the future constructional activity in the city should not be limited to two- to five-story buildings as per present practice. Apart from it, a parametric study was initiated to uncover whatever effects rigid bedrock has upon hazard parameters for various depths of soil profile up to 30 m, 40 m, 60 m, 80 m, 100 m, 120 m, 140 m, 160 m, 180 m and 200 m from the ground surface. The overriding purpose of doing said parametric study is centered upon helping the stack holders who can use the data for future development. Such a study is the first of its kind for the Bhutan region, which suffers from the unavailability of national seismic code, and this is a preliminary step towards achieving it.","[Tempa, Karma] Royal Univ Bhutan, Dept Civil Engn, Coll Sci & Technol, Phuentsholing 21101, Bhutan; [Sarkar, Raju] Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi 110042, India; [Sarkar, Raju; Acharya, Saroj] Royal Univ Bhutan, Ctr Disaster Risk Reduct & Community Dev Studies, Phuentsholing 21101, Bhutan; [Dikshit, Abhirup; Pradhan, Biswajeet] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Adv Modelling & Geospatial Informat Syst CAMG, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia; [Pradhan, Biswajeet] Sejong Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Resources Engn, 209 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05006, South Korea; [Simonelli, Armando Lucio] Univ Sannio, Dept Civil Engn, I-82100 Benevento, Italy; [Alamri, Abdullah M.] King Saud Univ, Dept Geol & Geophys, Coll Sci, P Box 2455, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",,"Sarkar, R (corresponding author), Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi 110042, India.;Sarkar, R (corresponding author), Royal Univ Bhutan, Ctr Disaster Risk Reduct & Community Dev Studies, Phuentsholing 21101, Bhutan.",karmatempa.cst@rub.edu.bt; rajusarkar@dce.ac.in; abhirup.dikshit@student.uts.edu.au; biswajeet.pradhan@uts.edu.au; alsimone@unisannio.it; sacharya@nchm.gov.bt; amsamri@ksu.edu.sa,,,,,,,,12.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2020,12.0,13,,,,,,,5273,10.3390/su12135273,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12135273,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000550141800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, determining the extent of such variations on regional and local scales is imperative. We used monthly precipitation data from 25 meteorological stations in northern Pakistan (NP) to document the observed changes in seasonal and annual precipitation. The station density in the NP is small and unevenly distributed; therefore, ERA-5 reanalysis data were used to supplement the observed dataset to assess the spatial trends in NP. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK), Sen's Slope estimator (SSE), and Sequential Mann-Kendall (SQMK) tests were performed to assess the trends. In addition, the wavelet analysis technique was used to determine the association of precipitation with various oceanic indices from 1960 to 2016. Results indicate that maximum precipitation was shown in the annual and summer seasons. In NP, annual, winter, spring, and summer precipitation declined, while an increase in autumn was observed at a rate of 0.43 mm/decade between 1989 and 2016. The spatial trends for observed and ERA-5 reanalysis datasets were almost similar in winter, spring, and autumn; however, some disagreement was observed in both datasets in the summer and annual precipitation trends in NP during 1960-2016. Between 1989 and 2016, summer and annual precipitation increased significantly in Region III. However, seasonal and annual precipitation decreased in NP between 1960 and 2016. Moreover, there were no prominent trends in annual precipitation until the mid-1980s, but an apparent increase from 1985 onwards. Annual precipitation increased in all elevations except at the 500-1000 m zone. The ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) shared notable interannual coherences among all indices above 16-64 months. Inter-decadal coherence with the ENSO, AO (Arctic Oscillation), and PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) in NP for 128 months and above. Generally, AO, AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), and NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) exhibited less coherence with precipitation in NP. The regression of seasonal and annual precipitation revealed that winter and spring precipitation levels had higher linear regression with the AO and ENSO, respectively, while both the AO and ENSO also dominated at the annual scale. Similarly, the IOD and PDO indices had a higher influence in summer precipitation. The findings may help water resource managers and climate researchers develop a contingency plan for better water resource management policies in the face of changing climate change in Pakistan, particularly in NP.","[Rebi, Ansa; Zhou, Jinxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jianshui Res Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Rebi, Ansa; Zhou, Jinxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab State Forestry, Grassland Adm Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Hussain, Azfar; Cao, Jianhua] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Karst Geol, Int Res Ctr Karst Ausp UNESCO, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Hussain, Ishtiaq] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Appl Math, Taoyuan 32023, Taiwan; [Ullah, Waheed] Rabdan Acad, Def & Secur, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Abbas, Haider] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Synth Res Ctr Chinese Ecosyst Res Network, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ullah, Safi] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",,"Zhou, JX (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jianshui Res Stn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.;Zhou, JX (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab State Forestry, Grassland Adm Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",ishtiaqhucane@gmail.com; wullah@ra.ac.ae; habbas@igsnrr.ac.cn; safikhalil442@yahoo.com; zjx001@bjfu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,8.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 15,2023,14.0,5,,,,,,,871,10.3390/atmos14050871,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos14050871,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000995632900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper analyses the alleged economic loss due to livestock depredation by these carnivores, and the retaliatory responses of an agro-pastoral community around Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary in the Indian trans-Himalaya. The three villages studied (80 households) attributed a total of 189 livestock deaths (18% of the livestock holding) over a period of 18 months to wild predators, and this mould amount to a loss per household equivalent to half the average annual per capita income. The financial compensation received by the villagers from the Government amounted to 3% of the perceived annual loss. Recent intensification of the conflict seems related to a 37.7% increase in livestock holding in the last decade. Villagers have been killing the wolf, though apparently not the snow leopard. A self-financed compensation scheme, and modification of existing livestock pens are suggested as area-specific short-term measures to reduce the conflict. The need to address the problem of increasing livestock holding in the long run is emphasized.","Ctr Ecol Res & Conservat, 3076-5,IV Cross Gokulam Pk, Mysore 570002, Karnataka, India",,"Mishra, C (corresponding author), Wageningen Univ Agr, Dept Terr Ecol & Nat Conservat, 69 Bornsesteeg, NL-6708 PD Wageningen, Netherlands.",Charud.Mishra@student.ton.wau.nl,,,,,,,,232.0,273.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,1997,24.0,4,,,,,338,343,,10.1017/S0376892997000441,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892997000441,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000071436300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study explores the diverse microbial communities, distribution pattern of potential pathogens, and fecal indicators between the geographically distinct Himalayan and Peninsular river systems of India. It also inquires into the environmental factors associated with community variance and distribution pattern of microbial indicators. The application of high-throughput amplicon sequencing approach unveiled significant demarcation (p < 0.004, Anosim R = 0.62) of samples suggesting unique microbial diversities in these two river sediments. Random forest analysis revealed Desulfobulbulus , PSB_M_3, and Opitutus in Himalayan, while DA101, Bacillus, and Streptomyces in the Peninsular as significant contributors to develop overall dissimilarity between the river systems. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance and co-occurrence network analysis were used to study the relationships between microbial taxa and environmental factors. Amongst the various studied environmental parameters, pH, K, Ca, Mg, Ba, and Al in the Himalayan and salinity, Na, temperature, and Th in the Peninsular significantly influenced shaping of distinct microbial communities. Furthermore, the potential pathogenic genera, including Flavobacterium, Clostridium, Arcobacter, Pseudomonas, and Bacillus were highly prevalent in both the river systems. Arcobacter , Clostridium , Acinetobacter, Bacteroides, and Caloramator were the prominent fecal indicators in these river systems. Our findings provide salient information about the crucial role and interplay between various environmental factors and anthropogenic influences in framing the microbiome of the distinct river systems in India. Moreover, assessing potential pathogenic and fecal indicators suggest the public health risk associated with untreated sewage discharge into these water sources. The detection of various F/S indicators and potentially pathogenic bacteria in Himalayan and Peninsular river systems emphasize the urgent need for future monitoring and management of major riverine systems in India.

The length of the glacier is about 4.6km, and snout elevation is about 4028mm.s.l. The mass balance of this glacier was calculated using field-based measurements for few years during 1994 to 2000. However, due to remote and poor accessibility, the field-based measurements could not continue; thus, remote sensing-based methods become useful tool to estimate the long-term mass balance of the glacier. In this study, glacier mass balance has been determined using accumulation area ratio (AAR) method. Remote sensing data sets, e.g. Landsat TM, ETM+and OLI, have been used to estimate AAR for different years from 1994 to 2014. An attempt has also been made to develop a mathematical relationship between remote sensing-derived AAR and field-observed mass balance data of the glacier. Further, this relationship has been used to estimate mass balance of the glacier for different years using remote sensing-derived AAR. Estimated mass balance was validated from ground-observed mass balance for few years. The field-observed and remote sensing-derived mass balance data are compared and showed high correlation. It has been observed that AAR for the Dokriani Glacier varies from 0.64 to 0.71. Mass balance of the glacier was observed between -15.54cm and -50.95cm during the study period.

Considering the adverse effects of chemical fertilizers, bio-inoculants should be encouraged as natural nutrient resource. Two indigenous bio-inoculants i.e. psychrotolerant diazotroph Pseudomonas palleroniana strain N26 and phosphate solubilizer Pseudomonas jesenii strain MP1 were evaluated for their plant growth promoting potential against chickpea in organic and conventionally managed soils under natural net house conditions. Furthermore, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR (qPCR) techniques were used to analyse the microbial diversity and dynamics during the experiment. Comparative agronomical and biochemical crop parameters revealed that organic soils co-inoculated with bioinoculants have 24.69%, 37.42%, 100.65%, 83.33%, 60.86% and 103.05% improvement in plant shoot length, root length, dry weight, fresh weight, chlorophyll content and nitrate reductase activity, respectively, over the control. Similarly, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium content of co-inoculated soils was at par with their respective controls. Moreover, qPCR and DGGE-based soil bacterial dynamics unveiled the persistence of both the strains until the end of crop maturity without affecting the native micro-flora. Conclusively, bio-inoculants alone were found sufficient to fulfil crop nutritional requirement.

Carbon use efficiency (CUE) is an essential metric used to evaluate the carbon sequestration capacity and efficiency of Vegetation. Previous studies have emphasized the importance of assessing CUE at specific regions and times to better understand its spatiotemporal variations. The southeastern region of Tibet in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is recognized as one of the most biodiverse areas in China and globally, characterized by diverse vegetation types ranging from subtropical to temperate. In this study, we focused on Nyingchi, which is the largest virgin forest area in southeast Tibet, to explore the spatial-temporal dynamic characteristics of regional CUE based on MODIS remote sensing products. The following results were obtained: (1) On a monthly scale, regional CUE exhibits significant seasonal variations, with varying patterns among different vegetation types. Specifically, the fluctuation of CUE is the lowest in high-altitude forest areas and the greatest in grasslands and barrens. On an annual scale, forests exhibit higher fluctuations than areas with sparse vegetation and the overall volatility of CUE increased over the past 11 years. (2) There are regional differences in the trend of CUE changes, with a substantial downward trend in the Himalayan region and a significant upward trend in the residual branches of the Gangdise Mountains. More than 75% of the regions exhibit no persistent trend in CUE changes. (3) Vegetation type is the main determinant of the range and characteristics of vegetation CUE changes, while the geographical location and climatic conditions affect the variation pattern. CUE in the southern and northern regions of Nyingchi at 28.5 degrees N exhibits different responses to temperature and precipitation changes, with temperature having a more significant impact on CUE.","[Yang, Ziyan; Yu, Qiang; Yang, Ziyu; Peng, Anchen; Zeng, Yufan; Liu, Wei; Zhao, Jikai] Beiing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Beiing 100083, Peoples R China; [Yang, Di] Univ Wyoming, Ctr Geog Informat, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",,"Yu, Q (corresponding author), Beiing Forestry Univ, Coll Forestry, Beiing 100083, Peoples R China.",yuqiang@bjfu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1,2023,15.0,9,,,,,,,2382,10.3390/rs15092382,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15092382,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000987876300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Arsenic contaminated aquifers are pervasive within narrow entrenched channels and flood plains (T-0-Surface) of fine-grained grey to black coloured argillaceous organic rich Holocene sediments (Newer Alluvium). Contaminated aquifers are often located close to distribution of abandoned or existing channels and swamps. The Pleistocene Older Alluvium upland terraces (T-2-Surface) made up of oxidized yellowish brown sediments with calcareous and ferruginous concretions and the aquifers within it are free of arsenic contamination. MGP sediments are mainly derived from the Himalaya with minor inputs from the Peninsular India. The potential source of arsenic in MGP is mainly from the Himalaya. The contaminated aquifers in the Terai belt of Nepal are closely comparable in nature and age to those of the MGP. Arsenic was transported from disseminated sources as adsorbed on dispersed phases of hydrated-iron-oxide and later on released to groundwater mainly by reductive dissolution of hydrated-iron-oxide and corresponding oxidation of organic matter in aquifer. Strong reducing nature of groundwater is indicated by high concentration of dissolved iron (11.06 mg/l). Even within the arsenic-affected areas, dugwells are found to be arsenic safe due to oxyginated nature.","Jadavpur Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Kolkata 700032, India",,"Shah, BA (corresponding author), Jadavpur Univ, Dept Geol Sci, Kolkata 700032, India.",bashahju@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,49.0,53.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2008,53.0,7,,,,,1553,1561,,10.1007/s00254-007-0766-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-0766-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000252276100018,View Full Record in Web of Science

A multi-stage stratified random sampling procedure was used to select 400 farmers, and the data were collected using a well-structured questionnaire. The multinomial logistic regression model (MNL) was employed to determine the factors influencing farmers' choice for agricultural output marketing channels of tomato crop. The results revealed that most of the tomato produce transacted through output marketing channels, namely producer-wholesaler-retailer-consumer (44.0%) and producer-commission agent-retailer-consumer (35.5%). The empirical results of MNL indicated that education, farm income, farming experience, distance to market, payment at the time of sale, payment in advance and slow sale were the major factors which are positively significant at 1% significant level influences the farmers choice to sell their tomato produce to wholesaler. Relying on the survey observations, to increase market participation in other channels study indicated that there is a need to improve market infrastructure, such as storage facility, market near farmgate and market information.

Its rapid deployment also comes up with various environmental issues which cannot be neglected at a glance. Previous studies had imposed questions about its sustainable nature and now it becomes important to think about the sustainability of hydropower projects so that the technology would grow effectively in future. This paper reviews the status of research on environmental assessment of hydropower projects. The factors which affect the environmental impacts associated with hydropower generation are also explored. It is found that environmental impact assessment of hydropower projects must be performed considering all aspects and factors which affects the environmental impacts associated with hydropower projects. Most of the previous studies are focused on the estimation of GHG emissions so it is necessary to give emphasis on other environmental impacts like acidification, land use, energy consumption etc. and also consider biomass decomposition in submerged land. In fact it is not worthy to predict the sustainability of hydropower projects without considering almost all biophysical impacts associated with them. The paper also compares large and small hydro considering all sustainability assessment factors. Small hydropower projects are considered as a good alternative to control the problems associated with large hydropower projects but still many studies found that so many issues are associated with small hydro as well which cannot be neglected completely.

The southern part is divided into isolated basins with a number of drilled (deep'') and dug (shallow'') wells. Hydrochemical signatures of elevated strontium (Sr), SiO2, boron (B)-and the geo-thermometric signatures-all indicate a deep circulation of the emerging groundwater. Moreover, for several of the sample sites, water chemical compositions, measured spring and water well temperatures, and reservoir temperatures calculated for spring waters, all point to origin from deep horizons within the basin.

This study evaluates the effect of slope aspect and slope position on water relations and forest attributes across six forest types occurring between 400 m and 2600 m altitude in the Central Himalaya (27 degrees-38 degrees N). We found that predawn tree water potential and soil water potential were generally higher on moist north slope aspect (-0.78 +/- 0.05 MPa and -3.34 +/- 0.18 MPa, respectively) than dry south slope aspect (-0.82 degrees 0.18 MPa and -3.77 +/- 0.18 MPa, respectively). Across six different forests, these values were higher at hill base (-0.71 +/- 0.06 MPa and -2.77 +/- 0.19 MPa, tree predawn water potential and soil water potential, respectively) than other topographical positions. The favorable effect of north aspect and hill base was also observed in maintaining soil water and tree water potential during the dry season. Vegetation attributes, such as species richness, unique species and plant density were also generally higher on north slope and hill base than southern aspect and lowest at hill top. Across forest types, the hill base provided shelter to 46 unique species, compared to 16-18 at the other positions, thus emphasizing its importance as refugia for species to survive climate change induced perturbations. The favorable conditions of hill base position not only contribute to increase in alpha diversity, but also to extended species distributional range.","[Tyagi, Vidit] Dolphin PG Inst Biomed & Nat Sci, Dehra Dun 248007, India; [Singh, Surendra P.] Cent Himalayan Environm Assoc CHEA, Dehra Dun 248007, India; [Singh, Ripu Daman; Gumber, Surabhi] Kumaun Univ, Dept Forestry & Environm Sci, DSB Campus, Naini Tal 263001, India; [Thadani, Rajesh] Ctr Ecol Dev & Res CEDAR, A17 Mayfair Gardens, New Delhi 110016, India; [Pandey, Rajiv] Indian Council Forestry Res & Educ ICFRE, Dehra Dun 248007, India",,"Singh, SP (corresponding author), Cent Himalayan Environm Assoc CHEA, Dehra Dun 248007, India.",drtyagi2007@gmail.com; surps@yahoo.com; ripuds4777@gmail.com; surabhigumber19@gmail.com; thadani_rajesh@hotmail.com; rajivfri@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2023,20.0,9,,,,,2592,2602,,10.1007/s11629-023-7967-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-023-7967-z,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001080350100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Banj oak forests have high biodiversity, soil organic matter, and water holding capacity that supports human well-being. Climate variability coupled with anthropogenic pressure has affected the regeneration and succession patterns in these forests. Conservation of Banj oak is a socio-ecological challenge and will require an interdisciplinary approach. In the present study, we have assessed the impact of climate variability on the ecological niche ofQ. leucotrichophorausing the Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt). The occurrence locations of the tree species were obtained from primary survey and published works (1984 to 2018). CMIP5 (Couple Model Inter-comparison Project)-derived bioclimatic variables were used as predictor variables in the modeling. The predictions were done following four IPCC RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenarios for the future periods of 2050 and 2070. Our results show that the estimated potential habitats of theQ. leucotrichophoraare likely to decline by 84-99%. Shift of the species from its present habitats due to climate variability reflects unusual patterns and demands climate adaptive management for forest landscape restoration (FLR) through active community involvement in the region.

For this purpose, AOD data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, MOD-L3), Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), India, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) were analyzed. Aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) was assessed using the atmospheric radiation transfer model (RTM) integrated into AERONET inversion code based on the Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (DISORT) module. Further, air mass trajectory over the entire IHR was analyzed using a hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. We estimated that between 2001 and 2015, the monthly average ARF at the surface (ARFSFC), top of the atmosphere (ARFTOA), and atmosphere (ARFATM) were -89.6 +/- 18.6 Wm(-2), -25.2 +/- 6.8 Wm(-2), and +64.4 +/- 16.5 Wm(-2), respectively. We observed that during dust aerosol transport days, the ARFSFC and TOA changed by -112.2 and -40.7 Wm(-2), respectively, compared with low aerosol loading days, thereby accounting for the decrease in the solar radiation by 207% reaching the surface. This substantial decrease in the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface increases the heating rate in the atmosphere by 3.1-fold, thereby acting as an additional forcing factor for accelerated melting of the snow and glacier resources of the IHR.","[Chand, Kesar] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm NIHE, North East Reg Ctr, Itanagar 791113, Arunachal Prade, India; [Kuniyal, Jagdish Chandra] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm NIHE, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India; [Kanga, Shruti] Suresh GyanVihar Univ, Ctr Climate Change & Water Res, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India; [Guleria, Raj Paul] Govt Himachal Pradesh, Directorate Higher Educ Shimla, Shimla 171001, Himachal Prades, India; [Meraj, Gowhar; Farooq, Majid] Govt Jammu & Kashmir, Dept Ecol Environm & Remote Sensing, Srinagar 190018, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Kumar, Pankaj] Inst Global Environm Strategies, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan; [Singh, Suraj Kumar] Suresh Gyan Vihar Univ, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India; [Nathawat, Mahendra Singh] Indira Gandhi Natl Open Univ IGNOU, Dept Geog, Maidan Garhi Rd, New Delhi 110068, India; [Sahu, Netrananda] Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Dept Geog, Delhi 110007, India; [Kumar, Raj] Govt Degree Coll Jukhala, Dept Phys, Bilaspur 174001, Himachal Prades, India",,"Kuniyal, JC (corresponding author), GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm NIHE, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India.;Kumar, P (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm Strategies, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan.",kesar.chand@gbpihed.nic.in; jckuniyal@gbpihed.nic.in; shruti.kanga@mygyanvihar.com; rpguleria_raj@yahoo.com; gowharmeraj@gmail.com; kumar@iges.or.jp; majid_rsgis@yahoo.com; suraj.kumar@mygyanvihar.com; msnathawat@ignou.ac.in; nsahu@geography.du.ac.in; rkb.66@redifmail.com,,,,,,,,8.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,14.0,1,,,,,,,179,10.3390/su14010179,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14010179,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000742470800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data was gathered from multiple sources, field investigations, literatures, and herbarium specimens. Altogether, 303 vascular plant species were reported from Manang. We used a published data to calculate distribution range of each species by interpolating between its upper and lower elevation limits. The relationship between elevation and species richness is elucidated by generalized linear model. The consequence of global warming upon Manang's vascular plant species was estimated based on projected temperature change for next century and adiabatic lapse rate along the elevation gradient of the Himalayas. The vascular plant species richness has a unimodel relationship with elevation along the whole elevation gradient of Nepal as well as in three biogeographical regions of Nepal. Vascular plants of Manang are found distributed from low land Terai to high alpine regions of Nepal and their elevation distribution range varies from 200 to 4700 m. Out of 303 vascular plants of Manang, only seven species might be affected if temperature increase by 1.5A degrees C, whereas at least 70 species will be affected with Received: 3 March 2015 Accepted: 17 July 2015 5A degrees C temperature increased. However, the majority of species (233 species) have wider distribution range (> 1000 m) and more than 5A degrees C temperature tolerance range, thus they are likely to be less affected from global warming by the end of 21(st) century.","[Subedi, Suresh Chandra] Florida Int Univ, Earth & Environm Dept, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Bhattarai, Khem Raj] Natl Herbarium & Plant Labs, Dept Plant Resources, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Bhattarai, Khem Raj] Minist Forest & Soil Conservat, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Chauudhary, Ram Prasad] Tribhuvan Univ, Res Ctr Appl Sci & Technol, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Subedi, SC (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Earth & Environm Dept, 11200 SW 8th St, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",ssube001@fiu.edu; bhattaraikhemraj@gmail.com; ram@cdbtu.wlink.com.np,,,,,,,,11.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2015,12.0,6,,,,,1345,1354,,10.1007/s11629-015-3495-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-015-3495-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000365269200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Then, the selected copulas were used to find joint distributions of the studied time series. In the next stage, the degrees of synchronous and asynchronous occurrence of, respectively, the annual maximum (AMAXF) and mean annual flows (MAF) were calculated. The study revealed that correlations between the flows in selected gauge stations were very strong and statistically significant. These results were confirmed by the synchronicity analysis carried out with the help of the copula functions. The highest relationship was detected in the case of gauges Besham Qila and Kachura on the Indus mainstream, while the lowest was detected in gauges Besham Qila and Naltar on the Naltar River.

Therefore, accurate estimations of glacier mass balances with high spatial (large region) and temporal (annual, seasonal) resolutions are very important. However, the estimation of glacial mass balances in mountainous regions is usually hampered by remoteness and the lack of high-precision topographic data for most mountain ranges. This study presents a novel method for estimating mass changes in mountain glaciers using InSAR data. We utilised observations of glacier surface deformation to derive changes in thickness, and then calculated the mass change. This method can accurately estimate short-term mass changes. We apply this method to the Koxkar glacier in the Tien Shan Mountain Range in China and successfully estimate the seasonal mass change. Using theoretical error and statistical error analysis, we determined that the accuracy of this method is much better than other geodetic methods. We analyse the spatial characteristics of the mass changes in the ablation zone for the first time. The results show considerable spatial and seasonal variability, which were mainly from ablation in the summer, with the greatest amount of glacial ablation reaching up to -3872mm water equivalent (w.e.), and from accumulation in the winter.","[Zhou, Jianmin; Fu, Xiyou; Tian, Bangsen; Qiao, Dejing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jianmin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, 9 Dengzhuang South Rd, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhen; Huang, Lei; Chen, Quan; Zhang, Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Airborne Remote Sensing Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Dejing] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Geol & Environm, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Zhou, JM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Zhou, JM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, 9 Dengzhuang South Rd, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",zhoujm@radi.ac.cn,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2019,78.0,3,,,,,,,77,10.1007/s12665-019-8075-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8075-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000457144900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To clarify the climatic importance of regional secondary particle formation in the Himalayas, data from 2005 to 2010 of continuous aerosol measurements at a high-altitude (2180 m) Indian Himalayan site, Mukteshwar, were analyzed. For this period, the days were classified, and the particle formation and growth rates were calculated for clear new particle formation (NPF) event days. The NPF events showed a pronounced seasonal cycle. The frequency of the events peaked in spring, when the ratio between event and non-event days was 53 %, whereas the events were truly sporadic on any other seasons. The annual mean particle formation and growth rates were 0.40 cm(-3) s(-1) and 2.43 nm h(-1), respectively. The clear annual cycle was found to be mainly controlled by the seasonal evolution of the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) height together with local meteorological conditions. Spring NPF events were connected with increased PBL height, and therefore characterised as boundary layer events, while the rare events in other seasons represented lower free tropospheric particle formation. This provides insight on the vertical extent of NPF in the atmosphere.","[Neitola, K.; Asmi, E.; Hyvarinen, A-P; Raatikainen, T.; Lihavainen, H.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Komppula, M.] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Kuopio, Finland; [Raatikainen, T.] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Panwar, T.

Available data are generally fragmented and scattered with different organizations and mostly cover the valleys. Here, we combine most of the available station data with the indirect precipitation estimates at the accumulation zones of major glaciers to analyse altitudinal dependency of precipitation in the high-altitude Indus basin. The available observations signified the importance of orography in each sub-hydrological basin but could not infer an accurate distribution of precipitation with altitude. We used Kriging with External Drift (KED) interpolation scheme with elevation as a predictor to appraise spatiotemporal distribution of mean monthly, seasonal and annual precipitation for the period of 1998-2012. The KED-based annual precipitation estimates are verified by the corresponding basin-wide observed specific runoffs, which show good agreement. In contrast to earlier studies, our estimates reveal substantially higher precipitation in most of the sub-basins indicating two distinct rainfall maxima; 1st along southern and lower most slopes of Chenab, Jhelum, Indus main and Swat basins, and 2nd around north-west corner of Shyok basin in the central Karakoram. The study demonstrated that the selected gridded precipitation products covering this region are prone to significant errors. In terms of quantitative estimates, ERA-Interim is relatively close to the observations followed by WFDEI and TRMM, while APHRODITE gives highly underestimated precipitation estimates in the study area. Basin-wide seasonal and annual correction factors introduced for each gridded dataset can be useful for lumped hydrological modelling studies, while the estimated precipitation distribution can serve as a basis for bias correction of any gridded precipitation products for the study area.

Given the history of extensive usage of organochlorine pesticides and increasing industrialization along the banks of these rivers we investigated selected organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the surface water of River Brahmaputra and River Hooghly. Geomean of Sigma OCPs (53 ng L-1) and Sigma(19)PCBs (108 ng L-1) was higher in RH compared with geomean of Sigma OCPs (24 ng L-1) and Sigma(19)PCBs (77 ng L-1) in RB. Among OCPs, gamma-HCH showed maximum detection frequency in both the rivers reflecting ongoing lindane usage. DDT and endosulfan residues were observed at specific locations where past or ongoing sources exist. Elevated concentrations of heavier congeners (penta-hepta) were observed in those sites along RH where port and industrial activities were prevalent including informal electronic waste scrap processing units. Furthermore along River Hooghly PCB-126 was high in the suburban industrial belt of Howrah district. PCBs were found to be ubiquitously distributed in RB. Atmospheric transport of tri- and tetra-PCB congeners from the primary source regions might be a major contributor for PCBs in RB. Heavier congeners (penta-nona) in the urban centers of RB were likely due to industrial wastewater runoff from the oil refineries in the Brahmaputra valley. Sigma(19)PCBs concentrations in this study exceeded the USEPA recommended limit for freshwater. Ecotoxicological risk assessment showed the possibility of adverse impact on the organisms in the lower trophic level due to DDT and lindane contamination.

Land-use changes and their correlations could elucidate conditions that put forests at risk of conversion to other land uses. The impact of rapid forest cover change tends to reduce the percentage of forest cover, thereby reducing the potential for carbon storage in woody biomass. The study was conducted in the state of Arunachal Pradesh to estimate the above-ground biomass, carbon pool and sequestration potential of major land-use sectors. The above-ground biomass of selected land-uses viz. dense forest, moderately dense forest, open forest, plantations, Jhum >5 years, Jhum <5 years and current jhum are 332.28 t ha(-1), 246.63 t ha(-1), 145.36 t ha(-1), 179.31 t ha(-1), 149.63 t ha(-1), 55.40 t ha(-1), 16.84 t ha(-1) respectively. The developed model is derived from Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) for prediction of above-ground biomass (AGB) (R (2) = 0.85, p < 0.05). The resultant R (2) value of 85% predicts that 79% of accuracy could be assumed by the model. The RMSE of the model was 53.21 t ha(-1), having no multicollinearity problem keeping tolerance (0.49) and VIF (2.80). The spatial AGB density map was predicted using a step-wise linear regression model which used AGB, SAVI and ARVI of the corresponding sample plot location. The implication of the land-use change revealed that about 84% carbon will be lost from dense forest once it is converted to Jhum (Jhum is the alternate name of Shifting cultivation in India) followed by Jhum <5 years (65%). It is pertinent to mention here that, the present analysis will help the policymakers in visualizing a proper developmental goal to regulate land-use changes for achieving the higher carbon stock and maintaining balance in the global climate scenario.","[Das, Bisawjit; Bordoloi, Reetashree; Deka, Sangeeta; Paul, Ashish; Tripathi, Om Prakash] North Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol Deemed Univ, Dept Forestry, Nirjuli 791109, Arunachal Prade, India; [Pandey, Pankaj Kumar] North Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol Deemed Univ, Dept Agr Engn, Nirjuli, Arunachal Prade, India; [Singha, Lal Bihari] Manipur Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Bot, Imphal, Manipur, India; [Tripathi, Om Prakash; Mishra, Bhanu Prakash] Mizoram Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Aizawl, Mizoram, India; [Mishra, Madhusudan] North Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol Deemed Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Nirjuli, Arunachal Prade, India",,"Das, B (corresponding author), North Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol Deemed Univ, Dept Forestry, Nirjuli 791109, Arunachal Prade, India.",biswajitdas.19.1989@gmail.com,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 8,2021,12.0,2,,,,,201,214,,10.1080/17583004.2021.1899753,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2021.1899753,,MAR 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000634130500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One of the significant adverse implications of the rapidly changing urban LULC is the increase in the Land Surface Temperature (LST) resulting in the urban heat island effect. In this study, we used a time series of Landsat satellite images from 1992 to 2020 in the Srinagar city of the Kashmir valley, North-western Himalaya, India to understand the linkages between LULC dynamics and LST, derived from the archived images using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Furthermore, the relationship between LST, urban heat island (UHI), and biophysical indices, i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), was also analysed. LULC change detection analysis from 1992 to 2020 revealed that the built-up area has increased significantly from 12% in 1992 to 40% in 2020, while the extent of water bodies has decreased from 6% in 1992 to 4% in 2020. The area under plantations has decreased from 26% in 1992 to 17% in 2020, and forests have decreased from 4 to 2% during the same period. Urban sprawl of Srinagar city has resulted in the depletion of natural land covers, modification of natural drainage, and loss of green and blue spaces over the past four decades. The study revealed that the maximum LST in the city has increased by 11 & DEG;C between 1992 and 2020. During the same period of time, the minimum LST in the city has increased by 5 & DEG;C, indicating the impact of urbanization on the city environment, which is reflected by the observed changes in various environmental indices. UHI impact in the city is quite evident with the maximum LST at the city centre having increased from 13.03 & DEG;C in 1992 to 22.01 & DEG;C in 2020.

This paper provides the first comprehensive description of climatic conditions in Bhutan. It assesses the spatial variation of temperature and precipitation across the country and evaluates the causes for this variation based on daily data from 70 meteorological stations that have been recording data for time spans ranging from 3 to 21 years. Temperature and precipitation show contrasting spatial variation, with temperature primarily affected by elevation and precipitation by latitude. Models were developed using mixed linear regression models to predict seasonal and annual mean temperature and precipitation based on geographical location. Using linear regression we found that temperatures changed by about 0.5 degrees C for every 100 m of change in elevation, with lapse rates being highest in February, March, and November and lowest from June to August. The lapse rate was highest for minimum temperatures and lowest for maximum temperatures, with the greatest difference during winter. The spatial distribution of precipitation was mainly controlled by latitude, having a quadratic relationship, with the highest rates in the southern foothills of the Himalayan range and the lowest at midlatitudes. The land cover is affected by topography and local climate, with variations in temperature being a main deciding factor for vegetation types; most human settlements and associated land uses are concentrated at lower elevations.","[Dorji, Ugyen; Olesen, Jorgen E.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, Blichers Alle 20, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark; [Dorji, Ugyen] Royal Univ Bhutan, Coll Nat Resources, Lobesa, Punakha, Bhutan; [Bocher, Peder K.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Bioscience, Ny Munkegade 114, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark; [Seidenkrantz, Marit Solveig] Aarhus Univ, Dept Geosci, Ctr Climate Studies, Hoegh Guldbergs Gade 2, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark",,"Dorji, U (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Dept Agroecol, Blichers Alle 20, DK-8830 Tjele, Denmark.;Dorji, U (corresponding author), Royal Univ Bhutan, Coll Nat Resources, Lobesa, Punakha, Bhutan.",ugyendorjikk@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,,28.0,29.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2016,36.0,1,,,,,66,79,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-15-00020.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-15-00020.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000377707300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigates the possibility of applying functional variables of ecosystem retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard sensor data to map the species distribution of two alpine treeline species, namely Betula utilis D.Don and Rhododendron campanulatum D.Don over the Himalayan biodiversity hotspot. In this study, we have developed forty-nine Novel Earth Observation Variables (NEOVs) from MODIS products, an asset to the present investigation. To determine the effectiveness and ecological significance of NEOVs combinations, we built and compared four different models, namely, a bioclimatic model (BCM) with bioclimatic predictor variables, a phenology model (PhenoM) with earth observation derived phenological predictor variables, a biophysical model (BiophyM) with earth observation derived biophysical predictor variables, and a hybrid model (HM) with a combination of selected predictor variables from BCM, PhenoM, and BiophyM. All models utilized topographical variables by default. Models that include NEOVs were competitive for focal species, and models without NEOVs had considerably poor model performance and explanatory strength. To ascertain the accurate predictions, we assessed the congruence of predictions by pairwise comparisons of their performance. Among the three machine learning algorithms tested (artificial neural networks, generalised boosting model, and maximum entropy), maximum entropy produced the most promising predictions for BCM, PhenoM, BiophyM, and HM. Area under curve (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS) scores for the BCM, PhenoM, BiophyM, and HM models derived from maximum entropy were AUC >= 0.9 and TSS >= 0.6 for the focal species. The overall investigation revealed the competency of NEOVs in the accurate prediction of species' fundamental niches, but conventional bioclimatic variables were unable to achieve such a level of precision. A principal component analysis of environmental spaces disclosed that niches of focal species substantially overlapped each other. We demonstrate that the use of satellite onboard sensors' biotic and abiotic variables with species occurrence data can provide precision and resolution for species distribution mapping at a scale that is relevant ecologically and at the operational scale of most conservation and management actions.","[Satish, K.

Snow leopards inhabit the alpine zone between snow line and tree line, which contracts and expands greatly during glacier-interglacial cycles. Here we assess impacts of climate change on global snow leopard habitat from the last glacial maximum (LGM; 21 kyr ago) to the late 21st century. Based on occurrence records of snow leopards collected across all snow leopard range countries from 1983 to 2015, we built a snow leopard habitat model using the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt 3.3.3k). Then we projected this model into LGM, mid-Holocene and 2070. Analysis of snow leopard habitat map from LGM to 2070 indicates that three large patches of stable habitat have persisted from the LGM to present in the Altai, Qilian, and Tian Shan-Pamir-Hindu Kush-Karakoram mountain ranges, and are projected to persist through the late 21st century. These climatically suitable areas account for about 35% of the snow leopard's current extent, are large enough to support viable populations, and should function as refugia for snow leopards to survive through both cold and warm periods. Existence of these refugia is largely due to the unique mountain environment in High Asia, which maintains a relatively constant arid or semi-arid climate. However, habitat loss leading to fragmentation in the Himalaya and Hengduan Mountains, as well as increasing human activities, will present conservation challenges for snow leopards and other sympatric species.

The coseismic deformation has been well documented by previous studies using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. However, due to some limitations of spatially sparse GPS stations and InSAR only-one-dimensional observation in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction, the complete distribution and detailed spatial variation of the three-dimensional surface deformation field are still not fully understood. In this study, we reconstructed the three-dimensional coseismic deformation fields using multi-view InSAR observations and investigated the refined surface deformation characteristics during this event. We firstly obtained four ascending and descending InSAR coseismic deformation maps from both Sentinel-1A/B and ALOS-2 data. Secondly, we obtained the synthetic north-south deformation field from our best-fitting slip distribution inversions. Finally, we calculated three-dimensional deformation fields, which were consistent with coseismic GPS displacements but with higher resolution. We found that the surface deformation is dominated by horizontal southward motion and vertical uplift and subsidence, with minor east-west deformation. In the north-south direction, the whole deformation area reaches at least 150 x 150 km with a maximum displacement of similar to 1.5 m. In the vertical direction, two areas, including uplift in the south and subsidence in the north, are mapped with a peak displacement of 1.5 and -1.0 m, respectively. East-west deformation presented a four-quadrant distribution with a maximum displacement of similar to 0.6 m.

The index consists of household parameters of all the three dimensions of vulnerability such as Exposure, Sensitivity and Adaptive Capability. Exposure is defined by 'Natural disaster and Climate variability', however Sensitivity by 'Health', Food', and 'Water' and Adaptive Capability by 'Socio-demographic profile', 'Livelihood strategies', and 'Social networks'. Respective parameters were based on the peers and literature. The CVI vulnerable status ranges from high (0) to low (1). Household questionnaire survey was undertaken from two regions namely, near to district (NDH) and away to district (ADH), in Srinagar, Uttrakhand, India. Data for desired parameters for CVI was collected from 50 randomly selected households. Data were aggregated using a composite index and differential vulnerabilities were compared. High vulnerability was observed for livelihood strategies, food and natural disaster for ADH households, and health and water for NDH households. It was found that the adaptive capability and sensitivity of ADH households was higher than NDH, however, exposure realization was similar in both the regions. The CVI was 0.69 and 0.64 for NDH and ADH, respectively, suggests high vulnerability to NDH households. This pragmatic CVI approach may be used to assess and monitor vulnerability under various stress condition, and/or evaluate potential program/ policy effectiveness in various data-scarce regions by comparing various anticipated scenarios with baseline.

IN HIMACHAL PRADESH, INDIA: AN ENDANGERED PINE OF HIGH EDIBLE VALUE",APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Pinus gerardiana Wall. locally known as 'chilgoza' is near endemic and endangered to Himalayan region. The species has aptly been described as the Champion of Rocky Mountains as it grows under extremely rough site conditions. Being a flavorsome wild edible, the chilgoza pine nuts have high demand in local, national and international markets and fetch very high prices. Due to rampant harvesting of cones, natural regeneration of this species is being fatally hampered. In present study, the natural regeneration assessment of the species was conducted in the forests of Kinnuar of Himachal Pradesh, India. The whole distribution area of the species was divided into three zones, viz., Dry temperate, Semi arid and Arid. The sampling plots of 20m x 20m were selected in which the regeneration sampling quadrates of 2m x 2m were laid in the eastern and western bank of river Sutlej. The results revealed that the semiarid zone on the western aspect of the area have maximum established regeneration of the species (291.66 plants/ha). Overall, the mean natural regeneration status of the species was very poor (15%). Thus, the species is facing higher risk of extinction and needs to be considered as 'Critically Endangered' in Indian Himalayan Region. It is suggested here that a suitable strategy and action plan including sustainable harvesting methods should be prepared and implemented on priority basis.","[Malik, A.

Soil C plays a crucial role in securing food and livelihood security for the Himalayan population besides maintaining the ecological balance in the Indian Himalayas. However, soil C is being severely depleted due to anthropogenic activities. It is well known that land use management strongly impacted the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and also regulates the atmospheric C chemistry. Different types of cultivation practices, i.e., forest, plantations, and crops in the Kashmir Himalayas, India, has different abilities to conserve SOC and emit C in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). Hence, five prominent land use systems (LUC) (e.g., natural forest, natural grassland, maize-field-converted from the forest, plantation, and paddy crop) of Kashmir Himalaya were evaluated to conserve SOC, reduce C emissions, improve soil properties and develop understanding SOC pools and its fractions variations under different land use management practices. The results revealed that at 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm profile, the soil under natural forest conserved the highest total organic carbon (TOC, 24.24 g kg(-1) and 18.76 g kg(-1)), Walkley-black carbon (WBC, 18.23 g kg(-1) and 14.10 g kg(-1)), very-labile-carbon (VLC, 8.65 g kg(-1), and 6.30 g kg(-1)), labile-carbon (LC, 3.58 g kg(-1) and 3.14 g kg(-1)), less-labile-carbon (VLC, 2.59 g kg(-1), and 2.00 g kg(-1)), non-labile-carbon (NLC, 3.41 g kg(-1) and 2.66 g kg-1), TOC stock (45.88 Mg ha(-1) and 41.16 Mg ha(-1)), WBC stock (34.50 Mg ha(-1) and 30.94 Mg ha(-1)), active carbon pools (AC, 23.14 Mg ha(-1) and 20.66 Mg ha(-1)), passive carbon pools (PC, 11.40 Mg ha(-1) and 10.26 Mg ha(-1)) and carbon management index (CMI, 100), followed by the natural grassland. However, the lowest C storage was reported in paddy cropland. The soils under natural forest and natural grassland systems had a greater amount of VLC, LC, LLC, and NLC fraction than other land uses at both depths. On the other hand, maize-field-converted-from-forest-land-use soils had a higher proportion of NLC fraction than paddy soils; nonetheless, the NLC pool was maximum in natural forest soil. LUS based on forest crops maintains more SOC, while agricultural crops, such as paddy and maize, tend to emit more C in the Himalayan region. Therefore, research findings suggest that SOC under the Kashmir Himalayas can be protected by adopting suitable LUS, namely forest soil protection, and by placing some areas under plantations. The areas under the rice and maize fields emit more CO2, hence, there is a need to adopt the conservation effective measure to conserve the SOC without compromising farm productivity.","[Kumar, Shamal Shasang; Wani, Owais Ali; Mir, Shakeel Ahmad; Chesti, Majeed Ul Hassan; Baba, Zahoor Ahmad; Sofi, Parvaze Ahmad; Wani, Fehim Jeelani; Dar, Shahnawaz Rasool] Sher E Ekashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol Kashmir, Srinagar, India; [Babu, Subhash] Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Agron, ICAR, New Delhi, India; [Sharma, Vikas] Sher E Ekashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol Jammu, Jammu, India; [Singh, Raghavendra] Indian Inst Pulses Res, ICAR, Kanpur, India; [Yadav, Devideen] Indian Inst Soil & Water Conservat ICAR, ICAR, Dehra Dun, India",,"Wani, OA (corresponding author), Sher E Ekashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol Kashmir, Srinagar, India.;Babu, S (corresponding author), Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Agron, ICAR, New Delhi, India.",owaisaliwani@skuastkashmir.ac.in; subhiari@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 9,2022,10.0,,,,,,,,1009660,10.3389/fenvs.2022.1009660,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.1009660,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000898181500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite most OCPs have been banned, they are still reported to be used in developing countries, including Pakistan. We aimed to identify the distribution, origin, mobility, and potential risks from OCPs in three major environmental compartments, i.e., air, water, and soil, across Azad Jammu and Kashmir valley, Pakistan. The sums of OCPs ranged between 66 and 530pg/g in soil, 5 and 13pg/L in surface water, and 14 and 191pg/m3 in air, respectively. The highest sum of OCPs was observed in the downstream zone of a river that was predominantly influenced by peri-urban and urban areas. The OCP isomers ratios (-HCH/-HCH and o,p-DDT/p,p-DDT) indicate use of lindane and technical DDTs mixture as a source of HCH and DDT in the riverine environment. Similarly, the ratios of DDE and DDD/the sum of DDTs, -endosulfan/-endosulfan, and cis-chlordane/trans-chlordane indicate recent use of DDTs, endosulfan, and chlordane in the region. The air-water exchange fugacity ratios indicate net volatilization (fw/fa >1) of -endosulfan and trans-chlordane, and net deposition (fw/fa <1) of -endosulfan, -HCH, -HCH p,p-DDD, p,p-DDE, and p,p-DDT. Based on the risk quotient (RQ) method, we consider the acute ecological risks for fish associated with the levels of OCPs as negligible.

The determination of MZs is based on several factors, including crop, soil, climate, and terrain characteristics. This study aims to delineate MZs by means of geostatistical and fuzzy clustering algorithms considering remotely sensed and laboratory data and, subsequently, to compare the zone maps in the north-eastern Himalayan region of India. For this study, 896 grid-wise representative soil samples (0-25 cm depth) were collected from the study area (1615 km(2)). The soils were analysed for soil reaction (pH), soil organic carbon and available macro (N, P and K) and micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu). The predicted soil maps were developed using regression kriging, where 28 digital elevation model-derived terrain attributes and two vegetation derivatives were used as environmental covariates. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error were used to evaluate the model's performance. The predicted soil parameters were accurate, and regression kriging identified the highest variability for the majority of the soil variables. Further, to define the management zones, the geographically weighted principal component analysis and possibilistic fuzzy c-means clustering method were employed, based on which the optimum clusters were identified by employing fuzzy performance index and normalized classification entropy. The management zones were constructed considering the total pixel points of 30 m spatial resolution (17, 86,985 data points). The area was divided into four distinct zones, which could be differently managed. MZ 1 covers the maximum (43.3%), followed by MZ 2 (29.4%), MZ 3 (27.0%) and MZ 4 (0.3%). The MZs map thus would not only serve as a guide for judicious location-specific nutrient management, but would also help the policymakers to bring sustainable changes in the north-eastern Himalayan region of India.","[Jena, Roomesh Kumar; Roy, Partha Deb; Ghosh, Dibakar; Das, Bachaspati] Indian Inst Water Management, ICAR, Bhubaneswar 751023, India; [Bandyopadhyay, Siladitya; Ray, Sanjay Kumar] Natl Bur Soil Survey & Land Use Planning, Reg Ctr, ICAR, Kolkata 700091, India; [Pradhan, Upendra Kumar] Indian Agr Res Inst, ICAR, New Delhi 110012, India; [Moharana, Pravash Chandra; Kumar, Nirmal] Natl Bur Soil Survey & Land Use Planning, ICAR, Nagpur 440033, Maharashtra, India; [Sharma, Gulshan Kumar] Indian Inst Soil & Water Conservat, Res Ctr, ICAR, Kota 324002, India; [Ray, Prasenjit] Indian Agr Res Inst, ICAR, New Delhi 110012, India; [Padua, Shelton] Cent Marine Fisheries Res Inst, ICAR, Kochi 682018, India; [Ramachandran, Sundaram] Indian Inst Hort Res, ICAR, Bengaluru 560089, India; [Singh, Surendra Kumar] Cent Coastal Agr Res Inst, ICAR, Old Goa 403402, India; [Alsuhaibani, Amnah Mohammed] Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman Univ, Dept Phys Sport Sci, Coll Educ, POB 84428, Riyadh 11671, Saudi Arabia; [Gaber, Ahmed] Taif Univ, Dept Biol, Coll Sci, POB 11099, At Taif 21944, Saudi Arabia; [Hossain, Akbar] Bangladesh Wheat & Maize Res Inst, Dept Agron, Dinajpur 5200, Bangladesh",,"Hossain, A (corresponding author), Bangladesh Wheat & Maize Res Inst, Dept Agron, Dinajpur 5200, Bangladesh.",roomesh.jena@icar.gov.in; s.bandyopadhyay@icar.gov.in; upendra.pradhan@icar.gov.in; pravash.moharana@icar.gov.in; nirmal.kumar3@icar.gov.in; gulshan.sharma@icar.gov.in; partha.roy@icar.gov.in; dibakar.ghosh@icar.gov.in; prasenjit.ray@icar.gov.in; shelton.padua@icar.gov.in; s.ramachandran@icar.gov.in; bachaspati.das1@gmail.com; sk.singh1@icar.gov.in; sanjay.ray@icar.gov.in; amalsuhaibani@pnu.edu.sa; a.gaber@tu.edu.sa; akbar.hossain@bwmri.gov.bd,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2022,14.0,9,,,,,,,2101,10.3390/rs14092101,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14092101,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000794558000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The route also embraces a proposed site for 204 m high concrete gravity dam across River Yamuna near Lakhwar village with the aim of generation of 300 MW power. Several slide zones were identified and based on the discontinuity orientation, structural features and debris materials, they are recognised as planar, wedge or circular failure types. The morphological dimensions, structural data, orientations and geotechnical parameters of circular failure slides within weathered quartzites, phyllites and shales were evaluated by extensive field work and by laboratory tests for their stability analysis. Internal mechanisms, cohesion and angle of internal friction that resist shear stress in slope materials, obtained from direct shear test are showing minor variation due to relatively consistent grain size distribution and mineralogical composition. General slope is about 40 degrees-43 degrees with sparse vegetation. Materials in and around slide zones are sands with appreciable amount of fines falling in SP- SM category as per Unified Soil Classification System (USCS), except Niste B slide which has clean sands lying in SP group. Factor of safety, computed by requisite parameters of strength, soil and slope properties in circular failure charts, varies from 1.02 to 1.23 in dry conditions while it reduces below unity with increasing saturation, representing stable conditions in dry conditions but with seepage and saturation along the cracks and discontinuities during rainfall make them unstable. Presence of steep slopes, proximity to stream channels and significant weathered and jointed area are causative factors in the route with rainfall and road widening as major triggers initiating the failure.","[Dudeja, Divya; Bhatt, S.

Total density and basal area values for tree species located at higher elevations were lower than those in the middle and low elevation communities for all the species. We found that P. roxburghii had unimodal size distributions, suggesting that these populations are not at equilibrium and are changing over time. CCA-Ordination with the associated Monte Carlo permutation test was employed to explore the patterns of variation in vegetation distribution and identified elevation and soil organic matter as the most influential variables responsible for the changes in species composition. The MaxEnt predictive modeling results clearly indicate a significant difference in the present predicated inter-site floristic composition and distribution of the species, suggesting an overall restriction to the south, whereas, the future distribution model suggest a shift towards the neighbouring districts in the west. This study identified few significantly important environmental variables linked with P. roxburghii associations and their distribution across the study area.

The region is trending towards water scarcity as well as quality deterioration stage due to its highly unregulated development. The existence of few literature on various aspects of the basin prompts us to study the spatio-temporal variability of its physicochemical parameters and thereby to understand the regulating hydrogeochemical mechanisms based on 50 samples collected during high flow (June 2008) and low flow (January 2009) periods. The water chemistry exhibited significant spatial variability reflecting the mixing processes in the basin. The seasonal effect does change the concentration of ions significantly with modest variability in the order of ionic abundance. The Ca2+ ion among cations and HCO3- ion among anions dominate the ionic budget and correlates significantly with the diverse lithology of the basin. Three major water types, i.e., Ca-Mg-HCO3 (72 %), Ca-HCO3 (12 %), and Mg-Ca-HCO3 (16 %), suggest that the chemical composition of water is dominantly controlled by carbonate lithology, besides a significant contribution from silicates. However, at certain sites, the biological processes and anthropogenic activities play a major role. Relatively, the lower ionic concentration during high flow period (summer season) suggested the significant influence of higher discharge via dilution effect. The higher discharge due to higher rainfall and snow melting in response to rising temperature in this period leads to strong flushing of human and agricultural wastes into the river. The factor analysis also reflected the dominant control of varied lithology and anthropogenic sources on the water quality based on the four significant factors explaining collectively about 70-81 % of the total data variance. A two-member chloride mixing model used to estimate the discharge contribution of tributaries to the main river channel showed reliable results. It may be mentioned that the regular and continuous contamination through anthropogenic sources is likely to jeopardize and degrade the water quality in the near future. Thus, critical management approaches and strategies are very imperative for its future sustainability.","[Mir, Riyaz Ahmad] Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mir, Riyaz Ahmad] Geol Survey India, State Unit J&K, Srinagar 190008, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Jeelani, Gh; Dar, Farooq Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Mir, RA (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Roorkee, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.;Mir, RA (corresponding author), Geol Survey India, State Unit J&K, Srinagar 190008, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",riyazgsi@gmail.com,,,,,,,,28.0,28.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2016,188.0,7,,,,,,,438,10.1007/s10661-016-5429-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5429-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000378840300055,View Full Record in Web of Science

Surface soil samples (n = 69) collected from IHR were analysed for 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) listed by USEPA. The Sigma(16)PAH concentration in surface soil ranged from 15.3 to 4762 ngg(-1) (mean 458 ngg(-1)). The sum total of low molecular weight PAH (Sigma LMW-PAHs) (mean 74.0 ngg(-1)) were relatively lower than the high molecular weight PAH (Sigma HMW-PAHs) (mean 384 ngg(-1)). The concentration of eight carcinogenic PAHs (BaA, CHR, BbF, BkF, BaP, DahA, IcdP, BghiP) were detected high in mountain soil from IHR and ranged from 0.73 to 2729 ngg(-1) (mean 272 ngg(-1)). Based on spatial distribution map, high concentration of HMW- and LMW-PAHs were detected at GS1 site in Guwahati (615 and 4071 ngg(-1)), and lowest concentration of HMW-PAHs were found at IS6 in Itanagar (5.80 ngg(-1)) and LMW-PAHs at DS2 (17.3 ngg(-1)) in Dibrugarh. Total organic carbon (TOC) in mountain soil was poorly connected with Sigma PAHs (r(2) = 0.072) and Car-PAHs (r(2) = 0.048), suggesting the little role of TOC in adsorption of PAHs. Isomeric ratio of PAHs showed the source of PAH contamination in IHR is mixed of petrogenic and pyrogenic origin and was affirmed by PAHs composition profile. These source apportionment results were further confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA). Eco-toxicological analysis showed the calculated TEQ for most carcinogenic PAH were 2-4 times more than the Dutch allowed limit, while TEQ of BaP was 25 times high, suggesting increasing trend of carcinogenicity of surface soil.

The chemical and isotopic composition of aerosols revealed significant anthropogenic influence over this remote free-troposphere site. The amount of total carbon and nitrogen and their isotopic composition suggest a considerable contribution of biomass burning to the aerosols during winter. On the other hand, fossil fuel combustion sources are found to be dominant during summer. The carbon aerosol in winter is characterized by greater isotope ratios (av. -24.0 aEuro degrees), mostly originated from biomass burning of C-4 plants. On the contrary, the aerosols in summer showed smaller delta C-13 values (-26.0 aEuro degrees), indicating that they are originated from vascular plants (mostly of C-3 plants). The secondary ions (i.e., SO4 (2-), NH4 (+), and NO3 (-)) were abundant due to the atmospheric reactions during long-range transport in both seasons. The water-soluble organic and inorganic compositions revealed that they are aged in winter but comparatively fresh in summer.

Our objective was to identify the most appropriate soil quality indicators and to evaluate the impact of six most prevalent land use types (natural forestland, cultivated lowland, cultivated upland terrace, shifting cultivation, plantation land, and grassland) on soil quality in eastern Himalayan region of India. We collected 120 soil samples (20 cm depth) and analyzed them for 29 physical, chemical, and biological soil attributes. For selection of soil quality indicators, principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the measured attributes, which provided four principal components (PC) with eigenvalues > 1 and explaining at least 5 % of the variance in dataset. The four PCs together explained 92.6 % of the total variance. Based on rotated factor loadings of soil attributes, selected indicators were: soil organic carbon (SOC) from PC-1, exchangeable Al from PC-2, silt content from PC-3, and available P and Mn from PC-4. Indicators were transformed into scores (linear scoring method) and soil quality index (SQI) was determined, on a scale of 0-1, using the weighting factors obtained from PCA. SQI rating was the highest for the least-disturbed sites, i.e., natural forestland (0.93) and grassland (0.87), and the lowest for the most intensively cultivated site, i.e., cultivated upland terrace (0.44). Ratings for the other land uses were shifting cultivation (0.60) > cultivated low land (0.57) > plantation land (0.54). Overall contribution (in percent) of the indicators in determination of SQI was in the order: SOC (58 %) > exch. Al (17.1 %) > available P (8.9 %) > available Mn (8.2 %) > silt content (7.8 %). Results of this study suggest SOC and exch. Al as the two most powerful indicators of soil quality in study area. Thus, organic C and soil acidity management holds the key to improve soil quality under many exploitatively cultivated land use systems in eastern Himalayan region of India.","[Singh, A.

Objectives: To compare species richness patterns of native and alien woody plants along an altitudinal gradient in Kashmir Himalaya, India, and to analyse the specific composition, e.g. proportion of life forms. Methods: Analysis of secondary data from published floristic inventories. The gradient (500-4800 m asl) was split into 100 m bands and presence/absence data for each species were obtained, for each band. Results: Species richness of both native and alien species followed a hump-shaped distribution. Alien species richness dropped faster above 2000 m asl than the native did. The ratio of trees to shrubs decreased monotonically along the gradient in native species, but showed a peak at c. 2500 m asl in alien species. Alien species flowered in average earlier than native species. Conclusions: The change of species richness of native and alien species along altitude is similar, but the proportion of life forms is not. Most likely both climatic and socio-economic factors affect alien species richness and its specific composition in the Kashmir Himalaya.

Inadequate data and lack of monitoring further exacerbate the situation. The surface water quality of one such hill stream, Neeru was evaluated for potability and irrigation quality. The water quality parameters were analysed at 25 sampling stations over a stretch of 30 km across four seasons during a 2-year study from January 2014 to December 2015. The CCME Water Quality Index (WQI) indicated excellent water quality in upstream stations, while the midstream and a few downstream stations revealed varying degrees of impaired water quality. Although the irrigation quality of the stream was excellent, pollution levels near urban areas were rather high, necessitating considerable treatment for human consumption. The factor analysis yielded seven components with Eigenvalues greater than one that accounted for 83.656% of the variance and enabled the grouping of selected parameters based on comparable characteristics. The hydrogeochemical characteristics of the water samples indicated that they lie within the zone of rock dominance, while the trilinear diagram depicted the Ca-bicarbonate rich stream water. The study concluded that the upstream stations revealed pristine water quality, which significantly degraded towards human settlements.

Previous studies estimated that Ganga River derives >65 % of its sediment load from the Higher Himalayas. The Alaknanda River is a headwater stream of the Ganga River and has a high sediment flux. In the present study, freshly deposited channel sediments were collected from the Alaknanda River and its tributaries during the post-monsoon, pre-monsoon, and monsoon seasons, and were analyzed for grain-size distribution, major oxides composition, magnetic susceptibility, and heavy-mineral assemblages. The results show that the channel sediments are mostly medium-to-coarse sand (56.4-930 mu m), uni-modal, and symmetrical to fine skewed in distribution. The presence of dams and reservoirs seemed to affect the natural grain-size distribution in the Alaknanda River. The average value of the chemical index of alteration of similar to 56 and weathering index of parker of similar to 43 indicates intense physical weathering in the basin. The magnetic susceptibility and heavy-mineral assemblages showed the effect of local lithology in controlling sediment composition. The principal component analysis on the major oxide composition of channel sediment shows that felsic, mafic, and carbonate weathering contribute to the high sediment load of the Alaknanda River. This study established that along with weathering of Higher Himalayan Crystallines, weathering of Garhwal Group (enriched in magnesite, dolomites, and mafic intrusion) is also a significant source of channel sediments in the Upper Ganga Basin.","[Panwar, S.; Chakrapani, G.

Groundwater (n = 9) and borehole sediments (n = 23) of different depths were collected randomly and analyzed for REEs using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Multivariate statistical techniques were applied to determine interrelationships among different REEs. Both water and sediments exhibit a higher content of light rare earth elements (LREEs) than heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), implying that source rock composition primarily controls the REE signatures of these river sediments, largely owing to variations in levels of chlorite and monazite, which are more abundant in bottom river sediments of the Brahmaputra. However, lower LREE/HREE ratios in groundwater samples (8.42-14.48) compared to sediments (8.9-52.6) suggest less dissolved phase mobilization of LREE during weathering and transport. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed more consistent clustering in sediment compared to water and clear demarcations of MREE, HREE and LREE were observed in the sediments. The primitive mantle-normalized REE patterns of borehole sediments were similar to the upper continental crust (UCC) and the compositions of average Himalayan rocks. LREE enrichment compared to HREE suggest dominance of a felsic source. However, a La/V versus Th/Yb plot suggests a small contribution from the mafic source component. The sediments show high Th/Sc (>1 of UCC) and high Zr/Sc. A Eu/Eu* verses Gd-N/Yb-N plot suggests that the dominant source with Upper crustal composition has undergone multiple recycling.

Methodology : A total of 153 lactating mothers were selected from four agro-1 climatic zones varying from subtropics to dry temperate high hills for residue analysis. The extraction and cleanup were performed by QuEChERS method. Residue were analysed by Shimadzu 2010 GC equipped. with a Ni-60 ECD and confirmed by Shimadzu QP 2010 Plus GC-MS through selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode.

On the basis of canopy cover and frequency of disturbances (%), the studied forests were divided into highly disturbed (HD), moderately disturbed (MD) and least disturbed (LD) categories. The HD forests had the lowest canopy cover, lowest density and lowest TBC and the LD had the highest canopy cover, highest density and highest TBC. The MD forests occupied the intermediate position with respect to these parameters. Species richness was least in HD forests, highest in one of the MD forests while LD forest occupied an intermediate position. The percentage of regenerating species was lowest (54%) in HD and highest (72%) in MD. The density of seedlings and saplings was higher in one of the MD forests as compared to HD and LD. We concluded that the moderate disturbances do not affect the vegetation adversely; however the increased degree of disturbance causes loss in plant diversity; affects regeneration and changes community characteristics. Construction of hydroelectric projects at various places in the study area was found to be one of the most important sources of anthropogenic disturbances in addition to the routine anthropogenic disturbances like grazing, fuelwood collection and fodder extraction. If all proposed dams in the Indian Himalaya are constructed combined with weak national environmental impact assessment and implementation, it will result in a significant loss of species. Therefore, various agents of disturbances should be evaluated in cumulative manner and any developmental activities such as hydropower projects, which trigger various natural and anthropogenic disturbances, should be combined with proper cumulative environmental impact assessment and effective implementation to minimise the anticipated loss of vegetation.","[Malik, Zubair A.; Bhatt, Ajay Ballabh] HNB Garhwal Univ Srinagar Garhwal, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Ecol Lab, Uttarakhand 246174, India; [Pandey, Rajiv] HNB Garhwal Univ Srinagar Garhwal, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Uttarakhand 246174, India",,"Malik, ZA (corresponding author), Govt Degree Coll, Dept Bot, Beerwah Budgam 193411, J&K, India.",malikmzubair081@gmail.com; rajivfri@yahoo.com; bhattab2011@gmail.com,,,,,,,,40.0,42.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2016,13.0,1,,,,,69,82,,10.1007/s11629-015-3533-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-015-3533-7,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000368175700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This geomorphic process is often accelerated by climatic condition and human activities which changes this natural process to a quasi-natural hazard. Current research work tries to evaluate the changing behaviour or dynamic nature of alluvial channel by enlightening average length and shape migration. Finally, state of the art techniques in Arc GIS has been adopted to prepare the mouza (village) wise erosion-deposition map by considering highly fluctuating mouzas of the Kaljani River and its adjacent village at the Himalayan foothill region. The primary data source was a series of time-sequential Landsat data of the years 1972, 1980, 1987, 1993, 1998, 2002, 2008, 2013, and 2019 spanning 47 years. Furthermore, we divided total study time into eight groups i.e. 1972-1980, 1980-1987, 1987-1993, 1993-1998, 1998-2002, 2002-2008, 2008-2013, and 2013-2019 for better understanding. During the study period (1972-2019) the average length of migration of the Kaljani River was 742.05 m and the annual rate was 15.79 m/year. Within this time frame of 1972-2019, the shape area migration of the channel was 66.79 km(2) and the annual rate was 1.42 km(2)/year. The total area of bank erosion from 1972 to 2019 equaled 62.74 km(2), out of which, 30.07 km(2) were on the right bank and 32.67 km(2) were at the left bank. Present analysis helps to enhance the effectiveness of planning and management of land resources and ecological balances in these 45 adjacent Mouzas of the Kaljani River. Among the various important causes, tectonic activity, rainfall, floods, and human intervention especially constriction of the embankment along the Kaljani River are the most significant causes for this dynamic changes of River Kaljani.

The groundwater samples collected from 81 tubewells and handpumps are analyzed for major ions, trace metals and stable isotopes (O-18 and D). Geochemically the dominant hydrochemical facies in the Una basin are Ca-HCO3, Ca-Mg-HCO3 and Na-Cl types at few locations. A relatively lower ionic concentration in the valley fills indicates dilution and low residence time of water to interact with the aquifer mass due to high porosity and permeability. The ionic ratios of 0.9, 0.8 and 3.8 to 5.7, respectively, for (Ca+Mg): HCO3, (Ca+Mg): (HCO3+SO4) and Na: Cl, suggests that ionic composition of groundwater is mainly controlled by rock weathering of, particularly by dissolution/precipitation of calcrete and calcite hosted in rock veins and Ca-Na feldspar hosted in conglomerate deposits derived from the Higher and Lesser Himalaya during the formation of Siwalik rocks. Although Na, K, NO3 and SO4 are introduced in the groundwater through agricultural practices, Na has also been introduced through ion exchange processes that have occurred during water-rock interaction, as indicated by negative CAI values. Factor analysis further suggests three major factors affecting the water chemistry of the area. The first two factors are associated with rock weathering while the third is anthropogenic processes associated with high nitrate and iron concentration. High concentrations of Fe and Mn ions that are exceeded that of WHO and BIS standards are also present at few locations. The recharge of groundwater in the Outer Himalaya is entirely through Indian Southwest Monsoon (ISM) and depleted ratios of O-18/D in valley region indicate infiltration from irrigation in recharging the groundwater and fractionation of isotopes of precipitation due to evaporation before infiltration. High d-excess values and inverse relation with O-18 are indicative of secondary evaporation of precipitation during recharge of groundwater.","[Thakur, Divya; Bartarya, S.

The principal objective of this study is to detect the river bank erosion potential zone using new Bank Erosion Susceptibility Index (BESI) model and spatiotemporal shifting of river Raidak-II (1980-2020). Sedimentary bank facies (SBF) analysis was conducted to identify the nature of cohesiveness of bank materials. The result showed that the maximum average lateral shifting (213.20 m) was recorded in the year 1990 (right bank), whereas the minimum average shifting (77.32 m) was measured in the year 2020 (right bank). The result also showed that the right bank of Raidak-II was mostly oscillated due to poorly sorted quaternary non-cohesive bank materials. The Bank Erosion Hazard Index (BEHI) model showed that 46.15% and 50% bank erosion sites are fallen in high-to-extreme bank erosion susceptibility zones in the years 2020 and 2022. In the case of BESI model, 69.23% and77.77% bank erosion sites are confined in high-to-extreme bank erosion susceptibility zones in the years 2020 and 2022. Therefore, BSEI model gives more precise results compared with BEHI due to three additional factors.

The objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of climate change on major hydrological components (precipitation-runoff, snow- and glacier-runoff, evapotranspiration and inter-annual change in streamflows) over the Hunza-, Gilgit- and Astore-River basins, located in HKH. For this purpose, three different hydrological models (snowmelt runoff (SRM), HEC-HMS and HBV are tested over snow- and glacier-covered river basins. These are subsequently integrated with the climate projections simulated from regional climate models (RCMs) developed under CORDEX-SA experiments. The basin-wide RCM-simulations for future scenarios exhibited an increase in precipitation but decline in intensity of rise over high-altitude zones. The temperature rise showed a maximum increase during monsoon by 4.18 degrees C, 4.37 degrees C and 4.34 degrees C over Hunza-, Gilgit- and Astore-River basins, respectively, for the period 2071-2099 (2090s) and a high emission scenario (RCP8.5). Further, in response to rise in precipitation and temperature, the SRM simulations showed a significant increase in snow- glacier-melt runoff (49%, 42% and 46% for SRM) and precipitation runoff (23.8%, 15.7% and 27% for HEC-HMS) in the Hunza-, Gilgit- and Astore-River basins, respectively, for the 2090s under RCP8.5. The streamflow projections for SRM showed a shift in hydrological regime with an increase by 369 (168.4%), 216.5 (74.8%) and 131.8 m(3)/s (82%) during pre-monsoon in the Hunza-, Gilgit- and Astore-River basins, respectively and then decline by -73.2 m(3)/s (-13.9%) and -45.4 m(3)/s (23.4%) during monsoon of the 2090s, in the Hunza- and Astore-River basins, respectively, under RCP8.5. Overall, the projections show that the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons are expected to be strongly influenced by climate change, through alterations in snow- and glacier-accumulation, and melt regimes with substantial consequences for river runoff in the region.

The MODIS daily snow cover product at 500m resolution from both the Aqua and Terra satellites was used to obtain daily snow cover maps. MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 images were compared to select cloud free or minimum cloud image to obtain the temporal distribution of snow cover area (SCA). Snow accumulation and depletion patterns were obtained by analysing SCA at different days. For most of the years, two peaks were observed in the SCA analysis. The conventional depletion curve (CDC) representing present climate was derived by determining and interpolating the SCA from cloud- free (cloud<5%) images for the selected hydrological year 2007. The investigation shows that the SCA was highest in February and lowest in May. Ten years meteorological data were used to normalize the temperature and precipitation data of the selected hydrological year (2007) to eliminate the impact of their yearly fluctuations on the snow cover depletion. The temperature and precipitation changes under four different projected climatic scenarios (A1B, A2, B1, and IPCC Commitment) were analysed for future years. Changes in the cumulative snowmelt depth with respect to the present climate for different future years were studied by a degree-day approach and were found to be highest under A1B, followed by A2, B1, and IPCC Commitment scenarios. It was observed that the A1B climatic scenario affected the depletion pattern most, making the depletion of snow to start and complete faster than under different scenarios. Advancing of depletion curve for different future years was found to be highest under A1B and lowest under IPCC Commitment scenarios with A2 and B1 in-between them.","[Mishra, P.; Bandyopadhyay, A.; Bhadra, A.] North Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Agr Engn, Nirjuli Itanagar 791109, Arunachal Prade, India",,"Bandyopadhyay, A (corresponding author), North Eastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Agr Engn, Nirjuli Itanagar 791109, Arunachal Prade, India.",arnabbandyo@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,19.0,2,,,,,199,210,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000411718300003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In our study area due to the complexity of the system, a prominent seasonal difference noticed among major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, and NO3-). There is a need for understanding the ions cycling as a whole and the directionality of the feedback loops in the system. Therefore, we provide an appraisal of our current hypothesis for seasonal difference in major ion concentration from snow samples for two corresponding years (2013 and 2015) at Dokriani Glacier. A systematic study of chemical compositions in the shallow snow pit from Dokriani Glacier was undertaken for the pre-monsoon season to understand the cycling of major ions from atmosphere to solute acquisition process. The intimating connections of ions cycling in snow and its temporal behavior was observed and analyzed through various statistical tests. Among major ions, the SO42- has the highest concentration among anions on an average considered as 14.21% in 2013 and 29.46% in 2015. On the other side Ca2+ is the dominant cation contributing 28.22% in 2013 and 15.3% in 2015 on average. The average ratio of Na+/Cl- was higher in 2013 whereas lower in 2015. The backward trajectory analysis suggests the possible sources of the ions transported from Central Asia through the Western Disturbance (WD) as a prominent source of winter precipitation mainly in the Central Himalaya. Ionic concentration of Ca2+ in cations was highly dominated while in anion SO42- played the major role. Factor analysis and correlation matrix suggested that, the precipitation chemistry is mostly influenced by anthropogenic, crustal, and sea salt sources over the studied region. The elemental cycling through ocean, atmosphere and biosphere opens up new ways to understand the geochemical processes operating at the glacierized catchments of the Himalaya.

C.",,,First observations of light non-methane hydrocarbons (C2-C5) over a high altitude site in the central Himalayas,ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"This study presents observations of methane (CH4) and light non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) for the first time from a high altitude site Nainital (29.4 degrees N, 79.5 degrees E, 1958 m amsl) in the central Himalayas. The whole air samples collected with a frequency of 3 samples per week during April 2009-December 2011 are analyzed using a Gas Chromatograph equipped with Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). Additionally, samples were collected from two semi-urban sites (Haldwani and Pantnagar) in the adjoining Indo Gangetic plain region. CH4 and NMHCs show a distinct seasonal cycle over this region with more frequent observations of higher levels during winter (DJF) and late autumn (SON) and lower levels during the summer-monsoon (JJA). Different NMHCs exhibit better correlations during autumn/winter as compared to the summer-monsoon season. The annual mean mixing ratios of methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, i-butane, n-butane, acetylene, and i-pentane at Nainital are measured to be 1.9 +/- 0.1 ppmv, 1.8 +/- 1.0, 0.7 +/- 0.9, 0.6 +/- 0.8, 0.6 +/- 0.7, 0.6 +/- 0.7, 0.5 +/- 0.6, 1.0 +/- 0.8, and 0.5 +/- 0.6, respectively (all in ppbv). The seasonal cycle of CH4 at Nainital is found to be similar to other global high altitude sites (jungfraujoch and Mauna Loa) but somewhat different than a high altitude site Mt. Abu in India. NMHCs, other than ethane and propane, are found to be higher over this central Himalayan region than other sites. Additionally, composition of NMHCs is shown to be different over the study region when compared with other sites in the IGP region. A correlation study between ln((n-butane)/(ethane)) and In((i-butane)/(ethane)) showed that oxidation by the OH radical is the main removal mechanism of these species over the central Himalaya and dilution maintains the ratios of these species. The lowest slope of propane and acetylene with CO during summer and spring are indicating absence of fresh air mass over this region. This study fills a major gap in observational data for light NMHCs in the Himalayas and has implications for better understanding of tropospheric chemistry over this region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the severity of this developing environmental hazard, the relative importance of each component of the water cycle still needs more detailed study so that those communities who will experience the greatest extremes in supply can be identified. Specifically, data showing how the contribution of meltwater varies with increasing distance downstream are lacking for many mountain catchments, although the use of stable isotope tracers provides some hope in this regard. Imprinted on regional-scale hydroclimatological controls of water availability are local-scale cultural beliefs and practices that have evolved over centuries, which determine who is able to access water supplies, for how long, and for what purpose. Building the resilience of human populations and the environment to future changes in water supply therefore depends on effective interdisciplinary team working to develop an understanding of the complex interactions between physical, socioeconomic, cultural, and historical factors, and that can only be properly realized if local communities are considered as an integral part of the research team. Developing simple and practical methods for water management, storage, and societal adaptation that are appropriate to the socioeconomic and political conditions of mountain-dwelling communities will only be sustainable if they are built on this integrated knowledge base.

The objective of this study was to extend the concept of remote sensing based assessment of beta-diversity to multi-scale domain by multi-resolution optical satellite data. This study was conducted in a reserved forest of western Himalaya, India; a region affected by the invasive Lantana camara L (lantana). We calculated and compared Rao's Q and Shannon indices at different spatial resolutions (0.5, 5, and 30 m) and scales (window sizes) by using imageries from Pleiades 1A, RapidEye, and Landsat-8 acquired in April 2013, the pre-monsoon season. Rao's Q index explained diversity more accurately than Shannon index for the three analyzed stand densities. Diversity was better approximated by Rao's Q index calculated by Pleiades 1A at a resolution of 0.5 m at low stand density. We observed higher correlations of the average coefficient of variation (CV) with Rao's Q and Shannon indices for areas associated with mixed spectral reflectance caused by overstory and understory vegetation. Furthermore, CV was lower in open areas dominated by lantana. These results indicated a strong scale and spatial resolution dependence of Rao's Q index on remote sensing-derived spectral heterogeneity information. When applied in heterogeneous forest environments, Rao's Q index could represent a better remote sensing proxy to estimate beta-diversity than the conventional Shannon index.","[Khare, Siddhartha; Rossi, Sergio] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Sci Fondamentales, Saguenay, PQ, Canada; [Latifi, Hooman] KN Toosi Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Geomat Engn, Dept Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Tehran, Iran; [Latifi, Hooman] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Remote Sensing, Wurzburg, Germany; [Rossi, Sergio] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Vegetat Restorat & Management Degraded Ec, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Appl Bot, South China Bot Garden, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Latifi, H (corresponding author), KN Toosi Univ Technol, Fac Geodesy & Geomat Engn, Dept Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Tehran, Iran.",hooman.latifi@kntu.ac.ir,,,,,,,,30.0,33.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019,106.0,,,,,,,,105520,10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105520,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.105520,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000490577900083,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper aims to present the capacity building approach and applications designed to fill these gaps and empower decision makers and practitioners in using EO data and GIT through information education and training. The capacity building approach consists of four components: assessment, design, implementation, and monitoring (ADIM). The assessment component focuses on identifying the needs and priorities of capacity building for targeted groups or institutions. The design component develops training content in order to execute the plan in coordination with subject matter experts (SME). The implementation component executes the capacity building activity in any of these four formats-standard training, training of trainers, on-the-job training, and exposure learning. The monitoring component helps to identify the participants' expectations, learning achievements, and feedback so as to improve future capacity building events. In the application of ADIM, we conducted needs assessment in four countries, designed 26 types of capacity building contents and implemented 39 capacity building events. A range of thematic topics-from agriculture and food security, water resources and hydro-climatic disasters, land use, land cover and ecosystem, weather and climate services, to crosscutting issues-were covered in the events. Altogether, the activities reached out to over 1,000 individuals (35% of them women) from over 200 unique institutions in 30 countries. Institutional capacity was built for universities in Afghanistan and Bangladesh to design and deliver courses independently. The capacity of partner agencies were built to co-design and co-develop data and applications. The approach also experienced challenges in the nomination process and in identifying women participants due to the lack of women professionals in the field and in the respective agencies. The ADIM approach and its workflow focused on bridging the gap between the current trend and progression in EO and GIT fields and the existing state of capacity of the agencies involved in the decision-making process. It promoted gender equity, adopted frontier technologies, engaged SMEs and provided sustainable solutions, which are starting to bring success stories in the region.","[Thapa, Rajesh Bahadur; Matin, Mir A.; Bajracharya, Birendra] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Thapa, RB (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal.",rajesh.thapa@icimod.org,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 22,2019,7.0,,,,,,,,165,10.3389/fenvs.2019.00165,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00165,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000494444500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The results show that the meltwater runoff contributes 67.4%, of the proglacial discharge, out of which snowmelt, clean ice melting, buried-ice ablation and ice-cliff backwasting account for 22.4%, 21.9%, 17.9% and 5.3% of the total melt runoff, respectively. Rainfall runoff is significant in mid-latitude glacierized mountain areas like Tianshan and Karakorum. In the Koxkar glacier catchment, about 11.5% of stream water is initiated from liquid precipitation. Spatial distributions for each glacial runoff component reveal the importance of climatic gradients, local topography and morphology on glacial runoff generation, and temporal variations of these components is closely related to the annual cycle of catchment meteorology and glacier storage.

The characteristic timing and intensity of the ISM and Westerlies, leaves a distinct footprint on the sediment load of the River. Analysis with the last forty years data, shows an increasing trend for temperature. While for precipitation during the same period, the Spiti watershed on the west has highest monthly accumulated precipitation with long term declining trend, in contrast to the other areas where an increasing trend has been observed. Thus, to probe the hydrological variability and the seasonal attributes, governed by the Westerlies and ISM in the study area, we analyzed precipitation, temperature, snow cover area (in %), discharge, suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and suspended sediment load (SSL) for the period 2004 - 2008. To accomplish the task, we used the available data of five hydrological stations located in the study area. Inter-annual shift in peak discharge during the monsoon period is controlled by the variation in precipitation, snow melt, glacier melt and temperature. Besides seasonal variability has been observed in generation of the sediments and its delivery to the river. Our analysis indicates, dominance of the Westerlies footprints in the hydrological parameters of the Spiti region, towards western part of the study area. While, it is observed that the hydrology of the Khab towards eastern part of the study area shows dominance of ISM. Further downstream, the hydrology of Nathpa station also shows dominance of ISM. It also emerged out that the snowmelt contribution to the River flow is mostly during the initial part, at the onset of the monsoon, while for rest and major part of the summer monsoon season, the River flow is augmented by the precipitation, glacial melt and some snow melt. We observed, that the SSC increases exponentially in response to increase in temperature and correlates positively with River discharge. The average daily SSL in the summer monsoon is many times more than that in the winter monsoon. The downstream decrease in steepness of the sediment rating curve is attributed to either a change in the River-sediment dynamics or on account of the anthropogenic forcing. The top 1% of the extreme summer monsoon events (only 4 events) in our study area contribute up to 45% of SSL to the total sediment load budget. It has also been observed that the River-sediment dynamics in the upstream catchments are more vulnerable and sensitive to the extreme events in comparison to the downstream catchments. The present study for the first time gives a holistic insight in to the complex dynamics of the hydrological processes operational in the study area. The research findings would be crucial for managing the water resources of the region and the linked water and food security.","[Kumar, Prem; Shekhar, Shashank] Univ Delhi, Dept Geol, Delhi 110007, India; [Dubey, Chandra Shekhar] Sri Sri Univ, Godisahi, Odisha, India; [Kumar, Om] Univ Delhi, Lakshmibai Coll, New Delhi, India; [Shukla, D.

The Index of Geo-accumulation indicated that pollution of trace metals were higher in lower Indus plains than on mountain areas. In general, the toxic elements Cr, Mn, Co and Ni exhibited altitudinal trends (P < 0.05). The few exceptions to this trend were the higher values for all studied elements from the northern wet mountainous zone (low lying Himalaya). Spatial PCA/FA highlighted that the sources of different trace elements were zone specific, thus pointing to both geological influences and anthropogenic activities.

In this study, a variant of the previous water quality index was used to evaluate the pollution status in the Wular Lake, Kashmir, which is a Ramsar site and wetland of international importance. The index termed as water quality status index (WQSI) is considered as a simple pollution indicator to support management actions in the Wular Lake, Kashmir. WQSI is a valuable and unique rating to depict the overall water quality status and pollution level of the waterbody in a spatial context and is also capable of dealing with those water quality parameters which do not have well-developed standard values. In this study, the water quality of the Wular Lake was investigated in June 2013 for 21 sample locations. The index used in this work is composed of 13 measurable physico-chemical parameters - pH, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, alkalinity, hardness, chloride, total dissolved solids, ammonia, iron, nitrite, nitrate and fluoride. The generation of WQSI is based on weighted overlay technique, in which interpolated raster maps were generated for all the 13 water quality parameters and weights are assigned to each and every parameter using analytic hierarchy process technique, considering their status as benefit or cost criteria. Based on the value of WQSI, the whole lake was divided into five zones, comprising least polluted zone (23%), moderately polluted zone (20%), high polluted zone (30%), very high polluted zone (22%) and extremely polluted zone (5%). From this study, it has been found that 60km(2) (77%) of total lake area constitutes the moderate to extremely polluted zone and only 18km(2) (23%) of the total lake area constitutes the least polluted zone, which is in the north-west region of the lake. The study reveals that the world-famous Wular Lake is undergoing the eutrophication process and as a result of which the lake is losing its water holding capacity to deal with the disastrous flood problem in Kashmir region.","[Mushtaq, Fayma; Lala, Mili Ghosh Nee] Birla Inst Technol Mesra, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi 835215, Bihar, India; [Pandey, A.

The research reviews six most widely used urban sustainability assessment tools i.e., Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM)for Communities, Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE) for Urban Development, Green Building Index (GBI)for Township, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for Neighbourhood Development that are used in other countries, and Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) for Green Townships and Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) for large Development which are used in India. Analysis of these assessment tools reveals that most of them view sustainability from different perspectives by laying more emphasis on some aspects like infrastructure and resource management while ignoring others like cultural, business and innovation. The findings of the analysis highlight that certain aspects are given more importance in all the urban sustainability assessment tools reviewed and certain other aspects are given much lower or no consideration in all tools reflecting an incomprehensive understanding of urban sustainability on one hand; most tools reviewed do not address all context-specific aspects on the other. Further, it is observed that these tools are unable to address the complex relationships among various criteria and categories and each criterion is assessed in isolation irrespective of the fact that it can influence or be influenced by other criteria.

Our study capitalizes on the interregional ES flow among the three countries - China, India, and Myanmar - that share the far-eastern Himalayan Landscape. We used participatory GIS mapping to visualize the ES flow from three protected areas (PAs) in the landscape, and participatory scenario analysis to understand the direction PA management could take. The service provisioning hotspots, the service beneficiary areas (SBAs), and the degraded service provisioning hotspots (dSPHs) were mapped for ES that was of high management priority. The trade-offs among the ES were analysed for the three scenarios - Nature-at-Work, Nature-People Harmony, and People-at-Work. The argument for regional cooperation was affirmed with several dSPHs lying along the border, and SBAs reaching beneficiaries beyond the PAs and one country. The performances of ES under different scenarios indicated that future management of PAs must widen conservation constituencies and capitalize on multiple benefits from PAs, essentially to maximize livelihoods benefits to communities who live in and around PAs. We recommend intra, inter-country, and regional cooperation pathways for the future sustenance of ES from PAs in the landscape.","[Shakya, Bandana; Uddin, Kabir; Shaoliang, Yi] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Khumaltar 44700, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Bhatta, Laxmi Dutt] Agr & Forestry Univ, Fac Forestry, Hetauda 44100, Nepal; [Lodhi, Mahendra Singh] Minist Environm Forests & Climate Change, GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, North East Unit, Itanagar 791113, India; [Htun, Naing Zaw] Minist Nat Resources & Environm Conservat, Forest Dept, Nat Wildlife Conservat Div, Nay Pyi Taw 15011, Myanmar; [Yongping, Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Kunming Inst Bot, Kunming 650201, Yunnan, Peoples R China",,"Shakya, B (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Khumaltar 44700, Lalitpur, Nepal.",bandana.shakya@icimod.org,,,,,,,,17.0,18.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,47.0,,,,,,,,101222,10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.101222,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.101222,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000616301800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

While contemporary literature often emphasizes the novelty of forest restoration programmes as exemplified in large-scale global pledges such as the Bonn Challenge or the Trillion Trees initiative, we show that forest restoration has thousands of years of history in India. Furthermore, this history plays an important role in shaping current restoration efforts, in ways that often undermine restoration goals. We find four themes in this history: the definitions of forests changed as the national administration metamorphosed, the philosophy behind the afforestation practices transitioned from commercial to a focus on forest cover that still underemphasizes ecological and subsistence values of forests, the involvement of forest-dependent people in forest restoration has been limited by government policies through much of this period, and current restoration practice draws more from the history of commercial timber production than from contemporary restoration science. Drawing on these insights, we argue that restoration programmes need to be reconsidered in India.","[Roy, Anirban] Ashoka Trust Res Ecol & Environm, Royal Enclave, PO Jakkur, Bengaluru 560064, Karnataka, India; [Roy, Anirban] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal, Karnataka, India; [Roy, Anirban; Fleischman, Forrest] Univ Minnesota, Dept Forest Resources, St Paul, MN USA",,"Roy, A (corresponding author), Ashoka Trust Res Ecol & Environm, Royal Enclave, PO Jakkur, Bengaluru 560064, Karnataka, India.",anirban.roy@atree.org,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,33.0,10,,,,,1527,1540,,10.1002/ldr.4258,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4258,,APR 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000786712200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Promotion of the natural resource-based value chain for allo (the Himalayan nettle, Girardinia diversifolia) was identified as an innovative livelihood strategy by the local community. Value chain development started in 2014. The project was designed to focus on women and include participation by the private sector. This paper analyzes the impact of the project, especially on women's lives, using primary and secondary data. A community-owned enterprise was established with private-sector support from the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation's Business Association of Home Based Workers (SABAH) Nepal. The enterprise now has 82 members (69 of them women), with 150 households benefiting directly and indirectly. SABAH Nepal provided training in sustainable harvesting and processing techniques and promotes the products in high-end international markets. A buyback guarantee scheme provides security to local artisans. The quality and range of allo products have increased markedly, as has the share in benefits for local people. Skills training and visits to trade fairs have helped women build their capacity and take a leading role in the value chain process. The communityowned enterprise members have earned up to NPR 4000 per month from sewing, more than the local rate for day labor and sufficient to cover general household expenses. More than 25 women entrepreneurs have started microbusinesses related to allo. Allo has become an important economic asset, transforming the lives of mountain women in this village area.

Tarai of Nepal is a tropical region located in the foothills of the Central Himalaya as a country's food granary with a contribution of over 50% to the entire country's agricultural production. However, there is a lack of detailed studies exploring the spatiotemporal occurrence of drought in these regions under the changing climate. In this study, we used the ensemble of nine climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) under two shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs), namely SSP245 (an intermediate development pathway) and SSP585 (a high development pathway), to assess anticipated drought during the mid-century. We used bias-corrected gridded data from the Worldclim to project drought events by the end of the mid-century based on the historical period (1989-2018). We computed historical and projected Thornthwaite moisture index (TMI) to evaluate soil moisture conditions on a seasonal scale for the Tarai region's Eastern, Central, and Western parts. The model ensemble projected a significant increase in precipitation and temperature for the entire Tarai by the end of mid-century. However, the winter and spring seasons are projected to suffer precipitation deficiency and a temperature rise. Our results indicated that the Eastern Tarai would likely experience a decrease in winter precipitation. We emphasize that the presented spatiotemporal pattern of the MI will be instrumental in addressing the irrigation facility's needs, choice, and rotation of crops under the changing climate scenarios and in improving our mitigation measures and adaptation plans for sustainability of the agriculture in drought-prone areas.","[Shah, Suraj; Song, Xianfeng; Habiyakare, Telesphore] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Tiwari, Achyut] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kirtipur Kathmandu, Nepal; [Talchabahdel, Rocky] Texas A&M Univ, Texas A&M AgriLife Res, El Paso, TX USA; [Adhikari, Arjun] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Nat Resource Ecol & Management, 008C Agr Hall, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",,"Song, XF (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",shahsanap89@mails.ucas.ac.cn; achyutone@gmail.com; xfsong@ucas.ac.cn; rocky.talchabhadel@ag.tamu.edu; t.habiyakare@yahoo.com; aadhikari@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,194.0,9,,,,,,,642,10.1007/s10661-022-10275-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10275-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000836637900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Mrigthuni Glacier, one of the major glaciers in the Pindar River basin in Uttarakhand, has been selected as a study glacier for the present analysis. The long-term (1951-2018) meteorological data analysis indicated that the temperature increased in both the maximum ablation and accumulation period; however, the precipitation decreased during the primary accumulation period. The change detected in climate patterns provided an impetus to study its impact on the glacier using geospatial techniques. It was found that the glacier front retreated by 831.4 +/- 42 m at the rate of 32.94 m yr(-1) from 1990 to 2015. Further, the glacier accumulation area ratio has reduced from 55.63 to 53.22%, with a 66 m upward shift in equilibrium line altitude (ELA). The glacier's mass balance has reduced from 0.23 to 0.28 +/- 0.035 m w.e. during the analysis period, based on a general equation developed for northwestern Himalaya using the optical remote sensing data. Due to the limitations of optical data, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data was used to map glacier radar zones. The distinct percolation/refreeze, transient firn, and ablation zones were identified on the SAR data composite of the different seasons. Considering SAR-based ELA as the most accurate, the analysis confirmed the negative mass balance with a value of 0.62 +/- 0.036 m w.e. Therefore, it was concluded that SAR-based analysis might be vital for accurate glacier dynamics studies especially the mass balance.","[Garg, Vaibhav; Thakur, Praveen Kumar; Nikam, Bhaskar R.; Aggarwal, Shiv Prasad] Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Water Resources Dept, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India; [Kudekar, Aditya Rajendra] Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Dept Geog, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Kudekar, Aditya Rajendra] Univ Munster, Munster, Germany; [Chauhan, Prakash] Indian Inst Remote Sensing, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India",,"Garg, V (corresponding author), Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Water Resources Dept, 4 Kalidas Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India.",vaibhav@iirs.gov.in; adityakudekar.ak@gmail.com; praveen@iirs.gov.in; bhaskarnikam@iirs.gov.in; spa@iirs.gov.in; prakash@iirs.gov.in,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2021,49.0,10,,,,,2387,2406,,10.1007/s12524-021-01388-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-021-01388-5,,JUL 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000669776900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To conserve aquatic ecosystems, the minimal desired river flow regime-environmental flows-is advised to maintain in the river system. While maintaining environmental flows, it is equally important to carry out the impact of environmental flows over the hydro-energy generation capacity of hydropower projects. In the present study, the energy generation reduction of provisioning environmental flows has been assessed for five major hydro electric projects on Rivers Bhagirathi and Alaknanda, the two significant head-streams of India's national river Ganga, located in the Himalayan uplands. The E-Flows assessment done by Tare et al., (2017) is used in the present study, which rationally integrates the ecological and geo-morphological needs of the river. Tare et al., (2017) recommended monthly E-Flows for the upper Ganga basin from similar to 23 to similar to 40% and similar to 29 to similar to 53% of natural flows for the wet and lean periods, respectively. They assessed E-Flows using flow data of the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers for 1972-1982 and 1977-1987, respectively. The annual average reduction in potential energy production due to E-Flows provision in the Alaknanda-Bhagirathi basin is found in between 14.9 and 21.0% for these hydro electric projects. The estimated reduction in energy generation is higher in the lean flow period than in the wet period. This study shows that about 79 to 85% of capacity power generation is possible in the basin after provisioning E-Flows.","[Modi, Ankit; Tare, Vinod; Sharma, Devkinandan] Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Sharma, D (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.",devakinandan1804@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2022,233.0,8,,,,,,,304,10.1007/s11270-022-05788-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05788-2,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000829163700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research investigates the changes in precipitation and surface air temperature indices in the seven irrigation zones of Punjab Province during the last 50 years; this province is a very important region in Pakistan in terms of agriculture and irrigated farming. The reliability of the data was examined using double mass curve and autocorrelation analysis. The magnitude and significance of the precipitation and temperature were visualized by various statistical methods. The stations' trends were spatially distributed to better understand climatic variability across the elevation gradient of the study region. The results showed a significant warming trend in annual T-min (minimum temperature) and T-mean (mean temperature) in different irrigation zones. However, T-max (maximum temperature) had insignificant variations except in the high elevation Thal zone. Moreover, the rate of T-min increased faster than that of T-max, resulting in a reduction in the diurnal temperature range (DTR). On a seasonal scale, warming was more pronounced during spring, followed by that in winter and autumn. However, the summer season exhibited insignificant negative trends in most of the zones and gauges, except in the higher-altitude Thal zone. Overall, Bahawalpur and Faisalabad are the zones most vulnerable to warming annually and in the spring, respectively. Furthermore, the elevation-dependent trend (EDT) indicated larger increments in T-max for higher-elevation (above 500 m a.s.l.) stations, compared to the lower-elevation ones, on both annual and seasonal scales. In contrast, the T-min showed opposite trends at higher- and lower-elevation stations, while a moderate increase was witnessed in T-mean trends from lower to higher altitude over the study region. An increasing trend in DTR was observed at higher elevation, while a decreasing trend was noticed at the lower-elevation stations. The analysis of precipitation data indicated wide variability over the entire region during the study period. Most previous studies reported no change or a decreasing trend in precipitation in this region. Conversely, our findings indicated the cumulative increase in annual and autumn precipitation amounts at zonal and regional level. However, EDT analysis identified the decrease in precipitation amounts at higher elevation (above 1000 m a.s.l.) and increase at the lower-elevation stations. Overall, our findings revealed unprecedented evidence of regional climate change from the perspectives of seasonal warming and variations in precipitation and temperature extremes (T-max and T-min) particularly at higher-elevation sites, resulting in a variability of the DTR, which could have a significant influence on water resources and on the phenology of vegetation and crops at zonal and station level in Punjab.","[Nawaz, Zain; Wang, Xufeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Remote Sensing Gansu Prov, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Nawaz, Zain; Wang, Xufeng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin; Chen, Yingying; Guo, Yanlong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Xin; Chen, Yingying] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Nawaz, Naima] Univ Agr Faisalabad, Dept Rural Sociol, Faisalabad 38040, Pakistan",,"Chen, YY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Chen, YY (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zain-nawaz@lzb.ac.cn; lixin@lzb.ac.cn; chenyy@itpcas.ac.cn; guoyl1987@126.com; wangxufeng@lzb.ac.cn; naimauaf@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,41.0,41.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2019,11.0,9,,,,,,,1916,10.3390/w11091916,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11091916,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000488834400179,View Full Record in Web of Science

In northeastern India too, dolphins were seen in all the major rivers and also in certain wetlands during monsoon months till the early 1980s. However, the sighting of dolphins is rare now due to natural and human-induced factors. Three factors - adequate water cover, water quality, and abundance of prey food either individually or in combination- relate to River Dolphins' existence. Variability of meteorological parameters also severely impacts on the limno-biological parameters of riverine habitats. Restoration of Gangetic Dolphins in their traditional habitats can boost ecotourism in the region.

But today there is no significant difference between metropolitan towns on the plains to tiny tourist/religious spots in the hills of the Himalayas owing to a high influx of more than 1.16 lakh visitors within a 4-month season in a year. The beautiful treks from Govind Ghat (1928 m) to Hemkund Sahib (4329 m) and the Valley of Flowers National Park have suffered from litter and foul smells due to unattended solid waste. In the first part of the study, the perceptions of participatory groups such as visitors, stall keepers, the host community, the Gurudwara management committee (GMC) and district administration (DA) regarding environmental assessment of solid waste management (SWM) have been taken into account. Since visitors and stall keepers are the major contributory participatory groups in generating and causing primarily solid waste problems, they were studied in detail. The local villagers as a host community by means of participatory interactions and meetings were assessed as an important participatory group along with assessments of their other problems. In addition, the GMC and DA have been assessed as regulatory participatory bodies at local and government levels for ongoing tourism activities and the resultant solid waste problem. Three hundred and fifty one visitors and 40% of the stall keepers were thoroughly interviewed. The second part of the study highlights the estimation of solid waste generation from the essential commodities supplying visitors at halting areas (e.g. Ghangariya) and Hemkund Sikh shrine. Solid waste generation from stalls was measured at > 50% of the total waste. Chemical analyses were also conducted for suitable waste. Based on average results, some of the practical but small recovery packages of SWM options such as reuse and recycling were suggested to eliminate the problem completely from the religious-tourist sites in the Himalayas or from other similar mountain regions of the world.

It was also committed that the parties would continue with all-out endeavor to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C. For a country like India with a primarily agrarian economy this leads to two key questions. Firstly, what does the global rise of mean annual temperature (1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C) mean at the regional scale? Secondly, what are the implications of keeping warming at or below 1.5 degrees C for different sectors and in particular on agriculture and water resources? To address these questions we have examined the annual and seasonal impacts of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global temperature rise (GTR) on temperature and rainfall change over all the states of India under two Representative concentration pathways, RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, using all Coupled Model Inter Comparison Project CMIP5 Models. Rainfall is projected to increase over all the states with very low change in the western part of the country and highest change in the North eastern and southern region of the country under RCP 8.5. 35% of the country is projected to witness a temperature change equal to or lesser than global mean temperature of 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C whereas 65% is expected to show a greater rise in temperature. The most severe temperature change is expected to be witnessed by the presently colder Northern most states of India such as Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal (2.0 degrees C to 2.2 degrees C at 1.5 degrees C and 2.5 degrees C to 2.8 degrees C at 2.0 degrees C) in both RCPs. There are opportunities and threats due to climate change and it is imperative for researchers and policy makers to recognize these in the context of the scenarios of 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C global temperature changes. It is essential for the current national and state action plan on climate change and adaptation to be more sensitive in strategizing an efficient response to the different scenarios at the global level (3 degrees C, 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C) in order to take more informed policy decisions at global level in synergy with the regional analysis to be able to develop strategies that benefit the local populace.","[Yaduvanshi, Aradhana; Bendapudi, Ramkumar] WOTR Ctr Resilience Studies, W CReS, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Zaroug, Modathir] Nile Basin Initiat, Entebbe, Uganda; [Zaroug, Modathir; New, Mark] Univ Cape Town, African Climate & Dev Initiat, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Zaroug, Modathir; New, Mark] Univ Cape Town, Climate Syst Anal Grp, Rondebosch, South Africa",,"Yaduvanshi, A (corresponding author), WOTR Ctr Resilience Studies, W CReS, Pune, Maharashtra, India.",aradhanayaduvanshi10@gmail.com; mzaroug@nilebasin.org; rbendapudi@yahoo.com; mark.new@uct.ac.za,,,,,,,,20.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2019,1.0,12,,,,,,,125002,10.1088/2515-7620/ab4ee2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ab4ee2,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000579511300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Four aspects (east, west, north and south) in each altitudinal belt were chosen for sampling to depict maximum representation of vegetation in the sanctuary. Population structure and regeneration behaviour was analysed seasonally for two years to show the establishment and growth of tree species. A total of 147 plant species were recorded from the entire region of which 27 tree species were selected for detailed study. Highest number was recorded at upper (18 species), and lowest at lower altitudinal belt (15 species). The relative proportion of species richness showed higher contribution of tree layer at each altitudinal belt. The population structure, based on the number of individuals, revealed a greater proportion of seedling layer at each altitudinal belt. The relative proportion of seedlings increases significantly along altitudinal belts (p < 0.05) while opposite trends were observed in sapling and tree layers. The density of sapling and seedling species varied non-significantly across seasons (p > 0.05). The density values decreased in summer and increased during rainy season. As far as the regeneration status is concerned, middle and upper altitudinal belts showed maximum number of species with fair regeneration as compared to lower altitudinal belt. Overall density diameter distribution of tree species showed highest species density and richness in the smallest girth class and decreased in the succeeding girth classes. This study suggests that patterns of regeneration behaviour would determine future structural and compositional changes in the forest communities. It is suggested that the compositional changes vis-A -vis role of 'New' and 'Not regenerating' species need priority attention while initiating conservation activities in the sanctuary. This study calls for exploring other less explored Wildlife Sanctuaries in the Himalaya and across the world, to achieve overall biodiversity status in these protected areas and thus to justify their role in conserving biodiversity in the region.","[Rawat, Balwant; Negi, Vikram S.] GB Pant Inst Himalayan Environm & Dev, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India; [Mishra Rawat, Janhvi] Forest Res Inst, Bot Div, Dehra Dun 248005, Uttarakhand, India; [Tewari, Lalit M.] Kumaun Univ, Dept Bot, Naini Tal 263001, Uttarakhand, India; [Rawat, Laxmi] Forest Res Inst, Forest Ecol & Environm Div, Dehra Dun 248005, Uttarakhand, India",,"Rawat, B (corresponding author), GB Pant Inst Himalayan Environm & Dev, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India.",balwantkam@gmail.com,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2013,10.0,5,,,,,854,865,,10.1007/s11629-013-2514-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-013-2514-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000325070700015,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, formation of secondary organic aerosols is being increasingly recognized as an important process in contributing to the air-pollution and poor visibility over urban regions. It is, thus, essential to study atmospheric concentrations of carbonaceous species (EC, OC and WSOC), their mixing state and absorption properties on a regional scale. This paper presents the comprehensive data on emission sources, chemical characteristics and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols from selected urban sites in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and from a high-altitude location in the central Himalaya. The mass concentrations of OC, EC and WSOC exhibit large spatio-temporal variability in the IGP. This is attributed to seasonally varying emissions from post-harvest agricultural-waste burning, their source strength, boundary layer dynamics and secondary aerosol formation. The high concentrations of OC and SO, and their characteristic high mass scattering efficiency, contribute significantly to the aerosol optical depth and scattering coefficient. This has implications to the assessment of single scattering albedo and aerosol radiative forcing on a regional scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Ram, Kirpa; Sarin, M.

Higher altitudes tend to receive higher doses of ambient UV-B radiation. The present study was carried out to assess the effects of enhanced UV-B (ambient + 10.2 kJ m(-2) day(-1)) radiation on two cultivars of Phaseolus vulgaris L. (cv. Pusa Himlata and Pusa Parvati) at growth, physiological, and biochemical levels grown under mountain ecosystem. The magnitudes of negative effects of enhanced UV-B radiation were found more in Pusa Parvati as compared to Pusa Himlata. Non-enzymatic (total phenolics and flavonoids content) and enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase) were increased in both cultivars at both the ages of growth but increase was found more in Pusa Himlata as compared to Pusa Parvati. The study further showed that the economic yield of Pusa Himlata and Pusa Parvati was decreased by 14 and 44 %, respectively, due to enhanced UV-B radiation. The higher decrease in the economic yield of Pusa Parvati depicted that increased amounts of total flavonoids content and stimulation of their antioxidant defense mechanism via increasing the activities of enzymatic antioxidants were not able to completely detoxify the produced reactive oxygen species under enhanced UV-B radiation and made it more sensitive to applied stress. From the present study, it can be concluded that enhanced UV-B radiation in the mountain areas of the Indian Himalayan Regions could be one of the environmental causes for lower yields of agricultural crops. Cultivation of P. vulgaris L. cv.

The intricate surface morphology of debris-covered glaciers renders difficulties in their assessment through satellite remote sensing alone. In this context, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the advantage of providing ultra-high-resolution maps of the debris-covered glacier surfaces, thus, aid in inferring the complexity in their behavior. Considering the limitations and to help elucidate the morpho-dynamic evolution of the debris-covered glacier surface, an in-depth investigation is conducted on the Panchi Nala-A glacier (area: 3 km(2); debris percentage: 60%; and thickness: 4-60 cm), Bhaga basin, western Himalaya, using hybrid remote sensing data (declassified Corona, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI, Planetscope, and UAV-based optical images) during 1971-2021.

The glacier velocity has reduced, however, trivially (0.6 & PLUSMN; 6 ma(-1)) during 1993-2021, with stagnation in the lower ablation zone (velocity < 5ma(-1)).

The comprehensive picture suggests that the glacier changes are possibly influenced by debris distribution, however, are not substantial and have remained consistent, indicative of its near-stable condition. This glacier response may further change depending on ice cliffs and supraglacial pond dynamics, which have shown a rise of 3.8 times and 86%, respectively, during the recent period between 2019 and 2021.","[Garg, Siddhi; Navinkumar, P.

The Upper Mustang region, a cold desert, represents a hot-spot for climate change: indeed, violent hailstorms and rainstorms have been recently observed, consequently exposing land to erosion. Results of this study indicate that waters in the region belong to the Ca-HCO3, Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4 and Na-K-Cl-types, reflecting different hydrochemical regimes. Uranium is widespread in waters, with concentrations up to 19 mu g/L recorded in a potable water supply. Locally, anoxic conditions affect uranium mobility due to the low solubility of U(IV) minerals. Highly toxic thallium was detected in a thermal spring at an elevated concentration (45 mu g/L Tl). The association of thallium with high concentrations of iron suggests that these elements are derived from pyrite oxidation. Detectable levels of thallium were also measured in the water of an irrigation ditch. Lithium concentrations ranged from 7 mu g/L to 12 mg/L in the thermal water and showed a strong association with chloride ions. Arsenic concentrations up to 4.7 mu g/L were measured in tributaries of the Kali Gandaki river. The data provide evidence that solutes in water have originated from an array of input sources, including carbonate dissolution, the dissolution of soluble salts, silicate weathering and localized sulfide oxidation. In particular, chemical weathering of granitic rocks is likely the primary source for metals and metalloids in waters. Since the erosion rate is a factor affecting lithological weathering, highintensity rainfalls due to climate change are expected to influence the release and fate of potentially harmful elements in the in the Upper Mustang Valley.","[Ghezzi, L.; Petrini, R.; Montomoli, C.] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via S Maria 53, I-56126 Pisa, Italy; [Carosi, R.] Univ Turin, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Valperga Caluso 35, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Paudyal, K.] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Geol, Kirtipur Kathmandu, Nepal; [Cidu, R.] Univ Cagliari, Dipartimento Sci Chim & Geol, I-09042 Monserrato, CA, Italy",,"Petrini, R (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via S Maria 53, I-56126 Pisa, Italy.",riccardo.petrini@unipi.it,,,,,,,,10.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2017,76.0,19,,,,,,,651,10.1007/s12665-017-6991-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6991-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000412736700007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Few research studied climate change scenarios in the transboundary Chitral Kabul River Basin (CKRB) despite its vulnerability to global warming and importance as a region inhabited with more than 10 million people where no treaty on use of water exists between Afghanistan and Pakistan. This study examines the meteorological and agricultural drought between 2000 and 2018 and their future trends from 2020 to 2030 in the CKRB. To study meteorological and agricultural drought comprehensively, various single drought indices such as Precipitation Condition Index (PCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI) and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and combined drought indices such as Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) and Microwave Integrated Drought Index (MIDI) were utilized. As non-microwave data were used in MIDI, this index was given a new name as Non-Microwave Integrated Drought Index (NMIDI). Our research has found that 2000 was the driest year in the monsoon season followed by 2004 that experienced both meteorological and agricultural drought between 2000 and 2018. Results also indicate that though there exists spatial variation in the agricultural and meteorological drought, but temporally there has been a decreasing trend observed from 2000 to 2018 for both types of droughts. This trend is projected to continue in the future drought projections between 2020 and 2030. The overall study results indicate that drought can be properly assessed by integration of different data sources and therefore management plans can be developed to address the risk and signing new treaties.","[Baig, Muhammad Hasan Ali; Khan, Muhammad Roman; Amin, Muhammad] PMAS Arid Agr Univ Rawalpindi, Inst Geoinformat & Earth Observat, Rawalpindi 46300, Pakistan; [Abid, Muhammad] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Interdisciplinary Res Ctr, Wah Campus, Rawalpindi 47040, Pakistan; [Jiao, Wenzhe] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Adnan, Shahzada] Pakistan Meteorol Dept, Natl Drought Monitoring Ctr, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",,"Baig, MHA (corresponding author), PMAS Arid Agr Univ Rawalpindi, Inst Geoinformat & Earth Observat, Rawalpindi 46300, Pakistan.",mhasanbaig@uaar.edu.pk; drabid@ciitwah.edu.pk; romankhan01.rk@gmail.com; wenzjiao@iu.edu; m.amin@uaar.edu.pk; shaz_adnan@pmd.gov.pk,,,,,,,,18.0,18.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2020,12.0,9,,,,,,,1417,10.3390/rs12091417,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12091417,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000543394000064,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yak represents a major mammal species of the rangelands found across the Asian highlands from Russia and Kyrgyzstan in the west to the Hengduan Mountains of China in the east. Yak also has great cultural significance to the people of the Asian highlands and is closely interlinked to the traditions, cultures, and rituals of the herding communities. However, increasing issues like poverty, environmental degradation, and climate change have changed the traditional practices of pastoralism, isolating and fragmenting herders and the pastures they have been using for many years. Local cultures of people rooted in the practice of yak herding are disappearing. Therefore, it is very important to document the socioeconomic and cultural aspects of yak herding. The broad aim of this paper was to provide a brief overview on the geographical distribution of yak in the Asian highlands and to provide in-depth information on yak-herding ethnic communities, the sociocultural aspect associated with yak herding, and challenges and emerging opportunities for yak herding in the Asian highlands. Altogether, 31 ethnic groups in 10 different countries of Asia and their cultures are documented herein. Yak was found to be utilized for many different household purposes, and to have cultural and religious aspects. Unfortunately, yak rearing and related traditions have been losing their charm in recent years due to modernization and several other environmental issues. Lastly, we suggest that there is an urgent need to take action to minimize the challenges faced by yak-herding mountain communities to conserve the traditional pastoral system and associated cultures of these ethnic communities.","[Joshi, Srijana; Shrestha, Lily; Bisht, Neha; Ismail, Muhammad; Dorji, Tashi; Dangol, Gauri; Long, Ruijun] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu 44700, Nepal; [Wu, Ning] Chinese Acad Sci, Chengdu Inst Biol, 9 Sect 4,Renmin Nan Rd, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Long, Ruijun] Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, Int Ctr Tibetan Plateau Ecosyst Management, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China",,"Joshi, S; Long, RJ (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu 44700, Nepal.;Long, RJ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, State Key Lab Grassland & Agroecosyst, Int Ctr Tibetan Plateau Ecosyst Management, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",Srijana.Joshi@icimod.org; Lily.Shrestha@icimod.org; neha.bisht16@gmail.com; wuning@cib.ac.cn; Muhammad.Ismail@icimod.org; Tashi.Dorji@icimod.org; gauri.dangol@icimod.org; longrj@lzu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,29.0,32.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2020,12.0,3,,,,,,,957,10.3390/su12030957,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12030957,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000519135104008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The mean range of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks varied from 39.07 to 91.39 Mg C ha(-1) in J. regia and B. utilis forests at 0-30 cm depth, respectively. Among the forest types, the lowest mean range of SOC at three depths (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) was observed in J. regia (18.55, 11.31, and 8.91 Mg C ha(-1), respectively) forest type, and the highest was observed in B. utilis (54.10, 21.68, and 15.60 Mg C ha(-1), respectively) forest type. SOC stocks showed significantly (R-2=0.67, P=0.001) an increasing trend with increase in altitude. On average, the percentages of SOC at 0-10-, 10-20-, and 20-30-cm depths were 53.2, 26.5, and 20.3 %, respectively. Bulk density increased significantly with increase in soil depth and decreased with increase in altitude. Our results suggest that SOC stocks in temperate forests of Kashmir Himalaya vary greatly with forest type and altitude.

In this study, we examine the projected spatiotemporal changes in heat wave characteristics under different climate change scenarios using simulations of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) in seven temperature homogeneous zones of India, i.e., North West (NW), North Central (NC), West Coast (WC), East Coast (EC), Interior Peninsula (IP), Western Himalaya (WH) and North East (NE). The results show that the area of occurrence of a daily maximum temperature above 43 degrees C is projected to increase about 16-fold over WC, 10-fold over EC, and in other zones in the range of 1-3 fold. The warm days are projected to increase fivefold over WC and threefold over NW, EC, IP, and WH. In India, HW days are projected to increase by 7-8 days in the near future (2025-2050) and by 10-17 days in the far future (2076-2100), while under SSP585 over WH (24 days), NW (19 days), and other zones 12-15 days in the far future. EC and WC are plausible to be more vulnerable under SSP370 and SSP585, with an increase in HW intensity (>1.5 degrees C). The area of occurrence of long-lasting heat waves over WC is expected to have a drastic increase of more than 20-fold under all scenarios, while increasing 12-fold over IP and 8-fold over NC, EC, and WH under SSP585.

The relation of biomass carbon was assessed with (1) species type or strata including Cedrus deodara, mixed I (Cedrus deodara-Pinus wallichiana), mixed II (Abies pindrow-Picea smithiana) and Pinus wallichiana, (2) altitude (1292-2911 m amsl), (3) crown density, (4) aspect, (5) tree count or density and (6) location. Using a stratified sampling design, a total of 188 quadrats of 0.1 ha were laid across the entire region representing different biophysical parameters. Field observation including diameter at breast height and height were recorded and sample biomass (t ha(-1)) was estimated using volumetric equations. The observed relation of aboveground biomass carbon with species revealed a trend of mixed II > Cedrus deodara > mixed I > Pinus wallichiana. A positive but weak correlation (R-2 = 0.02) was found between aboveground biomass carbon and altitude. A reasonably good correlation (R-2 = 0.40) was observed to exist between aboveground biomass carbon and crown density. The highest value of average biomass carbon (72.63 t ha(-1)) was recorded for the north-eastern aspect whereas the lowest value (44.60 t ha(-1)) was recorded for the eastern aspect. The aboveground biomass carbon and tree count was found positively correlated (+ 0.475, R-2 = 0.48). Forest biomass carbon fluctuates within the same geographical region with a variety of biophysical factors. The growth rate of species, photosynthetic ability under different crown densities and climatic conditions could address the reasons for this variability.

A widely accepted and recognized QUAL 2Kw model is applied for estimating the water quality parameters on the upper segment of the Yamuna River from Paonta Sahib to Cullackpur. These water quality indicators mainly included electric conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, carbonaceous biological oxygen demand (CBOD), inorganic suspended solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and alkalinity, which were systematically investigated for predicting the spatio-temporal trends during the year 2018. A total of 12 distantly located river sites were identified for sample collection and data validation using QUAL 2Kw model.

One such basin is the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), where the snow- and ice-melt contribution can be more than 80%. Being the origin of some of the world's largest alpine glaciers, this basin could be highly susceptible to global warming and climate change. Field observations and geodetic measurements suggest that in the Karakoram Mountains, glaciers are either stable or have expanded since 1990, in sharp contrast to glacier retreats that are prevalently observed in the Himalayas and adjoining high-altitude terrains of Central Asia. Decreased summer temperature and discharge in the rivers originating from this region are cited as supporting evidence for this somewhat anomalous phenomenon. This study used remote sensing data during the summer months (July-September) for the period 2000 to 2017. Equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) for July, August and September have been estimated. ELA trends for July and September were found statistically insignificant. The August ELA declined by 128 m during 2000-2017 at a rate of 7.1 m/year, testifying to the Karakoram Anomaly concomitant with stable to mass gaining glaciers in the Hunza Basin (western Karakoram). Stable glaciers may store fresh water for longer and provide sustainable river water flows in the near to far future. However, these glaciers are also causing low flows of the river during summer months. The Tarbela reservoir reached three times its lowest storage level during June 2019, and it was argued this was due to the low melt of glaciers in the Karakoram region. Therefore, using remote sensing data to monitor the glaciers' health concomitant with sustainable water resources development and management in the HKH region is urgently needed.","[Attaullah, Haleema; Khan, Asif; Khan, Mujahid; Masud, Tabinda] Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Jalozai Campus, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Khan, Firdos] Natl Univ Sci & Technol NUST, Sch Nat Sci SNS, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Ali, Shaukat] Minist Climate Change, Global Change Impact Studies Ctr GCISC, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Iqbal, Muhammad Shahid] Int Water Management Inst IWMI, Lahore 54782, Pakistan",,"Khan, A (corresponding author), Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Jalozai Campus, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan.",asifkhan@uetpeshawar.edu.pk,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,14.0,19,,,,,,,3157,10.3390/w14193157,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14193157,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000867301400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Glacier extraction from satellite images is an essential step in large-scale area change monitoring. However, glacier extraction is usually influenced by cloud cover and seasonal snow, and thus far, there is no effective and automatic method to monitor glacier area change in large regions. In this study, a new method `multi-temporal minimum NDSI composite' is proposed for clean glacier and nonseasonal snow extraction, and the results agree well with the glacier inventory (excluding the debris part), except in Himalayan regions where non-seasonal snow exists widely out of glaciers. This method is also used to estimate the glacier and nonseasonal snow area changes in High Mountain Asia (HMA) over the past 29 years. With this method, we can use abundant Landsat images of summer seasons from continuous years to composite a cloud-free and seasonal snow-free glacial image pixel by pixel. Glacial maps for the whole HMA are produced every 10 years beginning in 1990, so glacier changes are presented in different subregions and periods. The number of images which is used to composite a glacial map in each pixel is also given for uncertainty analysis. According to the results, the clean glacier and nonseasonal snow area in HMA decreased by -0.43 +/- 0.19%/a during 1990-2018 but had high temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Clean glacier and nonseasonal snow area decreased rapidly during 1990-2000, slowed down during 2000-2010, and then sped up during 2010-2018. The fastest reductions were in Hengduan Shan at rates of approximately -1.05 +/- 0.09%/a, and the only area with growth (at a rate of 0.50 +/- 0.11%/a) was in West Kun Lun during 1990-2018.","[Huang, Lei; Li, Zhen; Zhou, Jian Min; Zhang, Ping] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Key Lab Digital Earth, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",,"Li, Z (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Key Lab Digital Earth, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",lizhen@radi.ac.cn,,,,,,,,19.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1,2021,258.0,,,,,,,,112376,10.1016/j.rse.2021.112376,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2021.112376,,MAR 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000637770200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper presents results of the inter-annual variability of Net Primary Productivity (NPP) from 1981 to 2000 derived using observations from NOAA-AVHRR data using Global Production Efficiency Model (GloPEM). The GloPEM model is based on physiological principles and uses the production efficiency concept, in which the canopy absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) is used with a conversion efficiency to estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP). NPP derived from GloPEM model over India showed maximum NPP about 3,000 gCm(-2)year(-1) in west Bengal and lowest up to 500 gCm(-2)year(-1) in Rajasthan. The India averaged NPP varied from 1,084.7 gCm(-2)year(-1) to 1,390.8 gCm(-2)year(-1) in the corresponding years of 1983 and 1998 respectively. The regression analysis of the 20 year NPP variability showed significant increase in NPP over India (r = 0.7, F = 17.53, p < 0.001). The mean rate of increase was observed as 10.43 gCm(-2)year(-1). Carbon fixation ability of terrestrial ecosystem of India is increasing with rate of 34.3 TgC annually (t = 4.18, p < 0.001). The estimated net carbon fixation over Indian landmass ranged from 3.56 PgC (in 1983) to 4.57 PgC (in 1998). Grid level temporal correlation analysis showed that agricultural regions are the source of increase in terrestrial NPP of India. Parts of forest regions (Himalayan in Nepal, north east India) are relatively less influenced over the study period and showed lower or negative correlation (trend). Finding of the study would provide valuable input in understanding the global change associated with vegetation activities as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide.","[Singh, R. P.; Goroshi, S.

In order to foresee future changes in water quality, it is important to understand what pressures are governing the spatial variation in water chemistry. In this paper the chemistry including major ions and trace elements in the headwaters of four major Asian rivers (i.e. the Salween, Mekong, Yangtze River and Yarlung Tsangpo) in the Tibetan Plateau was studied. The results showed that the content of dissolved salts in these Tibetan rivers was relatively high compared to waters from other parts of the world. The chemical composition of the four rivers were rather similar, with Ca(2+) and HCO(3)(-) being the dominating ions. The exception was the Yangtze River on the Plateau, which was enriched in Na(+), Cl(-), SO(4)(2-) and Li due to silicate weathering followed by strong evaporation caused by a negative water balance, dissolution of evaporites in the catchment and some drainage from saline lakes. The concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Co, Cr. Ni, Cd, Pb, and Hg) and As, NH(4)(+) were generally low in all the rivers. Anthropogenic impacts on the quality of the rivers were identified at a few locations in the Mekong River and Yarlung Tsangpo basins. Generally, the main spatial variation in chemical compositions of these under studied rivers was found to be governed mainly by difference in geological variation and regional climatic-environment. Climate change is, therefore, one of main determining factors on the water chemical characteristics of these headwaters of Asian major rivers in the Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

They play a critical role in the ecological chain, human production and life. With a vast territory, China has rich plant species and complex geographical regions, and research on the distribution of plant diversity in China is significant for utilising, developing, and protecting biological resources. This study aimed to study plant diversity in China. It obtained the plant diversity distribution data in China, then analysed it via spectral clustering and visualised it via Echarts. It was found that Yunnan records the most considerable plant diversity, followed by Sichuan and Tibet, meaning that the Southwestern part of China has the most extensive plant diversity. While it is expected that Tibet and Yunnan have backward economic development and hence a lower level of human destruction on plant diversity, Sichuan's economic development is quite good. The land of abundance still has a wide variety of plants owing to excellent irrigation projects since 256BC. Besides, the Hengduan Mountains were the main route for Chinese plants to migrate from the west to the east, which might be closely related to the Himalayan orogeny. The Himalayan orogeny promotes the formation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is a vital factor in the biodiversity formation in China. This study provides a basis for China's conservation and study and enhances our understanding of plant biodiversity. As plant biodiversity increases soil organic carbon storage, it offers insights into carbon neutrality practitioners and researchers.","[Li, Ping] Wuhan Business Univ, Sch Int Educ, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Li, Rita Yi Man] Hong Kong Shue Yan Univ, Sustainable Real Estate Res Ctr, Dept Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hong] Anhui Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Languages & Media, Bengbu, Peoples R China; [Cao, Yong] Southwest Forestry Univ, Sch Big Data & Intelligence Engn, Kunming, Peoples R China; [Kaabar, Mohammed K.

The current study validates the practical capability and usefulness of this tool for simulating complex nonlinear, real world, river system processes in the Himalayan scenario. The modeling approach is based on the time series data collected from January to December (2008-2010) for Q and SSC. Three ANNs (T1-T3) with different network configurations have been developed and trained using the Levenberg Marquardt Back Propagation Algorithm in the Matlab routines. Networks were optimized using the enumeration technique, and, finally, the best network is used to predict the SSC values for the year 2011. The values thus obtained through the ANN model are compared with the observed values of SSC. The coefficient of determination (R-2), for the optimal network was found to be 0.99. The study not only provides insight into ANN modeling in the Himalayan river scenario, but it also focuses on the importance of understanding a river basin and the factors that affect the SSC, before attempting to model it. Despite the temporal variations in the study area, it is possible to model and successfully predict the SSC values with very simplistic ANN models.

It is characterized by southwestern regional slope and is made up of sediments derived from the Himalayan front. The southern part of the Haryana-Punjab plain has a narrow northeast sloping surface, made up of sediments derived from the Rajasthan craton, making the peripheral bulge of the basin. The area of interaction of these two opposing slopes is marked by a rather flat region of poor drainage with a number of water bodies. This interactive zone of the two slopes has a constricted belt of westerly outlet merging in the Indus alluvial plain. The excessive sediments derived from the Himalayan front formed mega-fans, which in Late Pleistocene, extended down to 200 m altitude close to the southern limit of Haryana-Punjab plain. There are geomorphic evidence of punctuations in reduction in fan building activity during Late Quaternary with terminations at 225 and 300 m altitude, prominently seen in satellite imagery and Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The Haryana-Punjab plain also exhibits undulations with prominent highgrounds around Bhatinda, Hissar, and Sonipat-Jind. During the Late Quaternary, the streams of Yamuna-Sutlej interfluve region, viz., Dangri (sometimes referred as Tangri), Ghaggar-Saraswati, Markanda and Chautang,. drastically reduced their carrying capacity due to reduced monsoon activity and neotectonic block movements. These streams abort within their terminal fans.

A combined inorganic chemical, algal and bacterial survey (using flow cytometry and 16S rRNA gene sequencing) along the upper and middle Ganga (from the Himalayan foothills to Kanpur) was conducted under pre-monsoon conditions. The upper Ganga had total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved nitrogen concentrations of less than 100 mu g l(-1)and 1.0 mg l(-1), but water quality declined at Kannauj (TP = 420 mu g l(-1)) due to major nutrient pollution inputs from human-impacted tributaries (principally the Ramganga and Kali Rivers). The phosphorus and nitrogen loads in these two tributaries and the Yamuna were dominated by soluble reactive phosphorus and ammonium, with high bacterial loads and large numbers of taxa indicative of pathogen and faecal organisms, strongly suggesting sewage pollution sources. The high nutrient concentrations, low flows, warm water and high solar radiation resulted in major algal blooms in the Kali and Ramganga, which greatly impacted the Ganga. Microbial communities were dominated by members of the Phylum Proteobacteria, Bacteriodetes and Cyanobacteria, with communities showing a clear upstream to downstream transition in community composition. To improve the water quality of the middle Ganga, and decrease ecological and human health risks, future mitigation must reduce urban wastewater inputs in the urbanised tributaries of the Ramganga, Kali and Yamuna Rivers.","[Bowes, Michael J.; Read, Daniel S.; Armstrong, Linda K.; Nicholls, David J.

Mercury (Hg) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have global transport capacity and are regulated by the Minamata Convention and Stockholm Convention, respectively. Since the beginning of this century, understanding of the origin and fate of Hg and POPs on the Tibetan Plateau (TP, also known as the third pole) has been deepening. In this paper, the existing literature is reviewed to comprehensively understand the atmospheric transport, atmospheric deposition, cumulative transformation and accumulation of Hg and POPs on the TP region under the background of global warming. The biogeochemical cycle of both Hg and POPs has the following environmental characteristics: (1) the Indian summer monsoon and westerly winds carry Hg and POPs inland to the TP; (2) the cold trapping effect causes Hg and POPs to be deposited on the TP by dry and wet deposition, making glaciers, permafrost, and snow the key sinks of Hg and POPs; (3) Hg and POPs can subsequently be released due to the melting of glaciers and permafrost; (4) bioaccumulation and biomagnification of Hg and POPs have been examined in the aquatic food chain; (5) ice cores and lake cores preserve the impacts of both regional emissions and glacial melting on Hg and POP migration. This implies that comprehensive models will be needed to evaluate the fate and toxicity of Hg and POPs on larger spatial and longer temporal scales to forecast their projected tendencies under diverse climate scenarios. Future policies and regulations should address the disrupted repercussions of inclusive CC such as weather extremes, floods and storms, and soil sustainable desertification on the fate of Hg and POPs. The present findings advocate the strengthening of the cross-national programs aimed at the elimination of Hg and POPs in polar (Arctic, Antarctic and TP) and certain mountainous (the Himalaya, Rocky Mountains, and Alps) ecosystems for better understanding the impacts of global warming on the accumulation of Hg/POPs in cold and remote areas.","[Chai, Lei; Zhou, Yunqiao; Wang, Xiaoping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resource, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,"Wang, XP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resource, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Wang, XP (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",wangxp@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 19,2022,24.0,10,,,,,1616,1630,,10.1039/d1em00550b,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1em00550b,,JUN 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000820061800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, for most parts of the world, comprehensive species data with acceptable quality are still scarce to support regional priority evaluations. To model the factors that favor a high/important degree of biodiversity and threats; in this study, we provide an alternative conservation priority approach to use when species data are insufficient. Based on a Landsat-derived forest cover map of 2010 of the Eastern Himalaya of China, we defined forest nodes, measured and delineated their importance with the connectivity metric dPC at regional and sub regional scales. Based on a deforestation map of 2000 to 2010, we simulated deforestation from 2010 to 2030 using the Dinamica EGO software at multiple scales, and calculated the threatened degree of each forest node at an optimal scale. We then ranked the conservation priorities by coupling the measurements of the connectivity importance values and simulated threatened degree of each important forest node. Six forest patches (2.5% of remaining forest in 2010) were ranked as conservation priority patch-I and II. The unprotected parts are recommended to be expanded into or established as new nature reserves. Although species information was not used, the identified forest patches accommodated existing nature reserves (48% overlapped) in this region. As a fast and efficient assessment approach, with outcomes that are valuable for regional conservation planning, this method could be widely used for any forest dominant regions when field data is insufficient to identify conservation priorities at a fine scale.

We have validated the biological richness index for three states generated in 'Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level' project under the aegis of Department of Biotechnology and Department of Space of the Government of India. Biological Richness (BR) index, described elsewhere as a cumulative property of ecological habitats and surroundings; was analyzed as an integrated 'three-tier modeling approach' of (i) utilization of geospatial tools, (ii) limited field survey and (iii) landscape analysis. For validation, we categorized the field plots into 10-groups corresponding to 10-levels of BR using data splitting technique using their GPS-recorded positional information. In general, the number of tree, shrub and liana species and mean BA demonstrated a decreasing trend with lowering of BR for all three states falling under both the hotspots. However, the number of endemic species increased with decrease in BR levels for Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh; and decreased for the state of Assam. The study validates the BR index derived using geospatial modeling approach, thereby provides confidence in its acceptance for ecological conservation purposes.","[Behera, M.

J,"ul Hasson, S",,,,"ul Hasson, Shabeh",,,Seasonality of Precipitation over Himalayan Watersheds in CORDEX South Asia and their Driving CMIP5 Experiments,ATMOSPHERE,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Since the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) experiments exhibit limited skill in reproducing the statistical properties of prevailing precipitation regimes over the major Himalayan watersheds (Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra and Mekong), this study evaluates the anticipated added skill of their dynamically refined simulations performed under the framework of Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiments for South Asia (CX-SA). For this, the fidelity of eight CX-SA experiments against their six driving CMIP5 experiments is assessed for the historical period (1971-2005) in terms of time-dependent statistical properties (onset/retreat timings and rapid fractional accumulation-RFA) of the dominant summer monsoonal precipitation regime (MPR). Further, a self-defining seasonality index (SI), which is a product of precipitation and the distance of its actual distribution relative to its uniform distribution (relative entropy-RE), has been computed for MPR, westerly precipitation regime (WPR) and annual precipitation. The time evolution of precipitation, RE and SI has also been analyzed. Results suggest that CX-SA experiments simulate even higher wet biases than their driving CMIP5 experiments over all study basins, mainly due to higher wet biases simulated over the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau. Most of the CX-SA experiments suggest unrealistic timings of the monsoon onset that are far earlier than their driving CMIP5 experiments for all basins. Generally, CX-SA experiments feature higher underestimation of RFAslope, RE and SI, distancing their driving CMIP5 experiments farther from observations. Interestingly, regardless of the diverse skill of CMIP5 experiments, their fine scale CX-SA experiments exhibit quite a similar skill when downscaled by the same regional climate model (RCM), indicating RCM's ability to considerably alter the driving datasets. These findings emphasize on improving the fidelity of simulated precipitation regimes over the Himalayan watersheds by exploiting the potential of RCMs in term of microphysics, resolutions and convective closures, and preferably, on resolving the crucial fine scale processes further down to their representative (meso-to-local) scales.","[ul Hasson, Shabeh] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, CEN, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [ul Hasson, Shabeh] Inst Space Technol, Dept Space Sci, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",,"ul Hasson, S (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, CEN, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.;ul Hasson, S (corresponding author), Inst Space Technol, Dept Space Sci, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",shabeh.hasson@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,,18.0,18.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2016,7.0,10,,,,,,,123,10.3390/atmos7100123,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos7100123,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000388284600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

As nutrients availability is influenced by soil heterogeneity, climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities; hence, delineation of nutrient management zones (MZs) based on spatial variability could be an effective management option at regional scale. Thus, the present study was carried out to delineate MZs in the Shiwalik Himalayan region of India by capturing spatial variability of soil properties and secondary and micronutrients status because of the emerging nutrient deficiencies. For the study, a total of 2575 geo-referenced representative surface (0-15 cm depth) soil samples were collected from the study region covering an area of 53,483 km(2). The soils were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, soil organic carbon, available sulphur (S) and micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, B and Mo) concentrations. There was a wide variation in soil properties with coefficient of variation values of 14 (for pH) to 86% for available Mo. Geostatistical analysis revealed spherical, Gaussian, exponential, stable, circular and K-Bessel best-fit models for soil properties. Most of the soil properties were having moderate spatial dependence except soil pH and S (strong spatial dependence) and Zn (weak spatial dependence). About 49%, 10%, 2%, 13%, 11%, 12% and 8% area of the study region were found to be deficient (including acute and marginal deficiency) in S, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, B and Mo, respectively. The principal component analysis and fuzzy c-mean clustering were performed to develop the MZs. Four principal components with eigenvalues greater than 1 and accounting 65.4% of total variance were retained for further analysis. On the basis of fuzzy performance index and normalized classification entropy, four potential MZs were identified. Analysis of variance confirmed the heterogeneity in most of the studied soil properties among the MZs. The study indicated that the methodology of delineating MZs can be effectively used in site-specific S and micronutrients management in the Shiwalik Himalayan region of India.

Field studies were carried out using the British River Habitat Survey (RHS) method. Habitat quality was analyzed based on the following indicators: Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) and Habitat Modification Score (HMS). The obtained results indicated that sections of mountain streams located in upper catchment areas show greater habitat naturalness in relation to stream sections in lower areas. This results from the greater variety and number of natural hydromorphological elements in streams and the close vicinity of channels. In both upper and lower stream sections, regardless of the degree of naturalness and anthropopressure, the same RHS attributes have the greatest impact on the HQA and HMS values.

Its variation plays an important role in glacier dynamics, mass balance, and climate change. The Muztag-Kongur Mountains are an important glacier region in the Eastern Pamir Plateau. Under the background of global warming, the glacier velocity variation has been widely considered, but details of the inter-annual and intra-annual changes have not been clear. In this study, we explored the inter-annual and intra-annual variations in the glacier velocity from 1990 to 2021, and the influencing factors, based on Landsat images, Inter-Mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE), and Karakoram Highway (KKH) data product analysis. The results showed the following: (1) the glacier velocity has increased since 1990, and significant growth occurred in 1995-1996. (2) A transverse profile of two typical glaciers was used to analyze the monthly variation in glacier velocity during the year. The peaks of monthly velocity occurred in May and August. (3) Since 1990, the inter-annual precipitation has increased, and the temperature increase slowed down from 2000 to 2013. The trend of inter-annual glacier velocity variation was consistent with that of the precipitation. The glacier velocity peaked in 1996/1997 due to increased precipitation in 1995. The glacier velocity over the year was consistent with the monthly precipitation trends, which indicates that precipitation has a significant influence on the change in glacier velocity. (4) In addition to temperature and precipitation, the glacier velocity variation was moderately correlated with the glacier size (length and area) and weakly correlated with the slope. The spatial distribution of glaciers shows that the spatial heterogeneity of glaciers in the Muztag-Kongur Mountains is affected by the westerly circulation. The long-term glacier velocity variation research of the Muztag-Kongur Mountains will contribute to a better understanding of glacier dynamics within the context of climatic warming, and the different influencing factors were analyzed to further explain the glacier velocity variation.","[Huang, Danni; Jiang, Ling; Shahtahmassebi, AmirReza; Huang, Xiaoli] Chuzhou Univ, Coll Geog Informat & Tourism, Chuzhou 239000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhen; Lu, Yijie] Anhui Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Spatial Informat & Geomat, Huainan 232001, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Rui] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geosci & Environm Engn, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Rui] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, State Prov Joint Engn Lab Spatial Informat Technol, Chengdu 611756, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, L (corresponding author), Chuzhou Univ, Coll Geog Informat & Tourism, Chuzhou 239000, Peoples R China.",ling.jiang@chzu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2023,15.0,3,,,,,,,620,10.3390/rs15030620,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15030620,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000930728300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The estimation of the stream flow under future climatic projections is a pre-requisite to manage water resources properly. This study focused on the simulation of snowmelt-runoff using Snowmelt-Runoff Model (SRM) under the current and future Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) climate scenarios in the two main tributaries of the UIB namely the Astore and the Hunza River basins. Remote sensing data from Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) along with in-situ hydro-climatic data was used as input to the SRM. Basin-wide and zone-wise approaches were used in the SRM. For the zone-wise approach, basin areas were sliced into five elevation zones and the mean temperature for the zones with no weather stations was estimated using a lapse rate value of -0.48 degrees C to -0.76 degrees C/100 m in both studied basins. Zonal snow cover was estimated for each zone by reclassifying the MODIS snow maps according to the zonal boundaries. SRM was calibrated over 2000-2001 and validated over the 2002-2004 data period. The results implied that the SRM simulated the river flow efficiently with Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.90 (0.86) and 0.86 (0.86) for the basin-wide (zone-wise) approach in the Astore and Hunza River Basins, respectively, over the entire simulation period. Mean annual discharge was projected to increase by 11-58% and 14-90% in the Astore and Hunza River Basins, respectively, under all the RCP mid- and late-21st-century scenarios. Mean summer discharge was projected to increase between 10-60% under all the RCP scenarios of mid- and late-21st century in the Astore and Hunza basins.

In Bangladesh, out of 64 districts, the groundwater of 50 and 59 districts contains As exceeding the Bangladesh (50 mu g/L) and WHO (10 mu g/L) standards for potable water. This review focuses on the occurrence, origin, plausible sources, and mobilization mechanisms of As in the groundwater of Bangladesh to better understand its environmental as well as public health consequences. High As concentrations mainly was mainly occur from the natural origin of the Himalayan orogenic tract. Consequently, sedimentary processes transport the As-loaded sediments from the orogenic tract to the marginal foreland of Bangladesh, and under the favorable biogeochemical circumstances, As is discharged from the sediment to the groundwater. Rock weathering, regular floods, volcanic movement, deposition of hydrochemical ore, and leaching of geological formations in the Himalayan range cause As occurrence in the groundwater of Bangladesh. Redox and desorption processes along with microbe-related reduction are the key geochemical processes for As enrichment. Under reducing conditions, both reductive dissolution of Fe-oxides and desorption of As are the root causes of As mobilization. A medium alkaline and reductive environment, resulting from biochemical reactions, is the major factor mobilizing As in groundwater. An elevated pH value along with decoupling of As and HCO3- plays a vital role in mobilizing As. The As mobilization process is related to the reductive solution of metal oxides as well as hydroxides that exists in sporadic sediments in Bangladesh. Other mechanisms, such as pyrite oxidation, redox cycling, and competitive ion exchange processes, are also postulated as probable mechanisms of As mobilization. The reductive dissolution of MnOOH adds dissolved As and redox-sensitive components such as SO42- and oxidized pyrite, which act as the major mechanisms to mobilize As. The reductive suspension of Mn(IV)-oxyhydroxides has also accelerated the As mobilization process in the groundwater of Bangladesh. Infiltration from the irrigation return flow and surface-wash water are also potential factors to remobilize As. Over-exploitation of groundwater and the competitive ion exchange process are also responsible for releasing As into the aquifers of Bangladesh.","[Huq, Md Enamul; Shao, Zhenfeng] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Fahad, Shah; Sarven, Most Sinthia] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, Shizishan St 1, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fahad, Shah; Khan, Imtiaz Ali; Alam, Mukhtar; Saeed, Muhammad; Ullah, Hidayat; Adnan, Muahmmad; Wahid, Fazli; Zamin, Muhammad; Raza, Mian Ahmad; Saeed, Beena] Univ Swabi, Dept Agr, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan; [Saud, Shah] Northeast Agr Univ, Dept Hort, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Qimin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Informat & Commun, 1037 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Ali, Shaukat] Minist Climate Change, GCISC, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ali, Shaukat] Alberta Environm & Pk, Environm Monitoring & Sci Div, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Riaz, Muhammad] Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Allama Iqbal Rd, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Khan, Wasif Ullah] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol Sci & Biotechnol, Natl Engn Lab Tree Breeding, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Shao, ZF (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.;Fahad, S (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, Shizishan St 1, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China.",shah_fahad80@yahoo.com; shaozhenfeng@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,91.0,96.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 15,2020,262.0,,,,,,,,110318,10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110318,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110318,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000527016200043,View Full Record in Web of Science

Precipitation-related extremes has substantial socioeconomic impacts under the changing climate. Quantifying population exposure to precipitation extreme is the fundamental aspect of population risk assessments in the climate hotspot of Indus River Basin. This study investigates the population exposure to precipitation extremes at 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C global warmings in the Indus River Basin using daily precipitation data, and projected population under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The Intensity-Area-Duration method was applied to detect the extreme precipitation event by tracing the rainstorm process, calculated based on five downscaled and bias-corrected Global Climate Model (GCM) outputs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). The exposure of the population is finally estimated by combing SSP1 with 1.5 degrees C, SSP2 with 2.0 degrees C, and SSP5 with 3.0 degrees C warming levels. Results show that warming over the Indus River Basin is projected to be higher than that of the global average. Both the extreme precipitation events and population exposure are projected to increase with warming level. With regard to the reference period (1986-2005), the frequency, duration, and impacted area of extreme precipitation are projected to increase by 13.2%, 7.4%, and 1.6% annually under 1.5 degrees C in the Indus River Basin, respectively. Whereas, an additional 0.5 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C warming can lead to further increase in the frequency of 16.6%, 17.3%, as well as the duration of 8.6%, 12%, and areal coverage of 2.1%, 5.3%, respectively. The population exposure to extreme precipitation is projected to increase by 72.4%, 122.7%, and 87.6%, respectively, at SSP1 with 1.5 degrees C, SSP2 with 2.0 degrees C and SSP5 with 3.0 degrees C warming levels compare to the reference period. The demographic change is responsible more for the tremendous increment of population exposure in the Indus River Basin. If the population was held constant to the level of 2010, the increase of population exposure would be 4.4%, 8.8%, and 17.6%, respectively, at 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C warming levels. Spatially, the prominent increment of population exposure is projected in the central and southwestern Indus River Basin. This study highlights that limiting the increase of temperature to 1.5 degrees C can substantially reduce population exposure to extreme precipitation events in the Indus River Basin, compared to an additional warming. Simultaneously, urge paid to formulate policies on population growth to reduce future exposure.","[Zhao Jian-Ting; Su Bu-Da; Mondal, Sanjit Kumar; Wang Yan-Jun; Jiang Tong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Inst Disaster Risk Management, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Su Bu-Da; Tao Hui; Jiang Tong] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, T (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Inst Disaster Risk Management, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",jiangtong@cma.gov.cn,,,,,,,,22.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2021,12.0,2,,,,,199,209,,10.1016/j.accre.2021.03.005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.accre.2021.03.005,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000654345800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The net annual carbon sequestration rates were achieved for fast growing short rotation poplar (8 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1)) and Eucalyptus (6 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1)) plantations followed by moderate growing teak forests (2 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1)) and slow growing long rotation sal forests (1 Mg Cha(-1)yr(-1)). Due to fast growth rate and adaptability to a range of environments, short rotation plantations, in addition to carbon storage rapidly produce biomass for energy and contribute to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. We also used the model to evaluate the effect of changing rotation length and thinning regime on carbon stocks of forest ecosystem (trees+soil) and wood products, respectively for sal and teak forests. The carbon stock in soil and products was less sensitive than carbon stock of trees to the change in rotation length. Extending rotation length from the recommended 120 to 150 years increased the average carbon stock of forest ecosystem (trees+soil) by 12%. The net primary productivity was highest (3.7 Mg ha(-1)yr(-1)) when a 60-year rotation length was applied but decreased with increasing rotation length (e.g., 1.7 Mg ha(-1)yr(-1)) at 150 years. Goal of maximum carbon storage and production of more valuable saw logs can be achieved from longer rotation lengths. 'No thinning' has the largest biomass, but from an economical perspective, there will be no wood available from thinning operations to replace fossil fuel for bioenergy and to the pulp industry and such patches have high risks of forest fires, insects etc. Extended rotation lengths and reduced thinning intensity could enhance the long-term capacity of forest ecosystems to sequester carbon. While accounting for effects of climate change, a combination of bioenergy and carbon sequestration will be best to mitigation of CO2 emission in the long term.","[Kaul, Meenakshi; Mohren, G. M.

Studies on amphibian larval habitat use are limited, especially from modified habitats. We investigated the habitat availability and use patterns of overwintering tadpoles of the Nanorana frog in an anthropogenically modified stream in the western Himalaya. Habitat was assessed in terms of depth, velocity, substrate type, and instream cover. We quantified the microhabitat preference of the tadpoles to develop habitat suitability criteria (HSC) curves, the biological component of habitat simulation tools used in instream flow management. We analyzed the data covering winter and post-winter seasons using cumulative link mixed models to understand the influence of check dams and seasons on the hydraulic properties of microhabitats used by the tadpoles. We confirm the influence of check dam and season on velocity and the influence of season on depth used by the tadpoles. Based on this, we generated HSCs for tadpoles occurring in natural and modified pools during both seasons. We recommend intermediate water depths (30-60 cm) during the low flow season to sustain the tadpole population in the study stream and other required habitat features. The study underlines the importance of spatial and temporal variation in the habitat suitability for Nanorana tadpoles. These HSCs can be used in hydrological models for estimating the minimum ecological flow for overwintering tadpoles in the study area. A large-scale study based on the recommendations can lead to a better conservation plan in light of altered streamflow in the western Himalaya region.","[Jithin, Vijayan] Wildlife Inst India, Postgrad Programme Wildlife Sci, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Das, Abhijit] Wildlife Inst India, Dept Endangered Species Management, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Johnson, Jeyaraj A.] Wildlife Inst India, Dept Habitat Ecol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India",,"Johnson, JA (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, Dept Habitat Ecol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttarakhand, India.",jaj@wii.gov.in,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2022,38.0,9,,,,,1629,1641,,10.1002/rra.4033,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.4033,,AUG 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000835173000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Satellite observations successfully provide a global and comprehensive hemispheric-scale record of the short-term, as well as inter-seasonal variations in snow cover. Passive microwave sensors provide an excellent method to monitor temporal and spatial variations in large-scale snow cover parameters, overcoming problems of cloud cover. Using microwave remote sensing data, snow parameters (snow surface temperature, snow water equivalence, scattering index, emissivity, snow depth) have been retrieved to integrate with the snow cover simulation model developed by SASE for avalanche risk assessment on regional basis. Multispectral and multitemporal brightness temperature data obtained from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), flown onboard the DMSP satellites, for the period November 2000 to April 2001 and from November 2001 to February 2002 have been analysed. A comparative data set on snow measurements and meteorological observations of a region covering large area of Pir-Panjal and the Greater Himalayan range, available on near real time basis from SASE Field observatories were also used. Model calculations were carried out to study the effects of atmospheric transmission on the microwave radiation emitted from the snow covered and snow free ground and atmosphere. The sensitivity of combinations of the SSM/I channels at 19, 37 and 85 GHz, in both horizontal and vertical polarizations, in respect to snow depth, surface temperature of the snowpack have been carried out.

The species collected from 14 sites, enroute from Dehradun to Morinda (243 Km) including the trekking route 42 Km from Taluka to Morinda having an altitudinal gradient between 850-3,750 m, were analysed for their metals and PAHs. The species showed similar metal as well as PAHs profile under similar altitudinal gradients in the sequence of F. caperata > P. hispidula > P. sorediata. The difference in pollutant concentrations within each lichen species may be related to intrinsic attributes of the species, such as thallus morphology and the presence of lichen substances which are responsible for the sensitivity and accumulation potential of a particular species. Novelty of the present study lies on the fact that all the species show a similar efficiency of reflecting the environmental condition of the area, albeit the coefficient values of individual species for individual pollutant obtained by three-factor ANOVA revealed that the bioaccumulation affinity of F. caperata is significantly higher than P. hispidula and P. sorediata. For individual metals, F. caperata has a higher affinity for Al, Cr, Fe, Pb and Zn while P. hispidula has a significant positive affinity for Fe and Pb. PCA analysis of sites with respect to pollutant revealed the segregation of sites based on source and distance. Combining the bioaccumulation potential parameters along with geostatistical (GIS) techniques establishes that F. caperata species is a better accumulator of metals and PAHs in comparison to P. hispidula and P. sorediata in the temperate regions of the Himalaya.","[Bajpai, Rajesh; Shukla, Vertika; Upreti, D.

The efficiency of snow/ice-melt-runoff model and snowy/Himalayan watershed model depends on the estimation accuracy of the mean SLA for varying saturated snow cover (melting area) within seasonal and permanent SLA. Remotely sensed data are still in the phase of development to present quick and dependable input of SLA. This study is aimed to predict seasonal SLA, annual equilibrium line altitude (ELA), maximum annual SLA, melting zone, and their intraseasonal or/and interannual variations based on observed temperature in a watershed of the western Himalayas. The study area extends from 2,100 to 6,000 m altitudes (latitude: 32 degrees 10'N to 32 degrees 25'N; longitude: 77 degrees E to 77 degrees 40'E). Varying catchment participation (VCP) zonal altitude of melting and simulated relation naming applied basic oscillation (ABO) have been developed for SLA movement on weekly and monthly mean temperature data and simulation of monthly observed/estimated SLA, respectively. The VCP results suggested an upward shift of spring SLA by 700 m in March, whereas ABO results showed a 300-m upward shift of ELA during September in two decades from the 1980s. The VCP calibration parameters-temperature lapse rate of 0.554 degrees C/100 m and saturated SLA mean air temperature of 5.75 degrees C-have been designed to predict SLA using temperature and ablating snowpack at Solang (2,485 m altitude). The periodical shift in SLA has been verified with the snow cover disappearance data and combined impact of temperature and solar radiation at two stations. The VCP-computed SLA and ELA varied by +/- 5% with observed values, whereas the error in ABO-predicted monthly SLA including ELAwas +/- 4%.

We generated habitat suitability criteria (HSC) curves for BNC based on the habitat availability in the river channel and use by the BNC. The HSC curves indicated that BNC preferred velocity ranged from 0 to 0.2 m/s and depth ranged from 0 to 30 cm in the river channel. Based on the HSCs of BNC, three scenarios were explored in PHABSIM: Scenario (i) increase in flow versus dry riverbed area; Scenario (ii) increase in flow versus instream suitable area; Scenario (iii) increase in flow versus weighted usable area based on combined dry and instream suitable area. The output of Scenario (i) indicated at 20 cumecs discharge achieved optimum dry riverbed area (47.07%) available for BNC, whereas Scenario (ii) predicted the different section of the river produced optimum instream area at different discharges. Though, the Scenario (iii) predicted at 20 cumecs discharge, the study area generated more than 57.38% of combined suitable habitat available for BNC. Since a proposed hydropower dam in the Zemithang valley is intend to raise water level in the river channel, it is expected to be reduced suitable habitat for BNC in the valley. Based on the PHABSIM output, we concluded that the availability of suitable habitat of BNC decreases steadily if the discharge flow increases above 20 cumecs. Moreover, the predicted average dry riverbed area (47.07%) at 20 cumecs was almost equal to the percentage of dry riverbed area (47.8%) that was naturally available during the winter. Thus, we recommend a maximum of 20 cumecs as ecological flows to maintain the minimum required habitats for wintering BNC in the Nyamjang Chu River. Consequently, the installation of the proposed dam in Zemithang valley may not be feasible.","[Johnson, Jeyaraj A.; Watham, Taibanganba; Gopi, Govindan V.; Sivakumar, Kuppusamy] Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Watham, Taibanganba] Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India",,"Johnson, JA (corresponding author), Wildlife Inst India, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.",jaj@wii.gov.in,,,,,,,,1.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2021,37.0,3,,,,,321,329,,10.1002/rra.3752,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3752,,NOV 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000591804700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The type and amount of clay present in the alluvial fan sediments account for the prevailing climate, topography, transport dynamics, diagenesis, and lithology of the catchment area. Clay mineral analysis of sediments collected from the younger lobe of Kiratpur Fan, Pinjaur dun, NW Himalaya, will help to understand the late-Quaternary climatic perturbations during marine isotope stage (MIS)-3 and to evaluate the suitability of clay minerals as paleoclimatic proxy. Materials and methods Samples were collected from three sites along the Kiratpur Nadi near Paploha village, Haryana, where exposed sections had a total height of similar to 28 m. In this study, 31 samples from these sediment sections were collected and after initial processing, clay minerals were separated and oriented slides were prepared. These samples were analysed using X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with/without glycolation and heating treatments. One aliquot of dried clay from selected samples were used for FTIR to complement the XRD analysis. For FTIR analysis, about 1 mg of clay samples was mixed with similar to 10 mg of KBr and press pellets were prepared. Results and discussion The clay fraction of these sediments constitute illite (similar to 52 +/- 0.8%), kaolinite (similar to 13 +/- 1.6%), and chlorite-montmorillonite interstratified clay (similar to 35 +/- 1.5%). Shale and mudstone distributed in the catchment area might be the source of these clay minerals. Illite chemistry index of similar to 0.37 +/- 0.14, kaolinite/illite ratio (0.21-0.29), illite crystallinity (IC) (0.23 +/- 0.04), and kaolinite percentage suggest the dominance of physical weathering in the catchment area. These sediments are generated during a cold and dry period, and deposited during an aggradational phase associated with warm and wet phase within MIS-3 (40-30 Ka). Further, it was found that illite is the dominant clay throughout the Himalayas, Ganga plain, and Bay of Bengal (BoB) sediments, irrespective of their distance from the source. Hence, associating illite to younger and less-transported sediment does not work in this setting. Conclusion Though the proxies based on clay percentage is very useful, only limited data is available. There is a significant difference in the value of IC in the Himalayan front and BoB sediments may be due to the modifications during the transportation of sediments. Overall, when sediments are transported for a longer distance, correlating clay mineral percentage with the maturity of sediment is not apparent.","[Amrutha, K.; Ahmad, Samad; Pattanaik, Jitendra Kumar] Cent Univ Punjab, Dept Geol, Bathinda 151401, Punjab, India; [Kumar, Pankaj] Inter Univ Accelerator Ctr, AMS & Geochronol Grp, New Delhi 110067, India",,"Pattanaik, JK (corresponding author), Cent Univ Punjab, Dept Geol, Bathinda 151401, Punjab, India.",jitendra.kumar@cup.edu.in,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2024,24.0,1,,,,,449,463,,10.1007/s11368-023-03671-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-023-03671-z,,OCT 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001091152400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lower pH and high total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity and NO3- values in the Gagribal basin and in some patches of other basins reflect anthropogenic inputs in the form of sewage from surrounding population, houseboats, hotels, etc. The Dal Lake is characterized by high chemical index of alteration (CIA: 87-95), reflecting extreme weathering of the catchment area. Relative to the average carbonates, the lakebed sediments are enriched in Al, Ti, Zn, Cu and Co and depleted in Ni and Mn. Compared to the post-Archean Shale the sediments have higher Al, Zn and Cu contents and lower Ni and Co. There are distinct positive anomalies of Al, Mn, Zn and Cu and negative anomalies of Ni and Pb with respect to the upper continental crust.

Based on a comprehensive chemical andstable isotope (N-15) analysis of nitrogen compounds andsatellite observations, we provide unequivocal evidence that wildfireemissions in South Asia can come across the Himalayas and threatenthe HTP's ecosystem. Such wildfire episodes, mostly occurringin spring (March-April), not only substantially enhanced theaerosol nitrogen concentration but also altered its composition (i.e.,rendering it more bioavailable). We estimated a nitrogen depositionflux at QOMS of similar to 10 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), which is approximately twice the lower value of the critical loadrange reported for the Alpine ecosystem. Such adverse impact is particularlyconcerning, given the anticipated increase of wildfire activitiesin the future under climate change.","[Bhattarai, Hemraj; Wu, Guangming; Gao, Shaopeng; Wan, Xin; Pei, Qiaomin; Cong, Zhiyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resources, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Bhattarai, Hemraj] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Earth Syst Sci Programme, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Bhattarai, Hemraj] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Grad Div Earth & Atmospher Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Xiaoyan; Zhu, Hongxia] China Natl Environm Monitoring Ctr, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan-Lin] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Yale NUIST Ctr Atmospher Environm, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Widory, David] Geotop Univ Quebec, Montreal, PQ H2X 3Y7, Canada; [Widory, David] Montreal UQAM, Montreal, PQ H2X 3Y7, Canada; [Ram, Kirpa] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, India; [Chen, Xintong; Kang, Shichang] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Pan, Yuepeng] Chinese Acad Sci, LAPC, Inst Atmospher Phys, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Cong, Zhiyuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China",,"Cong, ZY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Resources, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Cong, ZY (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China.",zhiyuancong@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 13,2023,57.0,25,,,,,9243,9251,,10.1021/acs.est.3c01541,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c01541,,JUN 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001008558600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

P.",,,Surface area change detection of snow/ice cover over Zemu Glacier of Sikkim Himalaya,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"This study assessed the snow/ice surface area changes over the Zemu Glacier in the Eastern Himalayas. Zemu is considered to be the largest glacier in the Eastern Himalayas located in the Sikkim State of India. Change detection in the snow/ice surface areal extent of the Zemu Glacier was delineated from the year 1945 using US Army Map Service-Topographical Sheets and Landsat imageries available from 1987 to 2020. The results obtained solely focus on surface-change delineation using remote sensing satellite data and GIS software. Landsat imagery of the years 1987, 1997, 2009, 2018, and 2020 was used for snow and ice pixel extraction. Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), Snow Cover Index (S3), and new band ratio index were used to extract the pure snow and ice pixels, fresh snow, and debris-covered snow/ice area and pixels mixed with shadow to demarcate the surface area changes. Manual delineation was required and undertaken for better results. A slope raster image was generated from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) data to delineate the slope and hill shade. The results illustrate that the snow/ice surface covering the glacier had an area of 113.5 km(2) in the year 1945 which was reduced to 78.31 km(2) in the year 2020 indicating a total snow/ice surface area loss of 31% in 75 years. A loss of 11.45% was observed from 1945 to 1987 in the areal extent, while from 1987 to 2009, a decadal loss of approximately 7% was observed. The surface area loss of 8.46% from 2009 to 2018 led to infer the maximum loss of snow and ice over the glacier body at a rate of 0.94% per year. Between the years 2018 and 2020, the glacier lost 1.08% of its surface area. The Accumulation Area Ratio (AAR) considering the accumulation and ablation areas of the glacier indicated a gradual decline of the accumulation zone in the recent years. Global Land Ice Measurement from Space (GLIMS) program data with RGI version 6.0 was used as a reference to demarcate the areal extent of Zemu Glacier. The study gained above 80% of overall accuracy by generating a confusion matrix in ArcMap. The analysis of this seasonal snow/ice cover showed that there has been a drastic decline in the surface snow/ice cover area over the Zemu Glacier over the years 1987 to 2020 and NDSI; S3 analysis provided improved results to delineate snow/ice cover area over such steep terrain topography of Sikkim Himalaya.","[Mukherjee, Nikita Roy; Krishna, A.

The flow of these services depends on land use and land cover (LULC) changes, ecological factors such as types, pattern and composition of vegetation, as well as anthropogenic factors. ES assessment helps to deal with the complexity of the interrelationships among LULC, ES supply and societal benefits. Using the case of the Phewa watershed, Nepal, this paper presents a quantitative and qualitative assessment of priority ES to understand how the supply of ES and their societal benefits have changed over the past 40 years. LULC changes were analysed using satellite images, ecosystem services were assessed using biophysical data and expressed spatially using ArcGIS. Results reveal a substantial reversal of land degradation and indicate forest recovery over the last 40 years. Dense forests increased by 1471 ha (88%) while sparse forests, grasslands and agricultural lands declined by 26%, 77% and 15%, respectively. These significant changes in LULC had a positive impact on ES due to the conversion of agricultural/grasslands and degraded forests to dense forests. ES varied significantly across the watershed. Dense forests provided relatively higher sediment retention (soil erosion rate decreased from > 30 ton ha(1) yr(1) to < 15 ton ha(-1) yr(-1)), carbon stocks (from < 50 m(3) ha(-1) to > 100 m(3) ha(-1)), habitat provision, and raw materials than other types of land cover, but reduced the water discharge. Increased aesthetic value from the restored landscape provides higher opportunities for recreation and ecotourism. Analysis of benefit-relevant indicators revealed that the perceived societal benefits from most of the ES were significantly lower than the potential supply of ES in the watershed.","[Paudyal, Kiran; Keenan, Rodney J.] Univ Melbourne, Fac Sci, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia; [Paudyal, Kiran] Forest Act, Patan, Nepal; [Baral, Himlal] Ctr Int Forestry Res, Jalan CIFOR, Bogor 16115, Barat, Indonesia; [Bhandari, Santosh P.] Indufor Asia Pacific, 55 Shortland St, Auckland, New Zealand; [Bhandari, Anil] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, CDR, Vienna, Austria",,"Paudyal, K (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Sci, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Carlton, Vic 3010, Australia.",kiran.paudyal@gmail.com; H.Baral@cgiar.org; santosh.bhandari@indufor-ap.com; rkeenan@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,,57.0,62.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2019,36.0,,,,,,,,100895,10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.100895,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2019.100895,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000462358400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has some significant impacts on the ecosystem and human life. GIS-based, DSAS and CA-Markov models are efficient techniques to measure historical and predictive changes following channel shifting and LULC change. In this study, forty-eight years (1972-2020) of earth observatory data were taken to demarcate and detect the channel bank position and LULC change along the Kaljani River, located at the eastern Himalayan foothill. During 1998-2008, a very high rate of erosion has been taken place on both the bankline, which are about -4.48 m/y (left bank) and -3.48 m/y (right bank), respectively. The overall result of the predicted bankline represents that the bulky expansion will occur along the left bank, and sediment accretion will take place at the right bank. Among the three zones, both banks of zone 'A' (lower part of the river) are worst affected in the past and present and will follow the same trends in future. The LULC change of all six classes from 1972 to 1998 is very high compared with the changes between 1998 and 2020. Moreover, long profile, hypsometric curve value, and the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) value have a significant help in understanding and identifying consequences reasons. The accuracy level is validated by the actual bankline positions (2020) with predicted bankline (2020) and actual LULC (2020) to predicted LULC (2020) empirically with RMSE and statistical test. The accuracy level of this study is conducted with the Kappa statistics for LULC map of 2020, and the result is 87.57%, and bankline shifting RMSE varies from 0.007 to 0.176. Therefore, the prediction output serves as the spatial guidelines for monitoring future trends of channel shift and land use planning management.","[Hasanuzzaman, Md; Shit, Pravat Kumar] Raja NL Khan Womens Coll Autonomous, Dept Geog, Midnapore 721102, W Bengal, India; [Gayen, Amiya; Haque, Sk Mafizul] Univ Calcutta, Dept Geog, Kolkata, India",,"Shit, PK (corresponding author), Raja NL Khan Womens Coll Autonomous, Dept Geog, Midnapore 721102, W Bengal, India.",hasan20geo@gmail.com; mr.amiyagayen@gmail.com; mafi_haque@yahoo.co.in; pravatgeo2007@gmail.com,,,,,,,,10.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2022,36.0,2,,,,,563,582,,10.1007/s00477-021-02147-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-021-02147-1,,JAN 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000741283200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the factors affecting the large-scale accumulation of Cambrian shale gas are unknown. In this paper, taking the Cambrian shale in Guizhou and its periphery as an example, the sedimentary system, structural characteristics, trap types and favorable hydrocarbon accumulation areas of shale have been studied in detail, based on a large number of field outcrops, cores, drilling, seismic tests and scanning electron microscope data. The research results show that the Cambrian strata can be divided into east and west regions. The bottom of the Lower Cambrian is a rhythmic interbedded black carbonaceous mudstone and siliceous rock with phosphorus nodules; the upper part develops a band of dark gray and gray-green mudstone intercalated with siltstone. The Middle-Upper Cambrian is a large set of carbonate platform deposits. Since the late Mesoproterozoic, the study area has experienced Caledonian Movement, Indosinian-Himalayan Movement, and Yanshan-Himalayan Movement. A large number of folds and faults in the study area were formed in the Indosinian period, which was finalized in the Yanshan period and was further transformed in the Himalayan period. Linear folds are a common structural style in this area, and they are generally in the NNE direction; and the study area develops multiple strike fault systems, which are mainly north-east and north-north-trending faults. Combining with the study of sedimentation, structure and trap, the favorable areas of Cambrian shale in the study area were predicted.

This study examines the drivers of change experienced by transhumant herders in Bajhang, western Nepal, in order to understand future implications for transhumant pastoralism in the region. Here, animals are raised to transport goods to remote villages and to earn supplemental income through the sale of milk, meat, and livestock. The study found that herders are experiencing multiple drivers of changes-including socioeconomic, political, institutional, ecological, and climatic-which have both positive and negative implications for their livelihoods. Herders have responded to these changes by altering their transhumance routes and by reducing the variety and numbers of animals raised. The increasing market demand for meat from freely grazed animals and limited road access are current factors contributing to the perpetuation of transhumant herding in Bajhang. Meanwhile, the institutional mechanisms provisioned in the National Rangeland Policy are neither functional in the study area nor able to resolve issues of the herders. The study recommends developing an incentive-based mechanism involving herders and other stakeholders to address the challenges faced by herders.","[Pasakhala, Binaya; Ghate, Rucha; Phuntsho, Karma; Gurung, Janita; Gurung, Kamala; Thapa, Sunil] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Gentle, Popular] Charles Sturt Univ, Inst Land Water & Soc, POB 789, Albury, NSW 2640, Australia; [Shrestha, Ashok] Minist Forests & Environm, POB 3987, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Pasakhala, B (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.",binaya.pasakhala@icimod.org,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,41.0,4,,,,,R8,R15,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-20-00073.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-20-00073.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000753145500015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Don) occurs in areas affected by landslides/landslips and is a nitrogen-fixing species; it quickly improves soil physical and chemical properties and facilitates the restoration of degraded forests. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of A. nepalensis forest chronosequence on the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations, N and P stocks, and stoichiometry in the soil, including microbial biomass C (MBC), microbial biomass N (MBN) and microbial biomass P (MBP), and in the plant components. Six naturally occurring forest stands were identified in a chronosequence of A. nepalensis (age 3-270 years old) forest stands, namely alder-early regenerating (AER), alder-late regenerating (ALR), alder young-mixed (AYM), alder mature-oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) mixed (AMOM), alder mature-rhododendron (Rhododendron arboreum) mixed (AMR), and alder old-oak (Q. leucotrichophora) mixed (AOOM) forests. The biomass of tree components was estimated using species-specific allometric equations developed by previous workers for the region. Soil total N and total P stocks of each species were determined by the N and P concentrations and bulk density. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to quantify the contribution of N and P pools to ecosystem nitrogen and phosphorus stocks. The results of this study revealed that the stoichiometry (C:N, N:P, and C:P ratios) of tree components (i.e., leaves, leaf litter, twig), soil and microbial biomass varied widely, and the presence of nitrogen-fixing A. nepalensis in different succession stages significantly improved the soil and microbial biomass stoichiometry. Total vegetation (tree, herbs, shrubs, and litter) biomass N stock ranged from 346.77 to 4662.06 kg N ha(-1), and soil N stock varied from 816.48 to 7334.24 kg N ha(-1). Total ecosystem N and P stocks ranged from 1163.26 to 11,996.31 kg N ha(-1) and 76.10 to 799.28 kg P ha(-1), respectively, and positively increased with A. nepalensis total biomass. The soil P stock accounted for 63.49% to 74.80% of the total P stocks of the forest ecosystems. Overall, our findings suggest that A. nepalensis forest chronosequence enhanced the N and P stocks, and introducing this species in degraded forests appears to be an option for enhancing forest conservation and rehabilitation actions in the central Himalaya.","[Joshi, Rajendra Kumar; Garkoti, Satish Chandra] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi, India; [Garkoti, Satish Chandra] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India",,"Garkoti, SC (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India.",sgarkoti@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 30,2023,34.0,12,,,,,3769,3789,,10.1002/ldr.4719,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4719,,APR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000974454200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Herein, variability of rainfall in Lakhimpur district situated in NBPZ was studied. A significant decreasing trend of annual and seasonal rainfall was observed. Significant decrease in monsoon rainfall and increase in monthly rainfall variability clearly explains the recent rainfall fluctuations with increasing frequency of intermittent dry spells and flash floods. A participatory evaluation trial was conducted in Chamua village of Lakhimpur district having different land situations to identify climate resilient technologies to cope with seasonal drought in sali rice. High-yielding short-duration varieties, viz., Dishang, Luit, Lachit and Kolong, and medium-duration varieties, viz., Basundhara, Mohan, Mulagabhoru and TTB-404 performed consistently better than the long-duration HYV or the traditional varieties under upland and medium land situations, respectively. Though the effect of dry spells on long-duration varieties cultivated on low lands was least, yield of these varieties reduced up to 43.07% when sowing was delayed beyond 23rd of June. Performance of the delayed sown varieties was further declined, when exposed to dry spells at later growth stages.

Based on high-resolution satellite images and unpiloted aerial vehicle surveys, this study investigated the dynamic changes of Zhuxi Glacier, a thick debris-covered glacier in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. Our result shows that the whole glacier can be divided into the active regime and stagnant regime along the elevation of 3400 m a.s.l. The mean surface velocity of the active regime was 13.1 m yr(-1), which was five times higher than that of the stagnant regime. The surface-lowing rate of this debris-covered glacier reaches more than 1 m yr(-1) and displays an accelerating trend. The majority of ice loss concentrates around ice cliffs and supraglacial ponds, the ablation hotspots. These hotspots can be roughly classified into three types, including persistent, expanding, and shrinking patterns, at different dynamic regimes on the Zhuxi Glacier. With the evolution of these hotpots and glacier dynamic changes, the supraglacial ponds showed significant change, with the total number fluctuating from 15 to 38 and the total area increasing from 1128 m(2) to 95790 m(2) during the past decade. The recent exponential expansion of the proglacial lake and the significant downwasting of stagnant ice inside the dammed terminus moraine possibly trigger the glacial lake outburst flood and thus threaten the security of livelihoods and infrastructure downstream.","[He, Zhen; Yang, Wei; Wang, Yongjie; Zhao, Chuanxi; Ren, Shaoting; Li, Chenhui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [He, Zhen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yongjie] South East Tibetan Plateau Stn Integrated Observat, Lulang 860119, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chuanxi] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Earth & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",,"Yang, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yangww@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2023,15.0,2,,,,,,,357,10.3390/rs15020357,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15020357,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000916427100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For this, one meteorological observatory and two gauging sites have been established at Dwali (confluence point), and water samples have been collected twice in a day for high flow period (July to September) and daily for lean period (May, June and October). An area-velocity method and stage-discharge relationship has been established to convert water level into discharge (m(3) s(-1)). For estimating SSC (mg/l), collected water samples have been filtered, dried, analysed and confirmed with an automatic suspended solid indicator. Further, SSL, sediment yield and erosion rates have been computed using SSC data. The results reveal that mean annual discharge in PGB (35.06 m(3) s(-1)) has been found approximately 1.7 times higher than KGB (20.47 m(3) s(-1)). The average SSC and SSL in PGB have been observed about 396.07 mg/l and 1928.34 tonnes, and in KGB, it is about 359.67 mg/l and 1040.26 tonnes, respectively. The SSC and SSL have followed the pattern of discharge. A significant correlation of SSC and SSL has been found with discharge in both the glacierized basins (p < 0.01). Interestingly, average annual sediment yield in PGB (3196.53 t/km(2)/yr) and KGB (3087.23 t/km(2)/yr) have been found almost identical. Likewise, the erosion rates in PGB and KGB have been witnessed about 1.18 and 1.14 mm/yr, respectively. Sediment yield and erosion rates in PGB and KGB have been found in correspondence with other basins of Central Himalaya.

J,"Sharma, N; Kumar, S",,,,"Sharma, Niharika; Kumar, Sanjeev",,,Nitrogen transformation rates in the Himalayan soils at different temperature and elevation conditions,JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Purpose Vast expanses of climatically sensitive ecosystems, such as tropical montane, remain unstudied in terms of factors controlling nitrogen (N) availability and in turn productivity. Temperature and elevation are two important, yet understudied, factors which decide the fate of N in montane ecosystems. Therefore, the present study aimed to quantify and understand changes in rates of N transformation processes in tropical montane soils of the Himalayas under different temperature-elevation conditions. Materials and methods The(15)N isotope dilution technique was employed to quantify the rates of gross N transformations in soils collected at two depth intervals (0-20 cm and 20-40 cm) from five elevations (3000 m, 2500 m, 2000 m, 1500 m, and 1000 m above sea level) of the Garhwal Himalayas. The rates were measured at low (10 degrees C) and high temperature (23 degrees C) conditions to decipher the effect of temperature change on N cycling in montane soils. Results and discussion The results indicated a significant increase in gross N mineralization rates under the high temperature condition compared to the low. Interestingly, gross nitrification rates remained unaffected of temperature change. Increase in gross N mineralization at high temperature condition was accompanied with increased ammonium (NH4+) consumption, which was largely in the form of NH(4)(+)immobilization. In general, gross N transformation rates in the top soils showed higher response to change in temperature and elevation conditions than the bottom soils. Conclusion Increase in rates of N mineralization and other soil N cycling processes at higher temperature suggests potential acceleration in N turnover due to warming in the Himalayan soils. Increased NH(4)(+)immobilization and poor sensitivity of nitrification to temperature are likely to increase soil N conservation at higher temperature. The inconsistent variation in N transformation rates with elevation suggested higher control of edaphic factors on soil N cycling at a particular elevation.","[Sharma, Niharika; Kumar, Sanjeev] Geosci Div, Phys Res Lab, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India",,"Kumar, S (corresponding author), Geosci Div, Phys Res Lab, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India.",sanjeev@prl.res.in,,,,,,,,13.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2021,21.0,1,,,,,13,26,,10.1007/s11368-020-02722-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-020-02722-z,,AUG 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000554845200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They have remained largely unstudied because of their remoteness and inaccessibility. It is imperative to have quantitative studies of these areas to allow the long-term monitoring of flora in these fragile ecosystems. During the present study, nutrient analysis and species diversity of some alpine grasslands were investigated. Electroconductivity (EC) of the soils ranged between 0.12 and 0.33 (dSm(-1)). With an increase in altitude and precipitation and a decrease in temperature, soil pH and available macro-nutrients (OC, N, P, K) show a considerable decrease. Sixty-six plant species belonging to twenty-nine families and fifty-one genera were reported with members predominantly from the Asteraceae, Rosaceae and Plantaginaceae families. Seven species were common to all study areas and Renyi diversity profiles showed that Kongwattan was the most diverse followed by Poshpathri and Yousmarg. The results of the Sorensen beta diversity index showed a relatively lower dissimilarity index among the three studied alpine sites. In the majority of the growth forms, growth initiation was recorded in April, whereas senescence occurred in September. The highest bloom was seen in June-July. The plant species exhibited a greater variability in their phenophases under different environmental conditions and altitudinal gradients. Plants were more vigorous at lower altitudes and showed rapid response to the prevailing conditions. Stoloniferous forbs and tussock forming graminoids such as Sibbaldia cuneata, Trifolium repens, Plantago major, Trifolium pratense, Poa compressa, Poa angustifolia, and Plantago lanceolata showed a greater importance value index (IVI). The sedentary system of livestock rearing at Yousmarg resulted in the decreased density of the palatable species. This study allowed us to conclude that direct knowledge of soil nutrient composition and species diversity in alpine ecosystems can enhance conservation and ensure better management practices over a period of time.","[Wani, Ishfaq Ahmad; Verma, Susheel] Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah Univ, Dept Bot, Rajouri 185234, India; [Gupta, Renu] Sher Kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol, Fac Agr, Div Soil Sci & Agr Chem, Jammu 180009, India; [Ganaie, Masood Majaz] Govt Degree Coll Tral, Dept Bot, Pulwama 192123, India; [Nigam, Gaurav] Bundelkhand Univ, Dept Bot, Jhansi 284128, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shafik, Hesham M.] Univ Pannonia, Hungarian Acad Sci, Limnoecol Res Grp, Gyetum U 10m, H-8200 Veszprem, Hungary; [Al-Misned, Fahad A.] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Zool, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",,"Verma, S (corresponding author), Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah Univ, Dept Bot, Rajouri 185234, India.",waniishfaq680@gmail.com; eremurus@rediffmail.com; renugupta2781975@gmail.com; masoodmg@gmail.com; gauravjnigam@rediffmail.com; heshamshafik@yahoo.co.uk; helserehy@ksu.edu.sa,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,14.0,2,,,,,,,887,10.3390/su14020887,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14020887,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000757267600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

One thousand three hundred and seventy five kills were documented, with leopards killing significantly more livestock (70% of all kills), than tigers (19%), bears (8%) and snow leopards (2%). About 50% of livestock killing were of cattle, and about 33% were of horses, with tigers, leopards and snow leopards killing a significantly greater proportion of horses than predicted from availability. Examination of cattle kills showed that leopards killed a significantly greater proportion of smaller prey (e.g., calves), whereas tigers killed a significantly greater proportion of larger prey (e.g., bulls). Overall, livestock predation was greatest in summer and autumn which corresponded with a peak in cropping agriculture; livestock are turned out to pasture and forest during the cropping season, and subsequently, are less well guarded than at other times. Across Bhutan, high horse density and low cattle and yak density were associated with high rates of livestock attack, but no relationship was found with forest cover or human population density. Several northern districts were identified as 'predation hotspots', where proportions of livestock lost to predation were considerable, and the ratio of reported kills to relative abundance of livestock was high. Implications of our findings for mitigating livestock losses and for conserving large carnivores in Bhutan are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, aerosols emitted from these burning activities significantly modulate the Earth's radiation budget. In present study, we investigated the anomalous forest fire events and their impact on atmospheric radiation budget and glaciated snow cover over the Himalayan region. We used multiple dataset derived from satellites [Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO)] and reanalysis models [Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS), Second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application (MERRA-2) and ERA-interim] to evaluate the effect of biomass burning aerosols on radiation budget. April 2016 is associated with anomalous fire activities over lower Himalayan region in the last fourteen years (2003-2016). The model estimated organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC) emission reaches up to similar to 3 x 10(4) and similar to 2 x 10(3) mu g/m(2)/day, respectively during the biomass burning period of April 2016. The meteorological data analysis accompanied with CALIOP aerosol vertical profile shows that these carbonaceous aerosols could reach up to similar to 5-7 km altitude and could be transported towards glaciated region of upper Himalayas. The large amount of BC/OC from biomass burning significantly modulates the atmospheric radiation budget. The estimated columnar heating rate shows that these carbonaceous aerosols could heat up the atmosphere by similar to 0.04-0.06 K/day in April-2016 with respect to non-burning period (2015). The glaciated snow cover fractions are found to be decreasing by similar to 5-20% in 2016 as compared to long term mean (2003-2016). The combined analyses of various climatic factors, fires and associated BC emissions show that the observed snow cover decrease could be results of increased surface/atmospheric temperature due to combined effect of large scale climatic changes and BC absorption. Our results suggest that biomass burning can have significant effects on the Himalayan region, particularly in view of its importance in hydrological cycle and ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, studies have reported significant variations in the Himalayan snow cover area, which may impact the livelihood of a large portion of the global population. Therefore, in this study, efforts were made to estimate the association between key climate stressors (CSs), i.e., temperature and precipitation, topography, and temporal variability of snow cover area (SCA) in the Parvati River basin (PRB) of the Indian western Himalayas. In this regard, the PRB has been classified into different elevation zones, i.e., zone I to zone V, ranging from 1100 to 6200 amsl. The databases such as MODIS, MEERA-2, and ASTER DEM V2 have been used to estimate the changes in the SCA and the CSs with changes in elevation and seasons. The linear regression analysis of the dataset from 2001 to 2017 revealed a significant association and increasing trend in the SCA of zone III. However, a significant association could not be established between the elevation and the SCA for the rest of the zones. A zonal seasonal trend investigation of the SCA observed an increasing trend in zones IV and V during the summer season due to a momentous rise in snowfall and a decline in temperature. The SCA has shown a significant declining trend only during the monsoon season in zones IV and V, which is due to a strong negative relationship between the SCA and the temperature of the region. These results demonstrate the amount of SCA in zones of high elevation of the PRB has been declining at an alarming rate, which could negatively influence glaciers' retreat in the near future. Hence, it can be estimated that the outcomes of the study will act as a base for future studies, regional policy formulation, and climate modelling that can further prevent future drastic or extreme events.","[Kumar, Deepak] Kurukshetra Univ, Dept Geog, IIHS, Kurukshetra 136119, India; [Thind, Parteek Singh] Georgian Coll, Environm Technol Programs, Barrie, ON, Canada; [Sharma, Tejpal] Dyal Singh Coll, Dept Geog, Karnal 132001, India",,"Kumar, D (corresponding author), Kurukshetra Univ, Dept Geog, IIHS, Kurukshetra 136119, India.",deepak.geo.earth@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2024,31.0,1,,,,,857,870,,10.1007/s11356-023-31056-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-023-31056-9,,NOV 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001122280600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We explored habitat preference and beta-diversity of macroinvertebrates at 59 sampling sites from 18 watersheds of the Jhelum River Basin in Kashmir Himalaya. Macroinvertebrates were collected, sorted, identified, and enumerated from four habitat types (Run, Riffle, Glide, and Pool) from 59 sites during the 8 seasons from Summer 2017 to Spring 2019. Stream habitats differed significantly based on the number of taxa (species richness) and density (ind./m(2)) across the seasons. beta-diversity assessment revealed that the Riffle, Glide, Run, and Pool differed in dispersion using the abundance/count data across the seasons with a more pronounced difference during autumn and winter seasons. Habitats displayed homogeneity among group dispersion (i.e., composition varies similarly) while having different compositions. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and multivariate dispersion showed greater similarity between Run-Pool and Riffle-Glide in terms of macroinvertebrate composition. Indicator species analysis based on relative abundance (%) revealed different habitat preferences of macroinvertebrate taxa. Simper analysis identified 18 taxa that contributed greatest to the dissimilarity between habitats for each season. Biomonitoring assessment categorized Jhelum River Basin into three water class categories: upstream reaches (60%) fall under Class A, midstream reaches (25%) belong to Class B, and downstream reaches fall under Class C and D (15%) categories, respectively. Our findings reinforce the relevance of macroinvertebrate communities as bioindicators for guiding the policy intervention for effective monitoring and appropriate management strategies of different watersheds in the Jhelum River Basin.","[Sabha, I; Islam, S.

Here, we compile data on satellite observation of vegetation greenness and spring onset date, satellite-based soil moisture, passive microwave snow water equivalent (SWE) and climate data to show that winter SWE can significantly influence vegetation greenness during the early growing season (the period between spring onset date and peak photosynthesis timing) over nearly one-fifth of the land surface in the region north of 30 degrees, but the magnitude and sign of correlation exhibits large spatial heterogeneity. We then apply an assembled path model to disentangle the two main processes (via changing early growing-season soil moisture, and via changing the growth period) in controlling the impact of winter SWE on vegetation greenness, and suggest that the moisture and growth period effect, to a larger extent, result in positive and negative snow-productivity associations, respectively. The magnitude and sign of snow-productivity association is then dependent upon the relative dominance of these two processes, with the moisture effect and positive association predominating in Central, western North America and Greater Himalaya, and the growth period effect and negative association in Central Europe. We also indicate that current state-of-the-art models in general reproduce satellite-based snow-productivity relationship in the region north of 30 degrees, and do a relatively better job of capturing the moisture effect than the growth period effect. Our results therefore work towards an improved understanding of winter snow impact on vegetation greenness in northern ecosystems, and provide a mechanistic basis for more realistic terrestrial carbon cycle models that consider the impacts of winter snow processes.","[Wang, Xiaoyi; Wang, Tao; Guo, Hui; Liu, Dan; Zhao, Yutong; Zhang, Taotao; Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol & Biodivers, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Tao; Piao, Shilong] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qiang; Piao, Shilong] Peking Univ, Sino French Inst Earth Syst Sci, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Wang, T (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",twang@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,84.0,92.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2018,24.0,4,,,,,1651,1662,,10.1111/gcb.13930,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.13930,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000426504400018,View Full Record in Web of Science

The knowledge gap limits our ability to design well-founded strategies and impedes the prospects of addressing myriad conservation challenges. It is therefore important to assess trends and biases in biodiversity and conservation literature to monitor progress and make corrective actions where needed. Nepal is considered among the most biodiverse regions globally, yet little is known about the progress of biodiversity and conservation science. Here we reviewed 1098 articles published over the last fifty-six years (1964-2019) and provide a snapshot of research patterns, trends and gaps in terms research lens, physiography, ecosystem, protected area, taxonomy, ecological focus, funding, research recommendation, and research authorship and collaboration. The results of our study showed a monotonic trend of article publication until 1990, which increased significantly after 1999. There is a growing trend in the number of publications with socio-economic and multidisciplinary lens. Research publications are highly biased in favour of few taxonomic groups, mainly gymnosperms and mammals, with a preponderance of certain species, while other classes of both the plant and animal kingdoms were less studied. There was disproportionately low focus on certain physiographic regions (e.g., high Himalaya, Siwalik), ecosystem types (e.g., wetlands) and non-protected areas. Articles with an ecological focus were mainly exploratory-e.g., describing general distributions-whereas specialized ecological/evolutionary research (e.g., grazing, competition, physiology), except for genetics and climate change, were rare. More than half of the articles were authored only by foreign-based researchers, who contributed up to 89% of published articles, and consistently maintained dominance as corresponding and lead authors. There is a need to realign research efforts and support home-grown researchers with training, funding and institution-building. This requires a concerted commitment by the Government of Nepal, conservation organizations, researchers and academic institutions. There remains a great need for more empirical science to inform decision-making and consequently achieve ambitious national conservation targets.","[Paudel, Prakash Kumar; Baniya, Shishila; Sharma, Shyam; Bhandari, Simrik; Pokharel, Manoj] Kathmandu Inst Appl Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, POB 23002, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Paudel, PK (corresponding author), Kathmandu Inst Appl Sci, Ctr Conservat Biol, POB 23002, Kathmandu, Nepal.",pk.paudel@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2023,32.0,8-9,,,,,2611,2636,,10.1007/s10531-023-02626-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-023-02626-7,,MAY 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000997054900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These water resources are under serious threat due to climate change, with the potential to alter the economic stability of 237 million people living in the Indus River Basin alone. In the present study, we used new stable water isotope data set to identify and estimate the different sources of streamflow and their controlling factors in the Upper Indus River Basin (UIRB), India. The data set presented wide spatial and temporal variability without the distinct isotopic signature of various sources of river flow. However, variable but distinct signatures of sources of river/stream flow exist at the sub-basin or catchment scale. These variabilities are ascribed to changing physiographical, meteorological, and local climatic conditions. Further, the distinct microclimatic conditions including altitudinal variability, aspect slope, etc. govern the spatio-temporal variability of sources and streamflow, hence different lapse rates at sub-basin/catchment scale. The study suggested that the contribution of snowmelt and glacier melt to river flow varies spatially and temporally. The Bayesian mixing model results suggested that snowmelt contribution is higher in Indus (63 +/- 1.2%) and Shyok (58 +/- 1.7%) while as, glacier melt contribution is higher in Nubra 64 +/- 2.3% and Suru 60 +/- 2.7% sub-basins/catchments. The groundwater contribution (baseflow) sustains and regulates the flow in rivers/streams during winter and spring, which is very vital for the local water supply. The study suggests that the spatially diverse rugged topography and microclimate in UIRB dominantly control the differential contribution from various sources of river flow. The warming climate, which has resulted in a decrease in solid precipitation, continuous glacier mass loss, early melting of snow cover, etc., would have an inconsistent impact on the perennial flow of rivers with the potential to alter the economic and political stability in the region.","[Lone, Suhail A.; Jeelani, Ghulam] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, India; [Padhya, Virendra; Deshpande, R.

The impacts of this climate warming in the geologically fragile Himalayas has started to show its effects on shifting precipitation patterns, increasing temperatures, glaciers meltdown, species richness patterns and overall unpredictable microclimatic conditions. For measuring such impacts of current climate warming in Himalayan ecosystems, need of ecological substitutes has been stressed on by different United Nation conventions. Lichens in contrast to vascular flora have long been proved to act as cost effective global indicators for measuring ecosystems responses to environmental climate. The variations in microclimatic attributes and their effects on photosynthetic efficiency and distribution were studied in geologically fragile ecosystem of Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Garhwal Himalayas. Total 217 species of lichens comprising 80 genera and 35 families were found along different elevations. Among the different habitat groups, corticolous lichens showed their dominance (123 species) followed by saxicolous (65 species) and terricolous (29 species) lichens. Corticolous forms were dominated by crustose while saxicolous and terricolous were mostly fruticose growth forms. Mostly large number of species showed a narrow distribution with maximum species richness observed in mid elevation zones (1950-2200m) followed by a gradual decline towards higher elevations. Phaeophyscia hispidula, Parmotrema reticulatum and Flavoparmelia caperata showed wider ecological amplitude. Out of these species, P. hispidula and F. caperata were further subjected to chlorophyll fluorescence measurements with a pulse amplified modulated fluorometer to access photosynthetic quenching efficiencies. Maximum electron transport rates (ETR; 96 +/- 5.76mole(-) m(-2)s(-1)) were observed in Phaeophyscia hispidula (1550m) while F. caperata showed nearly 21% lower ETR. Photochemical quenching (qP; 0.5 +/- 0.01) was maximum at 1550m elevation in F. caperata while P. hispidula showed maximum qP values at 2200m elevation, showing it's higher tolerances towards extreme light stresses. F. caperata showed higher (0.102 +/- 0.003) non photochemical quenching (NPQ) in comparison to P. hispidula (0.062 +/- 0.001) at extreme elevations of 3508m. P. hispidula overall showed more toxitolerant nature towards abiotic stresses as compared to F. caperata. Higher photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 1600-2350 mu molm(-2)s(-1)), thallus hydration levels and extreme variations in air temperature (5.75-31.65 degrees C), ambient humidity along elevations were imperative in controlling species richness, distribution and photosynthetic quenching of lichen flora in the region.","[Sahu, Nayan; Singh, Pragya] Indira Gandhi Natl Tribal Univ, Dept Bot, Amarkantak, MP, India; [Sahu, Nayan; Singh, Shiv Naresh; Mishra, Shruti; Karakoti, Neha; Bajpai, Rajesh; Behera, Soumit K.; Nayaka, Sanjeeva; Upreti, D.

Here, we combine remotely sensed data and field observations to map snowfall distribution and snow depths during the recent snowfall events in November 2018 and November 2019. Besides, we used ERA-5 reanalysis climate datasets to investigate the causes of these erratic snowfall events, pointing to an early arrival of Western Disturbances (WD) to the area. Analysis of these untimely snowfall episodes indicates that snow depths varied from 5-122 cm and 31-152 cm during the 2018 and 2019 snowfall events, respectively. In turn, satellite data analysis reveals that the apple orchards cover roughly 9.8% (1329 km(2)) of the entire surface of Kashmir Valley, out of which 32.6% were mildly to severely damaged by snow. The areas in South Kashmir suffered the most from the untimely snowfall with an area affected estimated to similar to 264 km(2), followed by North Kashmir (similar to 151 km(2)) and Central Kashmir (18 km(2)). The snowfall caused substantial harvest losses in orchards ranging from 4-50% with an average of similar to 35%. The geopotential analysis from the ERA-5 dataset provides insights into the synoptic weather patterns leading to the snowfall events and point to a trough in the high-troposphere (200 mb), along with a col at lower levels (850 mb) over the Kashmir Valley from November 2-5, 2018. The lower levels (850 mb) experienced intense cyclonic circulation which favored advection of moisture from the Arabian Sea during the November 6-7, 2019, snowfall event. The large economic losses related to early arrival of WD led to a virtual grounding of the horticultural sector in 2018 and 2019. Therefore, more baseline research is critically needed along with a comprehensive evaluation of the suitability of horticulture as an economically viable sector that is being promoted over the Kashmir region, also under climate change.","[Rashid, Irfan; Majeed, Ulfat; Aneaus, Sheikh; Najar, Nadeem Ahmad; Bhat, Imtiyaz Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Geoinformat, Hazratbal Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Canovas, Juan Antonio Ballesteros; Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Climat Change & Climate Impacts, Blvd Carl Vogt 66, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Canovas, Juan Antonio Ballesteros; Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Inst Environm Sci, Dendrolabch, Blvd Carl Vogt 66, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Stoffel, Markus] Univ Geneva, Dept FA Forel Environm & Aquat Sci, Blvd Carl Vogt 66, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Lotus, Sonam] Indian Meteorol Dept, Srinagar 190008, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Rashid, I (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Geoinformat, Hazratbal Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",irfangis@kashmiruniversity.ac.in; ulfatmgis@gmail.com; sheikh.aneaus19@gmail.com; Juan.Ballesteros@unige.ch; Markus.Stoffel@unige.ch; nadeemgis17@gmail.com; bhatimtiyaz463@gmail.com; lotusladakh@gmail.com,,,,,,,,14.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2020,12.0,21,,,,,,,9206,10.3390/su12219206,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12219206,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000589257900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The globally accepted coherent approach of water quality indices (WQIs) and multivariate statistical models (principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA)) were applied on the dataset to evaluate the spatial-temporal variation and pollution source identification and apportionment. Twenty-two hydro-chemical parameters were analyzed by collecting the samples from 20 different vertically elevated monitoring locations for different seasons. The CA evaluation of data, grouped the monitoring locations into five clusters of varied water quality with human perturbations and geo-genic inputs. The PCA analysis of an extensive dataset indicated the seven significant principal components (PCs) explaining 93.0% of the total variance and finalized 8 water quality parameters out of preselected 22 to represent good aspects of the water quality. The seasonal variation in river water quality by the Canadian Council of Ministers for Environment Water Quality Index (CCMEWQI) showed the quality class at a marginal level in summer (62.16), monsoon (59.96), and post-monsoon (60.20) season, whereas in winters (71.18), water quality was in fair condition. The response of National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) classified the river water in medium quality class for summer, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter season, respectively.

Assessment of the annual soil erosion rate provides information on soil erosion risk zones indicating the areas with high, severe and low risks. Modelling and prediction of soil erosion has a long history of more than seven decades. It becomes imperative to be familiar with the quantum of studies conducted and methods employed across the world to assess vulnerability of ecosystems to soil erosion to plan strategies for their conservation. There are several methods based on various factors like land use, soil quality, topography etc. available to assess the susceptibility of a region to soil loss. With time the gap in understanding of such models and their use around the world has increased. Numerous models for assessing soil erosion exist but there is a lack of knowledge on spatial distribution of the methods being used. Academic papers related to assessment of soil erosion vulnerability published during the past three decades (1991-2019) were reviewed. Total 160 studies were reviewed to understand advances in the methods used to assess soil erosion vulnerability worldwide, identification of the most popular methods and proportion of studies conducted in the fragile region of Himalayas. The results show that 18 different methods have mainly been used to assess soil erosion risk in different regions. These methods include statistical, physical, process based and empirical models. The use of few physical methods like ANSWERS and SHE has decreased with time while that of physical and process methods like RUSLE, SWAT, WEPP and PESERA has increased with time. The review highlighted that various models being used worldwide are based on their suitability to the region. It also brings to attention that few models like PESERA, EUROSEM and WEPP are mostly being used concentrated in a particular region. Models like PESERA and EPM are mostly used in European region and may be encouraged to estimate soil erosion in Himalayan region. The review also highlights lack of studies with inclusion of water quality as an important parameter while assessing soil erosion vulnerability in the region. The review suggests that in case of lack of data, various statistical methods like PCA, CF, FUZZY etc. can be preferred for qualitative assessment over quantitative assessment. Considering availability of accurate input, researchers need to attempt more methods and perform comparative studies to attain accurate results for assessing soil erosion vulnerability leading to strategizing soil conservation in fragile regions.

The developing nations are worst affected as they are largely dependent on the local precipitation and soil moisture for their livelihood generations. The changing climate with extended summer, change in the rainfall pattern (intensity and duration) and variations of onset and departure of seasons are directly impacting the cultivation, status of natural vegetation, surface and sub-surface water, and other natural resources in a watershed area. Among the various efforts, watershed development approach, in which intervention is more site-specific in nature and can address the local requirements, is found to be more effective at micro levels. The vulnerability of climatic changes is mainly due to water stress, degradation of natural vegetations, degradation in the health and hygiene conditions, and poor information communication technology. The present article highlights these issues, impact of watershed development project in the Himalayan region and identifying the adaptation mechanism through watershed programs. A site specific action, research methods including primary and secondary data collections, GIS, remote sensing and statistical techniques were used. The study on the Jusho Bakro micro-watershed treated by TERI under the program DROP has been found to be effective in drawing possible adapting mechanism to withstand the changing climate and its severity on the natural resources and the livelihood of the community.","[Khan, M.

Ca2+, Mg2+, and NH4+ have neutralization factors as 2.51, 0.37, and 2.01, respectively, due to the neutralization of acidic species in RW. The non-sea salt (NSS) contribution to total Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+ indicates the major contribution from crustal origin, whereas the NSS contribution to the total Cl- and SO42- was from the anthropogenic source. The principle component analysis (PCA) indicates that the first factor (i.e., natural sources, mainly dust and sea salts) has only similar to 9% variance. In contrast, the second factor (i.e., fossil fuel and biomass burning) has similar to 17% variance, and the third factor has 27% variance may be due to soil, agricultural, and biomass burning origin.

People see the advantages and risks of these species through various value structures, which influences decisions on whether and where they can be managed. While many studies have focused on the ecological effects of invasive species, their impact on human livelihoods and well-being is less recognized. Understanding the effects (benefits and costs) of invasive species on livelihoods and human well-being, as well as people's perception, is important for guiding policy formulation and devising management strategies. Here we present a case study of Dal Lake -a freshwater urban lake of Kashmir Himalaya -providing various ecological, biological, and hydro-logical functions that offer economic, aesthetic, recreational, educational, and other values to the local populace. In the context of a gradually increasing attention on the impacts of Invasive Alien Plant species (IAPs) on this ecosystem, we conducted Focal Group Discussions (FGDs) to determine the perception of people living inside and around Dal Lake regarding two invasive species, namely, Nymphea mexicana and Hydrocharis dubia, and their capacity to provide ecosystem services (ES) and disservices (EDS). Following that, a discursive scenario assessment tool multi-criteria mapping (MCM) was used to involve stakeholders in ranking their priorities in two scenarios of the lake-'status quo' vs 'clean lake with limited weeds' in the Dal Lake social-ecological system. We found that their perception of the impact of invasive species varies with factors such as the location of invasive plants in the lake, and people's occupation, and household characteristics. Most participants perceive these species positively (i.e., agreeing that they create ecosystem services in the form of cattle feed), but some recognize their importance in providing ecosystem disservices. Their primary concern and priority were the sustenance of their livelihood in any scenario, and most respondents did not oppose the eradication of two IAPs if their livelihood is secure. We conclude that a more nuanced strategy to IAS management is required, one that combines both local livelihood demands and broader environmental and social considerations.","[Rashid, Irfan; Sheergojri, Ishfaq Ahmad; Ul Rehman, Ishfaq] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu And Kashm, India; [Rashid, Irfan] Univ Kashmir, Dept Geoinformat, Srinagar 190006, Jammu And Kashm, India",,"Rashid, I (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, Jammu And Kashm, India.",irfanrashid@uok.edu.in,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1,2022,309.0,,,,,,,,114674,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114674,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.114674,,FEB 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000782414700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Glacier mass balance (MB) studies have important implications for hazard management of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). However, Himalayan glacier MB results vary considerably among different studies with large uncertainties in satellite-based geodetic measurements, highlighting the necessity for further independent investigations and validation from multiple satellite platforms. Based on InSAR, photogrammetry, and laser altimetry techniques, we generate nine data sets of surface elevation differences (Dh) to study glacier geodetic MB in Rongbuk Catchment at the northern slope of Mt. Qomolangma. The data sets include five consecutive time periods over the last 48 years, i.e., 1974-2000, 2000-2006, 2006-2012, 2012-2015, and 2015-2021, and four overlapping periods of 1974-2012, 1974-2015, 2000-2015, and 1974-2021. The main results are summarized as follows. 1) Based on common reference DEM, Geodetic MB was -0.21 & PLUSMN; 0.11 m w.e.a(-1) in 1974-2000, -0.22 & PLUSMN; 0.05 m w.e. a(-1) in 1974-2015, and -0.20 & PLUSMN; 0.03 m w.e. a(-1) in 1974-2021. Geodetic MB presented negative twice since 2000 as measured by ordinary, consecutive short-term analysis, which was -0.41 & PLUSMN; 0.11 m w.e.a(-1) in 2000-2006, -0.50 & PLUSMN; 0.54 m w.e.a(-1) in 2006-2012, and -0.45 & PLUSMN; 0.11 m w.e.a(-1) in 2015-2021. 2) Data validation by in-situ stake-observations at 5350, 5450, and 5500 m a.s.l in 1959-1960 and the 2000s, our results demonstrated convincing altitude effects on glacier change. Between 5150 m a.s.l. and 5800 m a.s.l., Dh presented a more downwasting rate with increasing altitude. While above 5800 m a.s.l., Dh became less negative with increasing altitude, and glaciers presented thickening trend above 6200 m a.s.l. 3) With the difference of Dh by 10 m altitude intervals (DDh), we located a sharp surface lowering zone on the debris-covered glacier tongue at 5240 & PLUSMN; 20 m in the 1970s. We postulated that it could be the glacier terminus under debris cover, which moved upward by 190 & PLUSMN; 20 m in the past five decades. With DDh, we also defined the turning point altitude at 5800 m & PLUSMN; 20 m, where Dh began to increase to be less negative with altitude. Moreover, summer temperature change and the number of melting days clearly explained the Dh change with altitude. 4) Glacier contribution to runoff was estimated by 30 & PLUSMN; 16 % from 1974 to 2021, however, our data also showed that approximately 70 % of runoff was from melting glaciers in 2015-2021, implying an amplifying effect of recent global warming on glacier contrubutions. In summary, our findings proved that DDh was an effective indicator for exploring mountain glacier change. The varying results revealed here indicates that more studies would be helpful to define and predict glacier, climatic and hydrological changes in the Mt. Himalayas with multiple techniques and observations based on a common reference over long term.","[Ye, Qinghua; Hu, Yafan; Zhu, Liping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xueqin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuzhe] Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm, Jinan 250358, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhen] Anhui Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Geomatics, Huainan 232001, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yafan; Zhu, Liping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Ye, Qinghua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Ye, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yeqh@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2022,144.0,,,,,,,,109418,10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109418,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109418,,SEP 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000855943000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The investigation tools include major, trace and rare earth element analyses of core sediments, as well as C-14 datings, and O, C isotopic analyses on mollusk shells. The results show that black schists from the Lesser Himalaya highly contributed to the detrital input in Parasi during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition because of focused erosion related to rapid uplift and high rainfall along the Main Central Thrust zone. In addition, aquifer silts, sands, and most of the brown clays underwent a certain degree of chemical weathering and physical reworking, and show possible inputs from the Siwaliks during the Late Holocene. A possible correlation between late Quaternary climate regimes and the concentration of arsenic in sediments is suspected, with arsenic preferentially concentrated during the drier periods of the last 25 kyr BP. The process of arsenic eluviations in sandy and silty sediments can explain the lower arsenic concentrations in sediments during humid periods. During the drier periods, seasonal precipitation was smaller and temperature was lower, leading to wet (less evaporative) soils in swampy environments. This environment favoured the development of aquatic plants and bacteria growing within in the moist land areas, enhancing the strong weathering of initially suspended load particles (micas and clays), which were preferentially deposited in quiet hydraulic environments. These sorting and weathering processes presumably allowed the arsenic to be concentrated in the finest sediment fraction.","[Guillot, Stephane; Garcon, Marion; Tisserand, Delphine; Huyghe, Pascale; Charlet, Laurent] Univ Grenoble Alpes, ISTerre, CNRS, F-38031 Grenoble, France; [Weinman, Beth] Calif State Univ Fresno, Earth & Environm Sci, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Gajurel, Ananta; Upreti, Bishal Nath] Tribhuvan Univ, Inst Sci & Technol, Kathmandu, Nepal; [France-Lanord, Christian] CNRS, Ctr Rech Petrograph & Geochim, F-54501 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [van Geen, Alex] Columbia Univ, Lamont Doherty Earth Observ, Palisades, NY USA; [Chakraborty, Sudipta] Kanchrapara Coll, Dept Chem, Kanchrapara 743145, W Bengal, India",,"Guillot, S (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, ISTerre, CNRS, F-38031 Grenoble, France.",stephane.guillot@ujf-grenoble.fr,,,,,,,,21.0,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2015,74.0,3,,,,,2571,2593,,10.1007/s12665-015-4277-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4277-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000358073800062,View Full Record in Web of Science

The percentages of contaminated wells above 10 and 50 mu g/l are higher than in other arsenic affected states and countries of the Ganga-Meghna-Brahmaputra (GMB) Plain. Unlike on the GMB plains, in Manipur there is no systematic relation between arsenic concentration and the depth of tubewells. The source of arsenic in GMB Plain is sediments derived from the Himalaya and surrounding mountains.

The scarcity of data, however, prevents the application of standard approaches that are based on data-driven models. The Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya mountain range is a crucial area in terms of water resources, but our understanding of the response of its high-elevation catchments to a changing climate is hindered by lack of hydro-meteorological and cryospheric data. Hydrological modeling is challenging here because internal inconsistencies-such as an underestimation of precipitation input that can be compensated for by an overestimation of meltwater-might be hidden due to the complexity of feedback mechanisms that govern melt and runoff generation in such basins. Data scarcity adds to this difficulty by preventing the application of systematic calibration procedures that would allow identification of the parameter set that could guarantee internal consistency in the simulation of the single hydrological components. In this work, we use simulations from the Hunza River Basin in the Karakoram region obtained with the hydrological model TOPKAPI to quantify the predictive power of discharge and snow-cover data sets, as well as the combination of both. We also show that short-term measurements of meteorological variables such as radiative fluxes, wind speed, relative humidity, and air temperature from glacio-meteorological experiments are crucial for a correct parameterization of surface melt processes. They enable detailed simulations of the energy fluxes governing glacier-atmosphere interaction and the resulting ablation through energy-balance modeling. These simulations are used to derive calibrated parameters for the simplified snow and glacier routines in TOPKAPI. We demonstrate that such parameters are stable in space and time in similar climatic regions, thus reducing the number of parameters requiring calibration.","[Pellicciotti, Francesca; Buergi, Cyrill] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn Hydrol & Water Resources Manag, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland; [Immerzeel, Walter Willem] Univ Utrecht, Dept Phys Geog, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Konz, Markus] Risk Management Solut, Zurich, Switzerland; [Shrestha, Arun B.] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Pellicciotti, F (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn Hydrol & Water Resources Manag, Wolfgang Pauli Str 15, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",pellicciotti@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,,,,,,,,115.0,123.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2012,32.0,1,,,,,39,50,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00092.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-11-00092.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000301505500005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Data was subsequently analyzed through diversity indices and multivariate ordination analyses. Five Primula species were recorded from the region including P. macrophylla, P. denticulata, P. rosea, P. elliptica and P. stuartii 1st time reported from the region. The flora associated with the genus Primula consist of 304 plant belonging to 61 botanical families recorded from 880 quadrates (1 m(2)) at the Primula habitats. The frequencies of the Primula species were in order of P. denticulata (54.5%) > P. macrophylla (36.3%) > P. rosea (36.3%) > P. elliptica (13%) > P. stuartii (4.54%). The flora was dominated by the Hemicryptophytic and Geophytic life forms whereas microphylls were the dominant leaf size class. The vegetation communities were characterized with moderate levels of diversity with low maturity index. Ordination significantly explained the species distribution pattern correlated with the geographic attributes and microclimates. P. elliptica and P. stuartii were the rarest Primroses whereas 61 plants were found to be threatened having low (< 0.2) IVI values requiring immediate conservation efforts.

We analyzed the differences in species richness, relative abundance index (RAI), species diversity, and animals' activity pattern among habitats. Total six species were analyzed on activity pattern, which are Takin (Budorcas taxicolor), tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus), Himalayan goral (Naemorhedus goral), wild boar (Sus scrofa), golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus), and porcupine (Hystrix hodgsoni). The results are (1) that there were significant differences in richness and RAI(t) among habitats; (2) Type4 habitat had the highest richness and RAI(t) while Type2 had the highest species diversity; giant pandas were found in these two habitats; (3) there were significant differences in species' activity during daytime and nighttime; and (4) differences appeared in habitat preference of the most abundant species. Takin and tufted deer preferred Type1, Himalayan goral preferred Type2, and golden pheasant preferred Type3. Type4 habitat was used by most animals.

The Pakistani state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has a rich variety of figs. However, no comprehensive study has been carried out to utilise the diversity of these wild figs for possible use in sustainable fruit production. Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the variability of 35 wild fig accessions using quantitative and qualitative traits. Descriptive statistics were used to measure quantitative characteristics, while the coefficient of variance (CV %) was analysed using SAS(R) version 9.1. A principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate analysis were performed using R Studio (v1.1.4). Pearson correlation coefficients between characteristics were obtained using SPSS software. The studied accessions showed high variability and the coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 4.46-14.81%. Days to maturity varied from 71 to 86, leaf area from 38.55 to 90.06 cm(2). The fruit length, fruit diameter and fruit weight ranged from 11.25 to 29.85 mm, 11.85 to 27.49 mm and 2.65 to 9.66 g, respectively. The photosynthetic activity and total chlorophyll content also varied from 7.94 to 10.22 mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1) and 37.11 to 46.48 mu gml(-1). In most of the fig accessions studied, apical dominance was found to be 'absent' while fruit shape was observed to be 'globular'. A strong correlation was observed between all the studied characteristics. In the PCA analysis, all 35 fig accessions were distributed in four quadrants and showed a great diversity. This could be a valuable gene pool for future breeding studies and provide improved quality varieties. Wild Himalayan figs from the wild are well adapted to local pedoclimatic conditions and, combined with easy propagation and production can contribute to the local economy and have a significant impact on the socio-economic and ecological balance. The results of this study show high variability in some of the studied traits of 35 accessions from different parts of Northeast Pakistan, indicating their good potential for further enhancement and utilisation in sustainable agricultural production.","[Khan, Muhammad Riaz; Khan, Muhammad Azam; Habib, Umer] PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Fac Crop & Food Sci, Dept Hort, Rawalpindi 46300, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Riaz; Maqbool, Mehdi] Univ Poonch Rawalakot, Dept Hort, Fac Agr, Rawalakot 12350, Pakistan; [Rana, Rashid Mehmood] PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Fac Crop & Food Sci, Dept Plant Breeding & Genet, Rawalpindi 46300, Pakistan; [Awan, Shahid Iqbal] Univ Poonch Rawalakot, Fac Agr, Dept Plant Breeding & Mol Genet, Rawalakot 12350, Pakistan; [Awan, Shahid Iqbal] Cornell Univ, Cornell AgriTech, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Plant Pathol & Plant Microbe Biol, Geneva, NY 14456 USA; [Duralija, Boris] Univ Zagreb, Fac Agr, Div Hort & Landscape Architecture, Dept Pomol, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",,"Khan, MA (corresponding author), PMAS Arid Agr Univ, Fac Crop & Food Sci, Dept Hort, Rawalpindi 46300, Pakistan.;Maqbool, M (corresponding author), Univ Poonch Rawalakot, Dept Hort, Fac Agr, Rawalakot 12350, Pakistan.",mriazkhan@upr.edu.pk; drazam1980@uaar.edu.pk; umer@uaar.edu.pk; mehdimaqbool@upr.edu.pk; rashid.pbg@uaar.edu.pk; sia23@cornell.edu; bduralija@agr.hr,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,14.0,1,,,,,,,468,10.3390/su14010468,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14010468,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000751326800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The agroecosystems, especially those traditionally managed or organic, are reported to retain high biodiversity including endemic, specialists and conservation concern species. Among others, butterflies are the most vulnerable taxa reacting sensitively and rapidly to climate and habitat changes, and represent as bio-indicators to predict the health of an ecosystem. However, the assessment of land use effect on butterfly diversity has not yet been undertaken in the Eastern Himalayas. Therefore, this study was designed along agroecosystem-forest gradient to understand: the patterns of butterfly alpha diversity taking into account the variation across seasons, elevation, forest specialization and larval host specificity; the patterns of butterfly beta diversity; and plausible environmental determinants of butterfly alpha and beta diversity. We assessed the patterns of taxonomic alpha and beta diversity of butterflies and their determinants in the Indigenous Farming Systems (IFS) {large cardamom-based agroforestry systems (LCAS), mandarin orange-based agroforestry systems (MOAS) and farm-based agroforestry systems (FAS)} along with adjacent natural forests (Forests) in the study area during December 2012-August 2017. We recorded 268 species of butterflies from six families which included two-third forest specialists, one-third monophagous and one-fifth conservation concern species. Along the agroecosystem-forest gradient, alpha diversity of butterflies declined for total, forest specialists, monophagous and protected species. However, pairwise beta diversity increased and the multiple beta diversity was dominated by substitution components. Alpha diversity was determined by tree species richness, tree density, canopy cover, elevation, mean annual precipitation (MAP), season, whereas tree species richness, tree density, tree basal area, canopy cover, elevation, mean annual temperature, and MAP influenced beta diversity. We also identified 15 indicator species dominated by forest specialists suitable for long term ecological monitoring program in the Eastern Himalaya.

Four crucial water quality parameters, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, and pH, were included in the QUAL2K modeling. Furthermore, hydrological processes were modeled using the soil and water assessment tool, and flow was used as an input in the QUAL2K model. The simulated water quality was correlated with fish habitat and analyzed through the analytical hierarchical process (AHP). Results suggested that the habitats of the Kosi were more suitable in the post-monsoon rather than pre-monsoon. Tor putitora, the flagship species of the Kosi, preferred the river habitats with a lower water temperature and higher dissolved oxygen for spawning.

Documentation and analysis of land use change in this region is challenging due to very disparate accounts of the state of forest resources and limited accessible data. Such analysis is, however, important due to concerns over the degradation of forest land leading to deterioration of the protection of water catchments and exposure of highly erodible soils. Furthermore, the area is identified as hotspot for biodiversity loss. The aim of this paper is to identify geophysical and geographical factors related to land use change and model how these relationships vary across the district. For three selected zones across the elevation gradient of the district, we analyse land use change by studying land use maps for the years 1968, 1990 and 2007. In the high-altitude zone, the forest area decreased by 30.5 %, a third of which was caused by agricultural expansion. In the mid-elevation zone, agriculture expanded by 70.3 % and forests decreased by 49.7 %. In the lower altitudes, agriculture expansion was 129.9 % consuming 31.7 % of the forest area over the forty-year time period. Annual deforestation rates observed were 0.80, 1.28 and 1.86 % in high, mid and low altitudes, respectively. In the high-altitude ecosystems, accessibility (distance to nearest road and city) had no significant role in agriculture expansion; rather land use change appears significantly related to geophysical factors such as slope, aspect and altitude. In the low-elevation zone, accessibility was the factor showing the closest association with agriculture expansion and abandonment. The analysis illustrates that land use change processes vary quite considerably between different altitudinal and vegetation cover zones of the same district and that environmental constraints and stage of economic development provide important contextual information.","[Qasim, Muhammad] Abdul Wali Khan Univ, Mardan, Pakistan; [Hubacek, Klaus] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Termansen, Mette] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Fleskens, Luuk] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",,"Qasim, M (corresponding author), Abdul Wali Khan Univ, Mardan, Pakistan.",qasiminleeds@hotmail.co.uk,,,,,,,,32.0,35.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2013,13.0,3,,,SI,,567,581,,10.1007/s10113-012-0395-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-012-0395-1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000319774800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, 212 samples obtained in the mainstream and tributary of YT River in different (wet, normal, and dry) periods were used for the solute apportionment using the mass balance model.

A part of the ions (7.5%) was also originated from the atmospheric precipitation as the abundant rainfall in the wet period. Meanwhile, the contribution of solute sources had no significantly seasonal variation in the upstream, whereas it had significantly seasonal variation in the downstream with the tropical climate and heavy rainfall. Importantly, the rock weathering of the basin could consume so much atmospheric CO2 (0.54% of the consumption at global with the only 0.16% of the global surface area) that could mitigate the global warming, which followed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream.

Limited studies are available on changes in tree diversity, soil nutrients and enzyme activities in response to different intensities of land disturbances in the Himalayan forests. Present study investigated the impact of varying intensities of disturbances on tree diversity and their relationship with soil physical and bio-chemical prop-erties in sal forests, Western Himalayas. Sites were categorized into four different classes of disturbances, namely, No disturbance (ND), Low disturbance (LD), Moderate disturbance (MD), and High disturbance (HD). Composite samples were collected at two depths (0-15 and 15-30 cm) in each plot to investigate soil physical and biochemical properties. Multivariate analyses were conducted to find relationship between tree vegetation and soil physical and biochemical properties. Soil organic carbon (Corg), total nitrogen (Nttl), available phosphorous (Pavl), microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), nitrogen (Nmic), phosphorous (Pmic), and enzymes (dehydrogenase (DHA), Urease, acid and alkaline phospha-tase) followed the order: MD > ND > LD > HD. Across disturbances, soil physical and biochemical characteristics sig-nificantly (p < 0.05) decreased with increasing soil depths. Across the sites, positive correlation was observed among soil microbial biomass, enzymes, Corg, clay, and moisture. Redundancy analysis (RDA) results revealed that species dis-tribution is essential regulator in the variation of prominent soil variables, viz., nutrients (Nttl and Pavl), Cmic, and DHA across disturbance categories and soil depths. Moreover, variance partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that changes in vegetation composition across disturbance levels explain 13.12 % of the variation in soil biochemical subset higher than soil physicochemical subset. The result illustrated that moderate disturbance increases species composition, soil nutrient properties and microbial activity. These findings would help understand microbial activity and its rela-tionship with disturbances, suggesting site-specific measurements for soil nutrient availability and above-below ground interactions.","[Shankar, Anand; Garkoti, Satish Chandra] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India",,"Garkoti, SC (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India.",sgarkoti@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 25,2023,879.0,,,,,,,,163050,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163050,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163050,,APR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000974951600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The (137) Cs and Pb-210 isotope-based sedimentation rate suggest rapid sedimentation in the lake during the last similar to 50 years. The concentrations of Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Co, Ni, Cr metals in the lake sediments owe its contributions both to the natural and anthropogenic sources. Prior to ca 1990 AD, metal loading was dominated by the lithogenic input, whereas post ca 1990 AD the metal loading was controlled by the anthropogenic factors. The Pb concentration in the lake gradually increased during 1990-2004 and then decreased significantly till present. The higher concentration of Pb seems to be derived from the fossil fuel burning, while the Cr concentration in the lake indicates the use of fertilizer in the catchment area. The lowest concentrations of elements around ca 1990 AD seem to have occurred due to channelization of the lake feeding system.","[Meena, Narendra Kumar; Prakasam, M.; Sarkar, Sudipta; Diwate, Pranaya] Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Bhushan, Ravi; Banerji, Upasana] Phys Res Lab, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India; [Banerji, Upasana] Maharaja Sayajirao Univ Baroda, Dept Geol, Vadodara 390002, India",,"Meena, NK (corresponding author), Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",naren@wihg.res.in,,,,,,,,17.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2017,76.0,1,,,,,,,39,10.1007/s12665-016-6303-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-6303-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000392286300039,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, variations in the use of legends and classification systems sometimes pose challenges. The landscape of Sagarmatha National Park and Buffer Zone (SNPBZ) has seen many changes in the past few decades. Mapping of land cover in SNPBZ was carried out to fill gaps in basic databases for the area. A review of past land cover initiatives and existing data revealed differences in methodologies and definitions that made them incompatible for cross-region applications. For the present study, a legend was developed using the standard Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) methodology developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, a comprehensive and standardized a priori classification system designed for mapping exercises independent of scales or means. The changes in land cover were analyzed using Landsat Thematic Mapper, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer images from 1992 to 2006. Land cover maps were generated using object-based image analysis supplemented by ancillary information. Extensive fieldwork was carried out for ground truthing and validation. The use of LCCS was instrumental in bringing general understanding of the classification systems and helping to gain greater clarity and accuracy in the results. About 70% of the SNPBZ area is covered by snow and ice, glaciers, bare rocks, and bare soil. Altitude and its influence on climatic conditions have dominated the distribution pattern of vegetation in SNPBZ. The analysis showed that forest is being converted into shrub at elevations between 3000 and 4000 m, while shrub is decreasing between 4000 and 5000 m. A major decrease in snow cover is seen above 5000 m. Harmonization of the classification system helped to gain more reliable information on changes, as comparisons were made between the classes with consistent definitions.","[Bajracharya, Birendra; Uddin, Kabir; Chettri, Nakul; Shrestha, Basanta; Siddiqui, Salman Asif] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Bajracharya, B (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.",bbajracharya@icimod.org,,,,,,,,39.0,43.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2010,30.0,2,,,,,143,156,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-09-00044.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-09-00044.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000279341600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, poor soil fertility in these areas is a big hurdle to sustainable farming. The effects of washout of topsoil and its nutrients, year after year, due to the abundance of snowfall, avalanches, landslides and erosion further add to the woes of the farmers. In the cold and harsh climatic conditions of the region, with grass and vegetation cover being scanty, it is not possible to maintain large herds of cattle for the adequate production of farmyard manure. Faced with this situation, the locals have relied heavily on obtaining organic manure derived from composting of human excreta. In earlier times the dire necessity of the farmers helped them overcome the revulsion associated with the practice of handling human excreta, but now with the advent of modernisation and the easy availability of chemical fertilisers, the people are distancing themselves from this age-old practice. More and more people are opting for modern toilets and leaving behind the traditional toilets that made possible the harvesting of manure from night-soil. As a result, this primitive practice is on the verge of extinction. This eco-friendly practice, that has sustained the land for so many generations, needs to be continued and strengthened as the long-term consequences of excessive and indiscriminant use of chemical fertilisers are becoming too obvious to ignore. Traditional knowledge needs to be combined with modern scientific know-how to make this practice safer and more acceptable. If the composting operation is managed properly, the handling will be less loathsome and the concerns of health and hygiene too will stand addressed. The present study attempts a detailed profile of the practice of 'supplementing soil nutrients through biocomposting of night-soil' in the cold desert region of Lahaul Valley. Four villages running from the northwestern part to the southeastern part of the valley were selected. The study is broadly based on a direct interview of heads of the various households in the selected villages of Kuthar (2600 m), Hinsa (2700 m), Jahlma (3000 m) and Khoksar (3200 m).

In Nepal in the central Himalaya, five biotic indices have been developed in succession over the last decade to assess the ecological status of rivers, namely: the NEP-bios, BRSbios, GRSbios, HKHbios. and NEPbios-Extended. The implementation of control and protection policies should be based on indices with proven reliability. Such reliability refers to the ability of the index to detect the correct status about the health of the assessed environment. So in the present study, we compare the performance of these five indices to determine the most robust, reliable biotic index for Nepal. In total, 248 biological samples belonging to first- to sixth-order streams were analyzed. Each sampling site was preclassified in situ using a screening protocol and later validated with physicochemical parameters to reflect the actual field condition. Overall, the GRSbios proved to be the most reliable, followed by the NEPbios-Extended, HKHbios, NEPbios, and BRSbios. The results were further validated by the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve method. The study recommends applying the GRSbios to ecologically assess rivers in Nepal. In addition, we discuss modifying the GRSbios method to consider the future impacts of global change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Early melting of surface snow leads to exposing the underneath ice mass to sunlight for longer duration and consequent retreat of glaciers. This retreat of glaciers, further cause several hydrological and climatic implications. In this study, efforts were made to perform source apportionment of the LAIs found in the surface snow samples, collected from the three glaciers located in the Indian Western Himalayas (IWHs). Ionic composition of the snow samples derived from ion chromatography was further analyzed using two receptor models viz., principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). It was observed that biomass burning, vehicular emissions, dust emissions and coal combustion were the major sources of the LAIs in the IWHs. The PMF analysis, estimated that biomass burning and vehicular emissions contributed similar to 30% each in the emission of the LAIs. Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT)-based back trajectories for 7-days were plotted to identify locations of the sources of the LAIs. Back trajectories were observed to pass through agricultural, forest-covered and urban areas. The observations made, during this study, would help local authorities in identifying the hot spots of the LAIs'-emissions, on the basis of which region-specific policies could be framed to mitigate the anthropogenic emissions of the LAIs.","[Thind, Parteek Singh; John, Siby] Punjab Engn Coll, Chandigarh 160012, India; [Kumar, Deepak] Kurukshetra Univ, Dept Geog, Kurukshetra 136119, Haryana, India",,"John, S (corresponding author), Punjab Engn Coll, Chandigarh 160012, India.",johnsiby1@gmail.com,,,,,,,,10.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 1,2021,246.0,,,,,,,,118173,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.118173,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.118173,,JAN 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000634461000022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present paper attempts a spatiotemporal assessment of forest fragmentation and changes in land use land cover ( LULC) pattern using multitemporal satellite data over a time span of around a decade ( 2000-2009), within the third highest protected area ( PA) in the world. The fragmentation analysis using Landscape Fragmentation Tool ( LFT) depicts a decrease in large core, edge and patches areas by 5.93, 3.64 and 0.66 %, respectively, while an increase in non-forest and perforated areas by 6.59 and 4.01 %, respectively. The land cover dynamics shows a decrease in open forest, alpine scrub, alpine meadows, snow and hill shadow areas by 2.81, 0.39, 8.18, 3.46 and 0.60 %, respectively, and there is an increase in dense forest and glacier area by 4.79 and 10.65 %, respectively. The change analysis shows a major transformation in areas from open forest to dense forest and from alpine meadows to alpine scrub. In order to quantify changes induced by forest fragmentation and to characterize composition and configuration of LULC mosaics, fragmentation indices were computed using Fragstats at class level, showing the signs of accelerated fragmentation. The outcome of the analysis revealed the effectiveness of geospatial tools coupled with landscape ecology in characterization and quantification of forest fragmentation and land cover changes. The present study provides a baseline database for sustainable conservation planning that will benefit the subsistence livelihoods in the region.

The present study attempts to exemplify the spatio-temporal variation of hydrological mass over the HGR using time-variable gravity from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite for the period of 2002-2016 on seasonal and interannual timescales. The mass signal derived from GRACE data is decomposed using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), allowing us to identify the three broad divisions of HGR, i.e., western, central, and eastern, based on the seasonal mass gain or loss that corresponds to prevailing climatic changes. Further, causative relationships between climatic variables and the EOF decomposed signals are explored using the Granger causality algorithm. It appears that a causal relationship exists between total precipitation and total water storage from GRACE. EOF modes also indicate certain regional anomalies such as the Karakoram mass gain, which represents ongoing snow accumulation. Our causality result suggests that the excessive snowfall in 2005-2008 has initiated this mass gain. However, as our results indicate, despite the dampening of snowfall rates after 2008, mass has been steadily increasing in the Karakorum, which is attributed to the flattening of the temperature anomaly curve and subsequent lower melting after 2008.","[Munagapati, Harika; Tiwari, Virendra M.] CSIR Natl Geophys Res Inst, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India",,"Tiwari, VM (corresponding author), CSIR Natl Geophys Res Inst, Hyderabad 500007, Andhra Pradesh, India.",hmunagapati@gmail.com; vmtiwari@ngri.res.in,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2021,13.0,2,,,,,,,265,10.3390/rs13020265,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13020265,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000611558300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our analysis projected non-uniform warming but could not validate elevation-dependent warming (EDW) at the basin scale. We obtained more significant warming during the westerly-dominated seasons, with maximum heating during the winter season through T-min changes. The most striking feature is a low-warming monsoon (with the possibility of no change to slight cooling) over the Upper Indus Basin (UIB).

In this study, 99 samples of surface soil were collected from five regions of Nepal on the southern side of the Central Himalayas, and 65 samples of surface soil were obtained from the northern side on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, China (TPC). Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in soils were measured to determine their distribution, potential for accumulation, and sources, as well as risks to humans and the environment. Mean concentrations of Sigma(16)PAHs were 2.4 x 10(2) and 3.3 x 10(2) ng/g dry mass (dm) in soils collected from the TPC and Nepal, respectively. Significant correlations between concentrations of lower molecular weight PAHs (LMW-PAHs) in soils and altitude were found. Total organic carbon (TOC) in soil was positively but weakly correlated with concentrations of PAHs in the study area, which suggested little role of TOC in adsorption of PAHs. The cities of Kathmandu and Pokhara in Nepal and Nyemo (especially Zhangmu Port), Shigatse, and Lhasa on the TPC, were areas with relatively great concentrations of PAHs in soils. The main sources of PAHs identified by positive matrix factorization were emissions from motor vehicles and combustion of coal and biomass in the Central Himalayas. Calculated total benzo[ a] pyrene potency equivalents of 0.23-44 ng/g dm and index of additive cancer risk of 3.8 x 10(-3) - 9.2 x 10(-1) indicated that PAHs in almost all soils investigated posed de minimis risk of additional cancer to residents via direct contact and had no significant risk of additional cancers through consumption of potable water.

The Kedarnath flood completely changed the channel morphology of the Alaknanda river. The river changed its course at Srikot, SSB and Sriyantra Tapu with lower terraces being silted by sands at Ranihat, SSB, Bhaktiyana and Sriyantra Tapu. A new depositional terrace also formed opposite to Sriyantra Tapu. New lateral channel bars, braided channels, back swamp, rapids, pools and river souls were identified in the channel course of the river. Shifting of the channel course at Chauras still remains a serious problem for the Garhwal University Chauras Campus. About 2-5 m silt was deposited on the lower terrace at SSB, and ITI. The Srikot river bed was appended to 4.60 m. Shifting of channel course remains a serious threat to the Srinagar valley.

The toxicity of groundwater associated with the declining water level is reported in recent years. However, an extensive temporal and spatial analysis is required to identify hotspots. In this study, spatial tools are utilized to understand the evolution of groundwater in Punjab (> 315 sites) for the last two decades (2000-2020) for drinking purposes using the water quality index (WQI). The data for pH, electric conductivity (EC), bicarbonate ( HCO3-), chloride (Cl-), sulfate ( SO42-), nitrate ( NO3-), fluoride (F-), calcium ( Ca2+), magnesium ( Mg2+), sodium (Na+), and potassium ( K+) collected from the Central Groundwater Board (CGWB) were analyzed. The results show that the average cation abundance is in declining order of Na > Mg > Ca > K, and anion abundance is in order of HCO3- > SO4 (2-) > Cl- > NO3 > F. The ions are compared with water quality standards defined by BIS and WHO. The study shows that in the year 2000, 69.52% of locations are above the acceptable limit for EC, 68.89% for Mg-2, 84.76% for Na+, 51.75% for HCO3 (-), 38.41% for NO3-, and 17.20% for F-. While in the year 2020, 48.89% exceed the acceptable limit for EC, 57.78% for Mg2+, 68.25% for Na+, 34.92% for WQI shows that in the year 2000, 13.01% of sampling locations are categorized as very poor and 20% as unsuitable for drinking. Meanwhile, in 2020, 6.35% of locations are categorized as very poor and 12.38% as unsuitable for drinking in the study area. In addition to the effect on plant growth, consumption of contaminated water can adversely affect human health. The health hazards for F- (HQF) and NO3- (HQN) and their total health index (THI) are also evaluated that depicts 244 groundwater sampling sites in the year 2000, and 152 sampling sites in the year 2020 show high non-carcinogenic effects on adults, children, and infants. Southwestern Punjab is found to be the worst affected, while north-eastern regions drained by the Himalayan rivers show better quality water.

Glacier melt-water is a non-negligible contributor of river runoff, especially for a drought year. However, the observation of mass glacier changes was scarce in recent years. Here, we estimated the recent glacier mass change of the Geladandong mountain, by differencing the digital elevation models (DEMs) produced from ZiYuan-3 images and TanDEM-X data. Moreover, we compared the SRTM-C DEM with TanDEM-X DEMs to retrieve glacier mass balances since 2000. The annual mass loss rates of -0.11 +/- 0.03 and -0.47 +/- 0.09 m w.e. yr(-1) were derived in 2000-2012 and 2012-2018, respectively. This result revealed an accelerating rate of negative glacier mass changes during recent years, which is mainly caused by the significant increase of mass loss over non-surge glaciers, rather than surge-type glaciers, which held a slight increase of mass loss. In addition, we found a pronounced discrepancy of glacier mass change between non-surge and surge-type glaciers during 2012-2018, and suggested that this difference may be caused by the heterogeneous responses of surge-type glaciers to climate variations, because of the different timing and type of surge events.","[Liu, Lin; Jiang, Liming; Zhang, Zhimin; Wang, Hansheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, State Key Lab Geodesy & Earths Dynam, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Liming] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430071, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lin; Ding, Xiaoli] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China; [Liu, Lin] Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Phys, MOE Key Lab Fundamental Phys Quant Measurement, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Liming] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhimin] Henan Univ Urban Construct, Sch Surveying & Urban Spatial Informat, Pingdingshan 467036, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, LM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geodesy & Geophys, State Key Lab Geodesy & Earths Dynam, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China.;Jiang, LM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430071, Peoples R China.;Jiang, LM (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China.",liulin@whigg.ac.cn; jlm@whigg.ac.cn; zhangzhimin12@mails.ucas.ac.cn; whs@whigg.ac.cn; xl.ding@polyu.edu.hk,,,,,,,,18.0,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2020,12.0,3,,,,,,,472,10.3390/rs12030472,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12030472,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000515393800131,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study has been carried out at three locations along the streamcontinuum, at the glacier snout (0 km), Bhojwasa (4 km) and Gangotri (18 km) covering three consecutive melt seasons from the year 2014 to 2016 and reveals the persistence of closed system conditions along the streamstretch. The year 2014 and 2016 melt seasons experience high p(CO2) closed system conditions associated with high suspended sediment flux, whereas the year 2015 experienced low p(CO2) closed system condition associated with low sediment flux suggesting in-streamsulphide oxidation during high sediment flux years and results into lowvalues of the C-ratio. On the other hand, the melt seasonwith lowsediment flux such as the year 2015 showed dominance of HCO3- over SO42- and higher C-ratio. The study shows that the headwater reach of River Bhagirathi from Gomukh to Gangotri has prevalence of high p(CO2) closed system characteristics associated with high sediment flux and dominance of SO42- during the seasonal peak flow.

Per Capita Fuelwood Consumption (PCFC) was maximum (5.4 +/- 0.30 kg/capita/day) for villages at higher altitude (3800 m) as compared to low altitude (3000 m) village (2.2 +/- 0.36 kg/capita/day) for present study. The energy values follow similar trend; maximum for higher altitude (106.4 MI/capita/day) and minimum for low altitude (43.3 MJ/capita/day). The inhabitants use a total of 14 woody species (3 trees, 11 shrubs) as fuelwood in the cold desert part of KSL. Among these, with high Probability of Use (PU) Juniperus communis (0.86), Pinus wallichina (0.48) and Abies pindrow (0.47) emerged as preferred species and thereby having very high pressure. Likewise, the Resources Use Index (RUI) for fuelwood consumption remained high for Juniperus communis (759.5), Pinus wallichaina (479.2) and Abies pindrow (391). The regeneration status of preferred species and availability (i.e. density) of other species suggested that the long-term persistence of preferred fuelwood species in the landscape is in question. The study provides evidences that the exiting forests, alpine arid scrublands and pasture may face serious problem of degradation in near future if the current trends of fuelwood harvesting continues. This calls for policy and programme level interventions to protect the fuelwood resources and provide better options of energy to poor inhabitants of cold desert area in KSL part of India.

The different source waters exhibit significant spatio-temporal variations that correspond to the change in seasonal meteorology, precipitation form and moisture sources. The two-component hydrograph separation based on d-excess suggests that the western disturbances (WD) contribute dominantly (76 +/- 4 %) to the regional hydrology, compared to Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall (24 +/- 4 %). A comparison of d-excess values of WD and ISM indicates the groundwater consists of 90 +/- 3 % WD sources and 10 +/- 2 % ISM sources, signifying distinct seasonal variations in groundwater recharge sources. The sine wave model results showed that the annual mean residence time (MRT) of groundwater for the Sindh catchment (5.8 +/- 0.6 months) is greater than the Rambiara groundwater (3.6 +/- 0.5 months). The lower isotope values observed in the river water than in the precipitation suggest its origin from the snowmelt.

In this study, we estimated and analyzed changes of the total water budget on the Tibetan Plateau from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission over 15 years prior to 2017. To suppress overall leakage effect of GRACE monthly solutions in Tibet, we applied a forward modeling technique to reconstruct hydrological signals from GRACE data. The results reveal a considerable decrease in the total water budget at an average annual rate of -6.22 +/- 1.74 Gt during the period from August 2002 to December 2016. In addition to the secular trend, seasonal variations controlled mainly by annual changes in precipitation were detected, with maxima in September and minima in December. A rising temperature on the plateau is likely a principal factor causing a continuous decline of the total water budget attributed to increase melting of mountain glaciers, permafrost, and snow cover. We also demonstrate that a substantial decrease in the total water budget due to melting of mountain glaciers was partially moderated by the increasing water storage of lakes. This is evident from results of ICESat data for selected major lakes and glaciers. The ICESat results confirm a substantial retreat of mountain glaciers and an increasing trend of major lakes. An increasing volume of lakes is mainly due to an inflow of the meltwater from glaciers and precipitation. Our estimates of the total water budget on the Tibetan Plateau are affected by a hydrological signal from neighboring regions. Probably the most significant are aliasing signals due to ground water depletion in Northwest India and decreasing precipitation in the Eastern Himalayas. Nevertheless, an integral downtrend in the total water budget on the Tibetan Plateau caused by melting of glaciers prevails over the investigated period.","[Zou, Fang; Tenzer, Robert] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jin, Shuanggen] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Remote Sensing & Geomat Engn, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jin, Shuanggen] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Astron Observ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",,"Tenzer, R (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Land Surveying & Geoinformat, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",fangz070720@gmail.com; robert.tenzer@sgg.polyu.edu.hk; sgjin@shao.ac.cn,,,,,,,,23.0,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 1,2019,11.0,9,,,,,,,1103,10.3390/rs11091103,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11091103,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000469763600111,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Singh, N; Chakrapani, GJ",,,,"Singh, Nandita; Chakrapani, G. J.",,,ANN modelling of sediment concentration in the dynamic glacial environment of Gangotri in Himalaya,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"The present study explores for the first time the possibility of modelling sediment concentration with artificial neural networks (ANNs) at Gangotri, the source of Bhagirathi River in the Himalaya. Discharge, rainfall and temperature have been considered as the main controlling factors of variations in sediment concentration in the dynamic glacial environment of Gangotri. Fourteen feed forward neural networks with error back propagation algorithm have been created, trained and tested for prediction of sediment concentration. Seven models (T1-T7) have been trained and tested in the non-updating mode whereas remaining seven models (T1a-T7a) have been trained in the updating mode. The non-updating mode refers to the scenario where antecedent time (previous time step) values are not used as input to the model. In case of the updating mode, antecedent time values are used as network inputs. The inputs applied in the models are either the variables mentioned above as individual factors (single input networks) or a combination of them (multi-input networks). The suitability of employing antecedent time-step values as network inputs has hence been checked by comparative analysis of model performance in the two modes. The simple feed forward network has been improvised with a series parallel non-linear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) architecture wherein true values of sediment concentration have been fed as input during training. In the glacial scenario of Gangotri, maximum sediment movement takes place during the melt period (May-October). Hence, daily data of discharge, rainfall, temperature and sediment concentration for five consecutive melt periods (May-October, 2000-2004) have been used for modelling. High Coefficient of determination values [ 0.77-0.88] have been obtained between observed and ANN-predicted values of sediment concentration. The study has brought out relationships between variables that are not reflected in normal statistical analysis. A strong rainfall: sediment concentration and temperature: sediment concentration relationship is shown by the models which are not reflected in statistical correlation. It has also been observed that usage of antecedent timestep values as network inputs does not necessarily lead to improvement in model performance.","[Singh, Nandita; Chakrapani, G.

Among the different change detection techniques, change vector analysis (CVA) have an exceptional advantage of discriminating change in terms of change magnitude and vector direction from multispectral bands. The estimation of precise threshold is one of the most crucial task in CVA to separate the change pixels from unchanged pixels because overall assessment of change detection method is highly dependent on selected threshold value. In recent years, integration of fuzzy clustering and remotely sensed data have become appropriate and realistic choice for change detection applications. The novelty of the proposed model lies within use of fuzzy maximum likelihood classification (FMLC) as fuzzy clustering in CVA. The FMLC based CVA is implemented using diverse threshold determination algorithms such as double-window flexible pace search (DFPS), interactive trial and error (T&E), and 3x3aEuro'pixel kernel window (PKW). Unlike existing CVA techniques, addition of fuzzy clustering in CVA permits each pixel to have multiple class categories and offers ease in threshold determination process. In present work, the comparative analysis has highlighted the performance of FMLC based CVA over improved SCVA both in terms of accuracy assessment and operational complexity. Among all the examined threshold searching algorithms, FMLC based CVA using DFPS algorithm is found to be the most efficient method.","[Singh, Sartajvir] Chitkara Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Solan 174103, Himachal Prades, India; [Talwar, Rajneesh] Chandigarh Grp Coll, Tech Campus, Jhanjeri 140307, India",,"Singh, S (corresponding author), Chitkara Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Solan 174103, Himachal Prades, India.",sartajvir.singh@chitkarauniversity.com; rtphdguidance@gmail.com,,,,,,,,10.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2017,14.0,7,,,,,1391,1404,,10.1007/s11629-016-4248-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-016-4248-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000404674600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study investigated the variability of extreme precipitation events over Pakistan on the basis of daily precipitation data from 51 weather stations from 1980-2016. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall, Sen's slope estimator, least squares method, and two-tailed simple t-test methods were used to assess the trend in eight precipitation extreme indices. These indices were wet days (R1 >= 1 mm), heavy precipitation days (R10 >= 10 mm), very heavy precipitation days (R20 >= 20 mm), severe precipitation (R50 >= 50 mm), very wet days (R95p) defining daily precipitation >= 95 percentile, extremely wet days (R99p) defining daily precipitation >= 99 percentile, annual total precipitation in wet days (PRCPTOT), and mean precipitation amount on wet days as simple daily intensity index (SDII). The study is unique in terms of using high stations' density, extended temporal coverage, advanced statistical techniques, and additional extreme indices. Furthermore, this study is the first of its kind to detect abrupt changes in the temporal trend of precipitation extremes over Pakistan. The results showed that the spatial distribution of trends in different precipitation extreme indices over the study region increased as a whole; however, the monsoon and westerlies humid regions experienced a decreasing trend of extreme precipitation indices during the study period. The results of the sequential Mann-Kendall (SqMK) test showed that all precipitation extremes exhibited abrupt dynamic changes in temporal trend during the study period; however, the most frequent mutation points with increasing tendency were observed during 2011 and onward. The results further illustrated that the linear trend of all extreme indices showed an increasing tendency from 1980- 2016. Similarly, for elevation, most of the precipitation extremes showed an inverse relationship, suggesting a decrease of precipitation along the latitudinal extent of the country. The spatiotemporal variations in precipitation extremes give a possible indication of the ongoing phenomena of climate change and variability that modified the precipitation regime of Pakistan. On the basis of the current findings, the study recommends that future studies focus on underlying physical and natural drivers of precipitation variability over the study region.","[Bhatti, Asher Samuel; Wang, Guojie; Ullah, Waheed; Hagan, Daniel Fiifi Tawia; Nooni, Isaac Kwesi; Lou, Dan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Bhatti, Asher Samuel] Bacha Khan Univ Charsadda, Dept Geol, POB 20, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Charsadda, Pakistan; [Ullah, Safi; Ullah, Irfan] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Nooni, Isaac Kwesi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Binjiang Coll, 333 Xishan Rd, Wuxi 214105, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Wang, GJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",asher.samuel@nuist.edu.cn; gwang@nuist.edu.cn; waheed.wama@nuist.edu.cn; safikhali1442@yahoo.com; dans7messiah@nuist.edu.cn; nooni25593@alumni.itc.nl; loudan711@163.com; irfanullahparas92@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,65.0,66.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2020,12.0,3,,,,,,,797,10.3390/w12030797,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12030797,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000529249500182,View Full Record in Web of Science

We analyzed the (i) pattern of tree diversity and its endemic subset (ii) frequency distribution of altitudinal range and (iii) upper & lower distributional limits of each tree species along altitudinal gradients in eastern Himalaya. The study was conducted in Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh. Data on the tree species (cbh >= 15 cm) were gathered every 200 m steps between 200 m and 2200 m gradients. Tree diversity demonstrated a greater variation along the gradients. A total of 336 species (of which 26 are endemic) were recorded belonging to 185 genera and 78 families. The alpha diversity demonstrated a decreasing pattern with two maxima (i.e., elevational peaks) along the gradients; one in 601-1000 m and the other in 1601-1800 m, corresponding to transition zones between tropical-subtropical and subtropical-temperate forests. Pattern diversity revealed a narrow range along the gradients. Frequency of altitudinal range was distributed between 1 and 41. Only one species (Altingia excelsa) showed widest amplitude, occurring over the entire range. Highest level of species turnover was found in 400-600 m step at lower elevational limit whereas for upper elevational limit, the highest turn over was recorded between 800 and 1000 m. Tree diversity decreased and its endemic subset increased along the gradients. Two maximas in tree diversity pattern correspond to forest transition zones with subtropical-temperate transition is narrower than tropical-subtropical. The pattern observed here could be attributed to varied microclimates or environmental heterogeneity. If altitudinal amplitude of a species is considered as an aspect of its niche breadth, it is clear from these results that niche breadth in these organisms is in fact independent of the diversity of the assemblage in which they occur. This analysis calls for detailed floristic studies to determine the breadth of changes between adjacent forest types and details of local species richness in high diversity areas.","Indian Space Res Org, Reg Remote Sensing Serv Ctr, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Forestry & Ecol Div, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Forestry & Ecol Div, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Behera, MD (corresponding author), Indian Space Res Org, Reg Remote Sensing Serv Ctr, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",mukundbehera@gmail.com,,,,,,,,48.0,52.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2007,16.0,6,,,,,1851,1865,,10.1007/s10531-006-9083-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-006-9083-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000247152800018,View Full Record in Web of Science

They are also a valuable freshwater reservoir, flood storage, and species gene pool in Central Asia. This article validated the accuracy of the CryoSat-2 footprints altimetry dataset for the Lake Bosten and Lake Issyk-Kul ranges. The time series for the surface elevations of the Central Asian alpine lakes Karakul and Chatyrkul were established, based on footprints altimetry data. The lake hydrological drivers were analyzed using remote sensing meteorological reanalysis data of the lake basins. The following main conclusions were reached. The CryoSat-2 footprints altimetry dataset has high confidence in lake surface elevation monitoring. Compared with Hydroweb monitoring results, the agreement between the monitoring results in the range between Lake Bosten and Lake Issyk-Kul are 0.96 and 0.84. The surface elevation of Lake Karakul shows an overall increasing trend with a variation rate of +7.7 cm/yr from 2010 to 2020, which has a positive correlation with the temperature in the basin. This indicates that the increased temperature, which results in the increased snow and ice meltwater in the basin, is the main driving force of the increased lake evolution. The lake surface elevation of Lake Chatyrkul shows an overall decreasing trend, with a variation rate of -9.9 cm/yr from 2010 to 2020, which has a negative correlation with the temperature in the basin. This suggests that Lake Chatyrkul is poorly recharged by snow and ice meltwater. The main driving force of its evolution is the increased evaporative output of the lake due to the increase in temperature. These conclusions prove that temperature and alpine glacial variability within the lake basin play an important role in lake surface elevation variations in alpine regions of Central Asia.","[Pan, Yaming; Du, Weibing; Ma, Dandan; Lyu, Xiaoxuan; Cheng, Chaoying] Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Surveying & Land Informat Engn, Jiaozuo 454003, Peoples R China; [Du, Weibing] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Du, Weibing] Xinjiang Key Lab Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Sy, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China",,"Du, WB (corresponding author), Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Surveying & Land Informat Engn, Jiaozuo 454003, Peoples R China.;Du, WB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.;Du, WB (corresponding author), Xinjiang Key Lab Remote Sensing & Geog Informat Sy, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",dwb@hpu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2022,19.0,24,,,,,,,17090,10.3390/ijerph192417090,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph192417090,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000901299700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among all the mountainous glaciated regions, glaciers of Himalayas form one of the largest concentrations of ice outside the Polar Regions. Almost all the major rivers of northern India originate from these glaciers and sustain perennial flow. Therefore, in view of the importance and role of the glaciers in sustaining the life on the Earth, monitoring the health of glaciers is necessary. Glacier's health is monitored in two ways (i) by mapping the change in extent of glaciers (ii) by finding variation in the annual mass balance. This paper has been discussed the later approach for monitoring the health of glaciers of Warwan and Bhut basins. Mass balance of glaciers of these two basins was determined based on the extraction of snow line at the end of ablation season. A series of satellite images of AWiFS sensor were analysed for extraction of snowline on the glaciers for the period of 2005, 2006 and 2007. The snow line at the end of ablation season is used to compute accumulation area ratio (AAR = Accumulation area/Glacier area) for each glacier of basins. An approach based on relationship of AAR to specific mass balance (computed in field) for glaciers of Basapa basin was employed in the present study. Mean of specific mass balance of individual glacier for the year 2005, 2006 and 2007 of Warwan basin was found to be -ve 0.19 m, -ve 0.27 m and -ve 0.2 m respectively. It is 0.05 m, -ve 0.11 m and -ve 0.19 m for Bhut basin. The analysis suggests a loss of 4.3 and 0.83 kmA(3) of glacier in the monitoring period of 3 years for Warwan and Bhut basins respectively. The overall results suggest that the glaciers of Warwan basin and Bhut basins have suffered more loss of ice than gain in the monitoring period of 3 years.","[Brahmbhatt, Rupal M.; Shah, R.

The current 2-year study (October-2017 to September-2019) assessed the physicochemical regime of lower stretches of the Vishav stream, a major left-bank tributary of river Jhelum on a spatiotemporal basis. The physicochemical data was analyzed through linear regression, ANOVA (followed by Duncan's test), multivariate statistical analysis, viz., principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). Linear regression pointed out the nature and magnitude of the relationship between different physicochemical variables (p < 0.05). PCA showed that WT, pH, EC, NO3-N, TDS, TH, and DO are the major factors reflecting the water quality of the Vishav stream. The range in water quality parameters of the Vishav stream was found conducive for the inhabitant fishes. Two well-defined clusters were obtained, wherein Cluster-I comprising of Site-III (a downstream pollution prone site) and Cluster-II comprising of Site-II and Site-I (mid- and upstream site respectively) are less prone to human interferences.

Previous studies at highaltitude observatories have provided evidence of the impact of long-range transport of pollutants from the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). However, little information exists for the valley areas in the high Himalayas where significant local anthropogenic emissions can act as additional sources of short-living climate forcers and pollutants. The valley areas host most economic activities based on agriculture, forestry, and pilgrimage during every summer season. We report here first measurements at a valley site at similar to 2600 m a.s.l. on the trek to the Gangotri glacier (Gaumukh), in the Western Himalayas, where local infrastructures for atmospheric measurements are absent. The study comprised short-term measurement of aerosols, chemical characterization, and estimation of aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) during the winter and summer periods (2015-2016). The particulate matter mass concentrations were observed to be higher than the permissible limit during the summer campaigns. We obtained clear evidence of the impact of local anthropogenic sources: particulate nitrate is associated with coarse aerosol particles, the black carbon (BC) mass fraction appears undiluted with respect tomeasurements performed in the lower Himalayas, and inwinter, both BC and sulfate concentrations in the valley site are well above the background levels reported from literature studies for mountain peaks. Finally, high concentrations of trace metals such as copper point to anthropogenic activities, including combustion and agriculture. While most studies in the Himalayas have addressed pollution in the high Himalayas in terms of transport from IGP, our study provides clear evidence that local sources cannot be overlooked over the high-altitude Himalayas. The estimated direct clear-sky ARF was estimated to be in the range of -0.1 to +1.6Wm(-2), with significant heating in the atmosphere over the highaltitude Himalayan study site.

Analysis of radon data in light of lithological controls and influence of deep-seated thrusts has been made to elucidate the causative factors for anomalous emanation of radon. The lithological types include banded gneisses, schists, quartzite, granite, phyllites, volcanics and mylonites. The low-grade metasedimentries of Shali and Dharamsala generally show low and narrow range of radon concentration in water (5.6-13.4 Bq/l) as well as in soil (1.8-3.2 kBq/m(3)) except for the samples related to thrusts. On the other hand, sheared and deformed rocks of Chail and Jutogh show moderate radon content (average 5.03 kBq/m(3), range 2.9-11.1 kBq/m(3)) in soil. However, the groundwater radon concentration shows wide variation in different types of sources (2.1-80.8 Bq/l). The quartzite and volcanic rocks of Rampur formation in this area present as a window separated by Chail thrust. Radon emanations on these rock types are relatively high (6.3-68.1 Bq/l in water and 5.5-15.9 kBq/m(3) in soil) and are exceptionally high in samples that are related to uranium mineralization, deep-seated thrusts and hot springs (13.5-653.5 Bq/l). It is generally observed that anomalous high radon content is associated with mineralization, deeper source and tectonic discontinuities. Whereas it is obvious that subsurface radioactive mineralization would facilitate enhanced radon production, however, thrust plains provide easy pathways for escape of gases from the deeper sources. Shallow and deep sources of the groundwater have contrasting radon content particularly in the deformed and metamorphosed rocks of Jutogh and Chail. Shallow groundwater sources, mainly handpumps, have lower radon concentration due to limited superficial water circulation, whereas deeper sources, mainly perennial springs, show higher radon content because of larger opportunity for water-rock interaction.","Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; Natl Ctr Res Earthquake Engn, Taipei 106, Taiwan; Guru Nanak Dev Univ, Dept Phys, Amritsar 143005, Punjab, India",,"Choubey, VM (corresponding author), Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, 33 Gen Mahadeo Singh Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India.",vchoubey1@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,,47.0,50.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2007,52.0,6,,,,,1163,1171,,10.1007/s00254-006-0553-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-006-0553-1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000246406900012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The human impacts upon the land are still very great and increasing. This study analyses the process of human-induced landscape transformation in a micro watershed in mid elevation zone of central Himalaya of India in 1963, 1986 and 1996. The watershed (about 80 km(2) in size) comprises a small mountainous valley with steep slopes and deep cut ravines, typical of the landscape pattern in high population intensity mid elevation zone of central Himalaya. The spatial and temporal change patterns of land use were quantified by interpreting remote sensing (RS) data and use a geographical information system (GIS). During the last 33 years, the vegetal cover was altered drastically with increasing population pressure (both human and animal), agricultural activities and industrial wood/raw material extraction activities. The traditional rain fed agriculture on raised terraces has passed through a process of agricultural intensification but this in turn reduced crop species diversity. Restriction on agricultural expansion by transferring large parts of vegetated areas to conservation forestry under government control and unrestrained agricultural expansion on community lands which supported fuel. fodder and manure requirements has resulted in a unbalanced land use. This in turn led to deforestation and environmental degradation. Some limiting factors such as socio-economic and policy forces caused these changes in natural resource management practices and the resulting land use patterns. The study showed that although development interventions such as World Bank aided Integrated Watershed Development Programme, etc., showed promising results in regenerating the resources, the lack of follow-up required after programme withdrawal might cause the deterioration of resources accrued during such regeneration activities.

It is the rising public health issue prevalent in the Himalayan range of Pakistan. The young and educated population is more prone to suicide instead of using this prime phase of age productively. Unfortunately, the suicide problem remains unaddressed, the causes remain undefined, solutions are not in the works, and in situations when others play a part in driving someone to commit suicide, no one is being held accountable. This study is aimed at uncovering the root causes of suicide and proposing some preventive measures to mitigate the problem. Our team studied three years' worth of data (2017-2019) on suicides from the office of Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, Chitral. In addition, we conducted semi-structured interviews of different stakeholders, including family members, neighbors, lawyers, and police personnel. The findings revealed that extended family pressures, the power dynamic between sustainers and dependents, family conflicts, and inheritance cases were the major causes of the domestic violence that preceded suicide attempts. Mental health issues, forced marriages, academic competitions, and flawed litigation processes were also among the leading causes of suicide. Awareness through education and religious sermons, strengthening healthcare organizations, restructuring family systems, establishing police complaint centers, effective prosecution processes, and imparting lifesaving skills have been identified as measures to prevent suicide. This study has theoretical and practical implications, as it adds certain novel variables regarding the causes and solutions of suicide to the existing body of literature and guides public authorities to strengthen institutions to intervene effectively.","[Ullah, Zia] Lahore Leads Univ, Fac Business Adm, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Shah, Nighat Akbar] Adur Prod LLC, Memphis, TN 38125 USA; [Khan, Sonia Shamroz] Chitral Police Serv Pakistan, Chitral 17200, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Naveed] Univ Cent Punjab, Fac Management Studies, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Naveed] Virtual Univ Pakistan, Dept Management Sci, Lahore 54000, Pakistan; [Scholz, Miklas] Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Fac Engn, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Scholz, Miklas] Univ Johannesburg, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Dept Civil Engn Sci, Kingsway Campus,Auckland Pk 2006, ZA-2092 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Scholz, Miklas] Natl Res Univ, South Ural State Univ, Dept Town Planning Engn Networks & Syst, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Scholz, Miklas] Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Environm Engn, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland",,"Ullah, Z (corresponding author), Lahore Leads Univ, Fac Business Adm, Lahore 54000, Pakistan.;Scholz, M (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Div Water Resources Engn, Dept Bldg & Environm Technol, Fac Engn, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Scholz, M (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Sch Civil Engn & Built Environm, Dept Civil Engn Sci, Kingsway Campus,Auckland Pk 2006, ZA-2092 Johannesburg, South Africa.;Scholz, M (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ, South Ural State Univ, Dept Town Planning Engn Networks & Syst, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;Scholz, M (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Environm & Life Sci, Inst Environm Engn, PL-50375 Wroclaw, Poland.",chairperson.ba@leads.edu.pk; contact@adurproductions.com; sonia.shamroz@gmail.com; naveeddgk2010@gmail.com; miklas.scholz@tvrl.lth.se,,,,,,,,26.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2021,18.0,20,,,,,,,10880,10.3390/ijerph182010880,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182010880,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000715319400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is largely unknown whether long-term temperate fruit farming has adverse effects on the soil fertility in NWH or not. Therefore, we conducted a study with the purpose of evaluating the impact of different land uses in the NWH ecosystem, namely: peach orchard (PO), apple orchard (AO), fertile-fallow land (FL), and barren land (BL) on soil physico-chemical characters, nutrient storage capacity, and soil quality index (SQI), along a soil-depth gradient. A total of 116 composite soil samples [four treatments (i.e., land uses), 4- soil depths (0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, and 0.6-0.8 m) and 5, 9, 9, and 6 replications for PO, AO, FL, and BL systems, respectively] were collected for laboratory analyses. Across depths, the soils under temperate fruit plantations had better soil physical conditions (i.e., lower bulk density and higher porosity) over FL and BL lands. The soils in this study can be categorized as slightly acidic to near neutral in soil reaction. Soils under temperate fruit plantations (PO and AO), averaged over depths, had significantly (p < 0.05) less quantity of soil organic C, available nutrients (i.e., primary-, secondary-, and micro-nutrients), nutrient storage capacity, and indices of soil quality, as compared to FL lands. These unfavourable effects were augmented in subsoils (0.2-0.8 m) than topsoils (0.0-0.2 m) affecting secondary- and micro-nutrients more than primary-nutrients. Results further revealed that these lands display a less favourable (i.e., very high) C:N ratio that could easily be degraded if brought under intensive farming. Restoration of depleted soil fertility in temperate fruit-tree-based ecosystems of NWH could be achieved through incentive-based building-up of soil organic matter and adoption of a soil-test-based nutrient management regime.","[Debnath, Sovan; Kishor, Arun; Kumar, Anil] Indian Council Agr Res ICAR Cent Inst Temperate H, Reg Stn Mukteshwar, Naini Tal 263138, Uttarakhand, India; [Purakayastha, Tapan Jyoti] ICAR Indian Agr Res Inst, Div Soil Sci & Agr Chem, New Delhi, India; [Kumar, Anil] ICAR Directorate Mushroom Res, Solan, Himachal Prades, India; [Bhowmik, Arpan] ICAR Indian Agr Stat Res Inst, Div Design Expt, New Delhi, India; [Bhowmik, Arpan] ICAR Indian Agr Res Inst, Gogamukh, Assam, India",,"Debnath, S (corresponding author), Indian Council Agr Res ICAR Cent Inst Temperate H, Reg Stn Mukteshwar, Naini Tal 263138, Uttarakhand, India.",Sovan.Debnath@icar.gov.in,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2022,33.0,17,,,,,3484,3496,,10.1002/ldr.4402,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4402,,AUG 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000834724600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A geochemical and sedimentological study was done to ascertain the origin and geographical distribution of As in surface water and fluvial sediment collected from the floodplains/basins of the River Indus and its four major tributaries that drain through the northern Pakistan. The hydrogeochemical compositions of all five rivers were similar with calcium (Ca2+) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) being the dominating ions. The concentration of As ranged from 0.62e24.05 mg/L (average 3.7 +/- 3.5 mg/L, n = 61) in river water, 2.3 e23.4 mg/kg (average 5.7 +/- 3.9 mg/kg) in suspended sediment, and 2.0e13 mg/kg (average 4.13 +/- 2.3 mg/kg) in fluvial sediment. Various approaches were used, including mineralogical, sequential extraction, geochemical, and statistical analyses to investigate the distribution, behavior, and potential sources of As in the sediment. The effect of geological factors on the distribution of As was also studied. No noticeable changes in the relative abundance of minerals were observed in the sediment at different locations along the river. Both mineralogical and statistical analyses showed that silicate minerals like muscovite, biotite, and chloride are the main As reservoir while oxides minerals like hematite and magnetite, which are minor components in the sediment are second largest As carrier. A geochemical baseline, using the normalization and cumulative frequency distribution curves was constructed for As. The estimated mean human contribution of As was 3.4% in the Indus River, 1.9% in the Jhelum River, 13.7% in the Chenab River, 17.5% in the Ravi River and 5.4% in the Sutlej River, indicating relatively higher effects of anthropogenic activity along the Chenab River and Ravi River. The almost negligible effects of anthropogenic activities were additionally confirmed through the pollution assessment parameters estimated from the geo-enrichment, contamination factors, and accumulation index analyses. The current data suggest that As transported by the Indus River and its major tributaries is accumulated in the sediment and is potentially incorporated in the sedimentary aquifers situated along the Indus Basin and surrounding areas. Based on the current study, it is concluded that the source of As is dominantly geogenic whereas the role of anthropogenic activities is considered negligible except along the Ravi River which showed relatively a higher percentage (17.5%) of human or industrial contribution.

Spatially heterogeneous melt patterns caused by the development and evolution of ice cliffs and supraglacial pond systems result in substantial mass losses over time. However, mechanisms controlling the formation and survival of cliffs and ponds remain largely unknown. To study the distribution and characteristics of these surface features we deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over a stretch of the debris-covered Langtang Glacier, Nepal. Acquired images are processed into high-resolution orthomosaics and elevation models with the Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry algorithm. Ice cliffs and ponds are classified using object-based image analysis (OBIA) and their morphology and spatial distribution are analysed and evaluated using object, pixel and point cloud approaches. Results show that ice cliffs are predominantly north-facing, and larger ice cliffs are generally coupled with supraglacial ponds, which may affect their evolution considerably. The spatial distribution of ice cliffs indicates that they are more likely to form in areas where high strain rates are expected. The spatial configuration of ponds over the entire tongue reveals high pond density near confluences, possibly due to closure of conduits via transverse compression. We conclude that the combination of OBIA and UAV imagery is a valuable tool in the semi-automatic and objective analysis of surface features on debris-covered glaciers. The technique may also have potential for upscaling to the use of spaceborne imagery, and the use of UAV-derived point clouds to analyse ice cliff undercuts is promising. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Alpine meadow and the legumes Oxytropis and Chesneya were critical resources for all animal groups. High overlap occurred cross-seasonally when smallstock (sheep and goats) in summer used the spring and autumn ranges of naur. Relatively high total ungulate biomass (3028 kg km(-2)) and low recruitment of naur (56 young per 100 adult females in autumn) suggested interspecific competition. The spatio-temporal heterogeneity ill composition and phenology of food plants across the steep gradient of altitude, together with rotational grazing, appears to indirectly facilitate coexistence of naur and smallstock. However, owing to high cross-seasonal (inter-seasonal) overlaps, competition is likely to occur between these two groups at high stocking densities. Within seasons, naur overlapped more with free-ranging yak than with smallstock. As their habitat use and diets were most similar in winter, when both fed extensively on the same species of shrubs, naur was most likely to compete with yak during that season.","[Shrestha, Rinjan; Wegge, Per] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, NO-1432 As, Norway; [Shrestha, Rinjan] World Wildlife Fund, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Shrestha, R (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Nat Resource Management, POB 5003, NO-1432 As, Norway.",rinjan@gmail.com,,,,,,,,40.0,45.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2008,35.0,2,,,,,125,136,,10.1017/S0376892908004724,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892908004724,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000258857200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The site-specific soil management zones (MZs) are necessary for such terrain with variability in spatial soil nutrient distribution. The present study investigates the spatial variability of soil nutrients and delineates the MZs in a mid-Himalayan watershed. Overall, 100 m grid 65 surface soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected from an area of 102 ha mini watershed located in the Tehri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand state in India. The samples were processed and analyzed for soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), aggregate stability (AS), clay content (Cl), total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorous (AP) and available potassium (AK). The soil pH, EC, AS, Cl, TC, AP, AK and TN had mean values of 5.15, 104.57 dS cm(-1), 0.80, 17.78%, 2.55%, 32.14 kg ha(-1), 163.59 kg ha(-1) and 0.24%, respectively. Geostatistical analysis showed a spatial distribution pattern of soil variables with moderate to weak spatial dependency. The principal component analysis (PCA) divulged five principal components (PCs) with eigenvalue > 1 with 69.48% total variance. The fuzzy c means algorithm for the scores of the selected PCs was carried out to establish the optimum number of clusters, i.e., management zones (MZs). The geostatistical analysis, PCA and fuzzy clustering resulted in four optimum soil management zones. The analysis of variance indicated that there is a significant difference between the soil and terrain parameters among the MZs. The soil pH and TN among MZ1 and MZ4, whereas the EC, AK, TC and elevation were significantly different among all the delineated MZs. In addition, the delineated MZs using cluster analysis resulted in within-zone variability and could be used as a guide for farmers to adopt site-specific soil management.","[Shashikumar, B.

Parameters describing these attributes are generally measured in soil samples collected from a few locations through cumbersome laboratory methods. Although diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) can rapidly yield estimates for soil attributes in samples collected from specific locations and digital soil mapping (DSM) can transform such discrete measurements into spatially-continuous inference systems, these two technologies are rarely used for assessing OVM risks. In this study, we combined the DRS and DSM approaches for deriving spatially-continuous estimates for the key vehicle mobility parameters (gravel, sand, and fine particles; C-u: coefficients of uniformity; C-c: coefficient of curvature; LL; and PI) and classified soils using the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). A total of 204 soil samples were collected from the north-eastern Himalayan state of Sikkim for measuring these parameters along with spectral reflectance over the visible and near-infrared region. Results of the chemometric models in the DRS approach showed that the USCS parameters may be estimated with the coefficient of determination (R-2) values as high as 0.72. The fine (<2 mm diameter) fraction spectra provided the best estimates for the Atterberg limits while a combination of spectra collected from fine and coarse (>2 mm diameter) fractions was effective in estimating other granulometric fractions except for sand, which was best estimated using the coarse fraction spectra. With the DSM approach allowing effective mapping of these parameters, a spatially-continuous framework to quantify soil-associated OVM risks was developed for Sikkim for the first time.","[Purushothaman, Naveen K.; Reddy, Nagarjuna N.; Majeed, Israr; Das, Bhabani S.] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Agr & Food Engn Dept, Kharagpur 721302, West Bengal, India; [Chowdhury, Pinaki Roy] Def Res & Dev Org, Def Geoinformat Res Estab, Sect 37-A, Chandigarh 160036, India",,"Das, BS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Agr & Food Engn Dept, Kharagpur 721302, West Bengal, India.",naveenpurushothaman1098@gmail.com; nreddy187@gmail.com; resheisrar@gmail.com; pinaki.dgre@gov.in; bsdas@agfe.iitkgp.ac.in,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2024,351.0,,,,,,,,119874,10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119874,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.119874,,DEC 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001165215400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

PM2.5 was collected daily (24 h, once a week) over a year to assess monthly and seasonal variations in NPOC concentration and their source(s) activity. Samples were analyzed on thermal desorption-gas chromatography mass spectrometry to identify and quantify source-specific organic markers. Homologous series of n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), isoprenoid hydrocarbons and nicotine were investigated to understand the sources of aerosols in the region. The annual mean concentration of PM2.5 during the sampling period was found higher than the permissible limit of India's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. The rise of concentration for PM2.5 and associated NPOCs in summer season was attributed to enhanced emission. The n-alkane-based diagnostic parameters indicated mixed contributions of NPOCs from anthropogenic sources like fossil fuel-related combustion with significant inputs from biogenic emission. Moreover, high influence of petrogenic contribution was observed in summer (monsoon) months. The quantifiable amounts of isoprenoid hydrocarbons further confirmed this observation. Total PAH concentration also followed an increasing trend from March to June, and June onwards a sharp decrease was observed. The higher concentration of environmental tobacco smoke marker nicotine in winter months was plausibly due to lower air temperature and conditions unfavourable to photo-degradation. A clear dominance of low molecular weight PAHs was noticed with rare presence of toxic PAHs in the ambient atmosphere of Jammu. PAH-based diagnostic parameters suggested substantial contribution from low temperature pyrolysis processes like biomass/crop-residue burning, wood and coal fire in the region. Specific wood burning markers further confirmed this observation.","[Yadav, Shweta; Bamotra, Sarita] Cent Univ Jammu, Dept Environm Sci, Jammu 181143, J&K, India; [Bamotra, Sarita; Tandon, Ankit] Cent Univ Himachal Pradesh, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Kangra 176215, HP, India",,"Yadav, S (corresponding author), Cent Univ Jammu, Dept Environm Sci, Jammu 181143, J&K, India.",shweta.evs@cujammu.ac.in,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2020,27.0,15,,,SI,,18875,18892,,10.1007/s11356-020-08374-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08374-3,,MAR 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000521687600022,View Full Record in Web of Science

K.",,,Variations in particulate matter over Indo-Gangetic Plains and Indo-Himalayan Range during four field campaigns in winter monsoon and summer monsoon: Role of pollution pathways,ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Both in-situ and space-borne observations reveal an extremely high loading of particulates over the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), all year around. With a burgeoning population and combustion sources (fossil fuels (FFs) and biofuels (BFs)) in close proximity to each other, the IGP is widely regarded as a hotspot for anthropogenic aerosol emission in South Asia. The deteriorating air quality over this region, particularly during winters, is a cause of major concern, since the pollutants undergo long range transport from their source regions to the Indo-Himalayan Range (IHR), Bay of Bengal (BoB) and other remote areas, polluting their pristine atmospheric conditions. Seasonal reversal in winds over the Indian mainland leads to an outflow of continental pollutants into the BoB during winters and a net advection of desert dust aerosols into the IGP from southwest Asia (SW-Asia), northwest India (NW-India) and northern Africa (N-Africa) during summers. Through the course of this study, four observational campaigns were conducted for sampling the ambient PM2.5 and PM10 during winter and summer seasons of 2014-2015, at multiple locations (18 sites) in the IGP, IHR, and semi-arid/arid sites towards their south and west, in order to accurately determine the inter-seasonal and inter-annual changes in the aerosol loading at the sites. We have also utilized data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite for estimating the columnar Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm (AOD(550)) and data from EOS Terra and Aqua satellites for discovering openly burning fires in the vicinity of sampling sites. Determination of the major source regions and key transport pathways during both seasons have also been attempted, using back-trajectory cluster analyses, as well as receptor models such as PSCF and CWT.

Solms. under different trophic conditions in wetlands of eastern Himalayan foothills,ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Response of decomposition rate (k) and nutrient release pattern of leaves, petioles and roots of Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth) to different trophic conditions were studied in three wetlands (Eutrophic-Dulikoto, Mesotrophic-Pichola Nishi and Oligotrophic-Nirjuli) located in the foothills of Arunachal Pradesh in the eastern Himalayan region. Significant differences in the C, N, P, K, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose contents and C/N and C/P ratios were recorded in different plant parts of water hyacinth and also between wetlands. The decomposition rates (k) were also significantly (P < 0.05) different between trophic conditions (F = 702.16) and plant parts (F = 1558.09). The decay constants revealed that the decomposition rates were faster in petioles (0.0252-0.0455k day(-1)), followed by the leaves (0.0176-0.0396k day(-1)) and the roots (0.0083-0.0130k day(-1)). Potassium mineralisation and turnover rates were higher than that of C, N and P. In general, the turnover rate was faster in the leaves and petioles of Eichhornia crassipes, which varied from 22 to about 57 days under different trophic conditions studied. Roots, however, decomposed slowly (77-121 days). The k values were strongly correlated with C, N, P, C/N and C/P. Overall, the higher turnover rate indicates that water hyacinth can accelerate the nutrient recycling potential in wetlands whereby the total ecosystem services could be judiciously regulated temporally. Further, the present study could serve as a template model to assess and predict the effect of nutrient loading in the wetlands upon decay of floating aquatic macrophytes.

Terrain attributes elevation, slope gradient and upslope catchment area (UCA) and terrain indices [ terrain wetness index (TWI), water power index (WPI) and sediment transport index (STI)] were derived from DTM and evaluated for their potential in soil nutrients mapping. These nutrients showed positive correlation with UCA, TWI, SPI and STP terrain indices. Among these terrain indices, TWI showed highest correlation coefficient for TC (r(2) = 0.71), N (r(2) = 0.67) and P (r(2) = 0.66) followed by WPI and STI. Geostatistical analyses used to map these nutrients, co-kriging with TWI + NDVI, TWI and slope as co-variables, had improved the spatial prediction to 60.46, 55.81, 44.18 % for TC and 33.63, 21.78, 17.82 % for N, respectively, contrary to ordinary kriging. The prediction accuracy for P was improved with co-variables of TWI + NDVI and TWI by 30.03 and 4.50 %, respectively.

Here, we analyzed forest stand characteristics, carbon stocks and soil properties of north- and south-facing slopes in a trans-Himalayan semiarid valley. Pinus wallichiana was the dominant and Juniperus indica the co-dominant species in both aspects, whereas Betula utilis and Abies spectabilis were only recorded in north-facing forests. Pinus regenerated in both aspects, whereas Juniperus did not. Carbon stocks did not differ between aspects; 33 t/ha in north-facing and 31 t/ha in south-facing forests. Similarly, soil properties did not vary between slope aspects, expect for potassium (highest in south-facing slopes). These results suggest that topographic factors affect mountain forests through their direct influence on radiation and moisture, but that human disturbance also plays a significant role affecting vegetation and soil characteristics in a semiarid environment. These natural and anthropogenic factors may play in harmony or in discord with each other.

The present study seeks to find out the impact of population growth and road network expansion on forest cover of Palas valley based on remotely sensed data and employing geospatial techniques. Changes in forest cover were determined by classifying time-series satellite images of Landsat and Sentinel 2A. The images of October 1980, 2000, 2010 and 2017 were classified into six land cover classes and then the impact of population growth and accessibility on forest cover was analyzed. Furthermore, forest cover and land-use change detection map was prepared using classified images of 1980 and 2017. The data were collected mainly from field visits (ground verification), census reports, Communication and Works Department, Kohistan. Satellite imageries were obtained from the United States Geological Survey's websites and classified in ERDAS imagine 2014 and ESRI ArcGIS 10.2.1 using supervised classification-maximum likelihood algorithm.

The lake catchment, spread over an area of about 11 km(2), is covered by different land cover types including wasteland (36%), rocky outcrops (30%), agriculture (12%), plantation (12.2%), horticulture (6.2%) and built-up (3.1%) The GIS-based distributed modeling approach employed relied on the use of geospatial data sets for simulating runoff, sediment, and nutrient (N and P) loadings from a watershed, given variable-size source areas, on a continuous basis using daily time steps for weather data and water balance calculations. The model simulations showed that the highest amount of nutrient loadings are observed during wet season in the month of March (905.65 kg of dissolved N, 10 kg of dissolved P, 10,386.81 kg of total N and 2,381.89 kg of total P). During the wet season, the runoff being the highest, almost all the excess soil nutrients that are trapped in the soil are easily flushed out and thus contribute to higher nutrient loading into the lake during this time period. The 11-year simulations (1994-2004) showed that the main source areas of nutrient pollution are agriculture lands and wastelands. On an average basis, the source areas generated about 3,969.66 kg/year of total nitrogen and 817.25 kg/year of total phosphorous. Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of correlation between the daily observed and predicted nutrient load ranged in value from 0.80 to 0.91 for both nitrogen and phosphorus.","[Romshoo, Shakil Ahmad; Muslim, Mohammad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Geol & Geophys, Srinagar 190006, Kashmir, India",,"Romshoo, SA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Geol & Geophys, Srinagar 190006, Kashmir, India.",shakilrom@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,35.0,36.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2011,64.0,5,,,,,1269,1282,,10.1007/s12665-011-0944-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-011-0944-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000295845900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Collaborative learning is considered to be a feasible strategy for livelihood resilience among vulnerable communities experiencing such stressors. Taking insights from social-ecological resilience theory, this study discusses how Adi community, living in the ecologically fragile ecosystems of Arunachal Pradesh, India, has developed a location-specific biocultural resource-based adaptive strategy to enhance their livelihood resilience. A novel participatory approach-'recipe contest'-was used to mobilize Adi women from 11 villages of the state's East Siang district with overall aim of developing nutritious and culturally relevant food products based entirely on local resources and knowledge. A total of 43 women (winners of the recipe contests) and 33 other knowledgeable community members (total 76 participants), by participating in focus group discussions and personal interviews, shared their knowledge and experiences relating to local foods and sustainability. We found that a range of climatic, ecological, socioeconomic and political stressors were adversely impacting Adi women's subsistence livelihoods. Through community mobilization, these women formed Self-Help Groups (SHGs) and together they developed a marketable product, 'Adi Siang Nutri', with ingredients provided by 12 local species. This value-added product, integrated with local livelihood trajectories, helped diversify and increase the Adi women's income, allowing them to better safeguard themselves from aforementioned risks. The local species used as the ingredients are being conserved, and have several perceived socio-cultural, ecological and ethnomedicinal benefits. This participatory action research promises to make a significant change in the social-ecological resilience and associated biocultural resources of Adi women. Our findings provide valuable insights for several food, nutritional security and environmental policies to improve social-ecological resilience using biocultural resources.","[Singh, Ranjay K.; Bhardwaj, Rakesh; Sureja, Amish K.; Hazarika, B.

The concentration of heavy metals was relatively high in the post monsoon season as compared to the pre monsoon season. The concentration of Cd was 69% in sediment samples that exceeded the TEC value while none of the metal concentration exceeded PEC. The mean PEC quotient value among different sampling sites ranged between 0.14 and 0.43. The I-geo indicated that surface sediments of River Soan were moderately polluted with Cd (1.42). The EF indicated significant pollution of Cd (12.01) and moderate pollution of Pb (4.05) in sediments, and indicated the influx of Cd and Pb in sediments from anthropogenic sources.

Resource uses, management practices, economy and people's perceptions of problems and likely solutions were analysed in two villages near and two villages away from the core zone of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve in the Indian Himalaya. Agriculture, although practised on less than 1% of the area, was the primary occupation of local people. Six annual crops of a total of 22 and all four horticultural crops on private farms were damaged by wildlife, but Reserve management provided compensation only for livestock killing by wildlife and compensation amounted to only 4-10% of the total assessed monetary value of killed livestock. A variety of wild plant products were used locally but 27 were marketed by more than 50% of surveyed families; income from wild products was substantially lower than that from crops and livestock. A sociocultural change from a subsistence to a market economy, together with changes in traditional land/resource rights and institutions, has led to a number of changes in land-use and management practices. The livestock population has declined, agricultural area has remained the same and people have started cultivating medicinal species in the last 20 years. These changes seem complementary to the goal of conservation. However, changes such as abandonment of some traditional food crops and stress on cash crops lacking fodder value, requiring substantial manure inputs derived from forest litter and livestock excreta, and causing severe soil erosion, seem to counter the goal of environmental conservation. Some government-managed Reserve Forest sites were similar to the Community Forests in terms of species richness, basal area and soil physico-chemical properties. Two Reserve Forest sites showed basal areas of 160.5-191.5 m(2)/ha, exceeding the highest values reported so far from the region. The formal institutional framework of resource management seems to be not as effective as the traditional informal system. The Reserve Management Plan lays more emphasis on legal protection than on the sustainable livelihood of local communities and has led to conflicts between local people and reserve managers. Plantation of fodder and medicinal species in degraded forest lands, suppression of economic exploitation of local people in the market, enhancement of local knowledge of the economic potential of biodiversity, incentives for cultivation of crops with comparative advantages and lesser risks of damage by wildlife, and rejuvenation of the traditional involvement of the whole village community in decison-making, could be the options for resolving conflicts between people and protected areas in this case.","GB Pant Inst Himalayan Environm & Dev, Garhwal Unit, Srinagar 246174, Uttarakhand, India; GB Pant Inst Himalayan Environm & Dev, Sustainable Dev & Rural Ecosyst Programme, Kosi Katarmal 263643, Almore, India; Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India",,"GB Pant Inst Himalayan Environm & Dev, Garhwal Unit, PB 92, Srinagar 246174, Uttarakhand, India.",,,,,,,,,82.0,105.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2000,27.0,1,,,,,43,53,,10.1017/S0376892900000060,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892900000060,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000087539600006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study compares seasonal glacier dynamics (cold and warm seasons) in the ablation zone of Parlung No. 4 Glacier, a temperate glacier in the monsoon-influenced southeastern Tibetan Plateau, by using repeat unpiloted aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys combined with Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry and ground stake measurements. Our results showed that the surveyed ablation zone had a mean change of -2.7 m of ice surface elevation during the period of September 2018 to October 2019 but is characterized by significant seasonal cyclic variations with ice surface elevation lifting (+2.0 m) in the cold season (September 2018 to June 2019) but lowering (-4.7 m) in the warm season (June 2019 to October 2019). Over an annual timescale, surface lowering was greatly suppressed by the resupply of ice from the glacier's accumulation area-the annual emergence velocity compensates for about 55% of surface ablation in our study area. Cold season emergence velocities (3.0 +/- 1.2 m) were similar to 5-times larger than those observed in the warm season (0.6 +/- 1.0 m). Distinct spring precipitation patterns may contribute to these distinct seasonal signals. Such seasonal dynamic conditions are possibly critical for different glacier responses to climate change in this region of the Tibetan Plateau, and perhaps further afield.","[Yang, Wei; Zhao, Chuanxi; Yao, Tandong; Wang, Yongjie; He, Zhen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wei; Yao, Tandong] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wei; Wang, Yongjie] South East Tibetan Plateau Stn Integrated Observa, Lulang 860119, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Chuanxi; He, Zhen] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Westoby, Matthew; Pellicciotti, Francesca] Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci Engn & Environm, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Pellicciotti, Francesca; Miles, Evan] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Zhou, Jianmin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital, Earth, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China",,"Yang, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Yang, W (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Yang, W (corresponding author), South East Tibetan Plateau Stn Integrated Observa, Lulang 860119, Peoples R China.",yangww@itpcas.ac.cn; zcx@itpcas.ac.cn; matt.westoby@northumbria.ac.uk; tdyao@itpcas.ac.cn; wyj@itpcas.ac.cn; francesca.pellicciotti@wsl.ch; zhoujm@radi.ac.cn; hhuhz114@163.com; evan.miles@wsl.ch,,,,,,,,24.0,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2020,12.0,15,,,,,,,2389,10.3390/rs12152389,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12152389,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000559027400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present study, prospects of cryosphere-fed irrigation were investigated through adopting topographic suitability and water availability indexing approach to broaden the base of agriculture and socio-economic activities in the UIB of Pakistan. Topographic suitability for crop farming was found high (<15 degrees slope below 3000 m) over 47.8% area of the Swat, 23.6% of the Indus, 16.6% of the Jhelum basin and overall 14.6% of the UIB region. This land can be developed through kuhl systems subject to availability of sufficient water resources. The glacier-melt was found >8.0 liters/sec/hectare in the Karakoram basins, i.e., Hunza, Shigar and Shyok, and within 4.0-8.0 lps/ha in the Chitral and Astore river basins. The scarcity of land and water was found (one at a time or both at once) at certain locations which may impact agricultural productivity in the region. In places with limited land for farming opportunities, the basis of livelihoods can be broaden through diversifying income sources, e.g. availing off-farm and nonlocal income opportunities. However, while framing adaptation process, the socio-political complexity of the area should be taken into account, as optimum integration of natural and socioeconomic aspects would ensure sustainable development in this high altitude region in future.

These forests are under considerable conversion pressure as land use intensifies with expanding human population and economic development. Conservation strategies based on the geographic patterns of botanical species richness, including the identification of meaningful floristic regions and priority areas for conservation, could improve the effectiveness of forest policy and management. These strategies should also include current threats of loss due to forest conversion to address the more urgent challenges for sustainable development. Here, we produce distribution models at similar to 10 km(2) resolution for 2319 plant species, using geo-referenced herbarium collections, corrected for spatial bias using a null model, and detailed environmental variables. Based on 1996 species with significant non-random habitat preferences, we identify four important aspects of plant species distribution in Yunnan: (1) species diversity hotspots; (2) seven major floristic regions, using a cluster analysis of species presence/absence; (3) priority areas for conservation based on the concept of the 'irreplaceability' value of planning units and (4) the percentage remaining natural forest among the species rich and conservation priority areas, to assess the level of endangerment.

The Severnaya Zemlya archipelago is host to many glaciers of which four major ice caps encompassing these glaciers are studied, namely, Academy of Sciences, Rusanov, Karpinsky, and University. In this study, we adopted the differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) method utilizing ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 datasets, with a temporal resolution of 14 days. The observed maximum velocity for one of the marine-terminating glaciers in the Academy of Sciences Ice Cap was 72.24 cm/day (approximate to 263 m/a). For the same glacier, an increment of 3.75 times the flow rate was observed in 23 years, compared to a previous study. This has been attributed to deformation in the bed topography of the glacier. Glaciers in other ice caps showed a comparatively lower surface velocity, ranging from 7.43 to 32.12 cm/day. For estimating the error value in velocity, we selected three ice-free regions and calculated the average value of their observed movement rates by considering the fact that there is zero movement for ice-free areas. The average value observed for the ice-free area was 0.09 cm/day, and we added this value in our uncertainty analysis. Further, it was observed that marine-terminating glaciers have a higher velocity than land-terminating glaciers. Such important observations were identified in this research, which are expected to facilitate future glacier velocity studies.","[Nela, Bala Raju; Bandyopadhyay, Debmita; Singh, Gulab] Indian Inst Technol, Centrer Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Glazovsky, Andrey F.; Lavrentiev, Ivan I.; Kromova, Tatiana E.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geog, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Arigony-Neto, Jorge] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Inst Oceanog, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, Brazil",,"Singh, G (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Centrer Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",balaraju@iitb.ac.in; debmitab@iitb.ac.in; gulab.singh@iitb.ac.in; glazovsky@igras.ru; ilavrentiev@gmail.com; tkhromova@gmail.com; jorgearigony@furg.br,,,,,,,,11.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2019,11.0,12,,,,,,,2466,10.3390/w11122466,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11122466,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000507378600039,View Full Record in Web of Science

Elevated concentrations of arsenic (> 50 A mu g/L) in the Middle Ganga Plain (MGP) are spatially related with dark grey to black coloured organic-rich clay sediments found both in the Active (AFP, T-0-surface) and Older Floodplains (OFP, T-1-surface) of the Ganga River. The floodplains comprise Newer Alluvium of Holocene age, mainly derived from Himalaya. Abandoned/palaeochannel cut-offs, either filled (often in OFP) or in the process of filling under fluvio-lacustrine environments (often in AFP) host such clay deposits. The settlements on anthropogenic fills (to avoid flood inundation) over such palaeochannels exhibit higher concentrations of arsenic in groundwater (max. 987 A mu g/L). The organic carbon from the clay bodies when released to groundwater promotes reducing environment that causes release of arsenic entrapped in the sediments. The sandy areas, such as scroll bar ridges, levees and point bar platforms, exhibit low concentrations of arsenic. The model on groundwater arsenic distribution and Holocene geomorphic units can be used for micro-level delineation of arsenic-free shallow aquifers for rural water supply in the arsenic-contaminated areas.","[Sahu, Sudarsan; Saha, Dipankar] MER, Cent Ground Water Board, Patna, Bihar, India",,"Sahu, S (corresponding author), MER, Cent Ground Water Board, Patna, Bihar, India.",sudarsan_cgwb@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,,22.0,24.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2015,73.0,7,,,,,3523,3536,,10.1007/s12665-014-3637-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-014-3637-3,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000351163300038,View Full Record in Web of Science

The species selected include Bambusa balcooa, Bambusa bambos, Bambusa vulgaris., Bambusa nutans, Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, Dendrocalamus stocksii, and Dendrocalamus strictus. Throughfall versus gross rainfall (GR) relationship in different species indicated high throughfall production during high rainfall events with r(2) > 0.90. Average throughfall was lowest (62.1%) in D. hamiltonii and highest in B. vulgaris (74.6%). SF ranged from 1.32% in B. nutans to 3.39% in D. hamiltonii. The correlation coefficient (r) between leaf area index (LAI), number of culms, and crown area with the interception were 0.746, 0.691, and 0.585, respectively.

The soil and water resources are becoming the major constraints in agricultural production in the erosion-prone fragile ecosystem of the region. However, due to intensive rains and sloping lands of the region, erosion of the topsoil becoming the major problem for practicing sustainable agriculture in the region, which further dissects the lands, reduces the fertility potentials and land productivities of the region. The root cause of this huge erosion in the region is the intensive rains within a short interval of time on the bare sloping hillsides and handling this problem in both ways could reduce their erosion damage. Socio-economically the farmers are illiterate, poor, and hesitate to adopt innovative techniques of both land and water conservation. All this makes the challenge of reducing erosion losses quite difficult. Farmers in the region do have the skills to manage the problem of soil erosion which they learned from their forefathers and have faith in them. These technologies put together are termed as Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITKs) and these ITKs have helped them a lot for sustainable agriculture in the region.

Appropriate monitoring is a big challenge to make sustainable growth by maintaining it for society. In recent times, water monitoring has turned into a smart monitoring system for water pollution (SMS-wp), with the advances on the Internet of things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and the improvement in current sensors. River Ganga is one of the major sources of water for drinking, irrigation, and industries in the northern part of India. Day by day, Ganga River is getting polluted, due to anthropogenic activities, such as the construction of dams, extensive use of fertilizers in agriculture, and untreated discharges from industries. Contamination in the river water is adversely affecting human health and river biota. Therefore, to improve the river ecosystem and to check infections and diseases, water quality assessment is very much important. The main aim of this study is to determine the Water Quality Index (WQI) of the River Ganges at the upper part of the Indo-Gangetic plain, just downstream of the Himalayan foothill using the last 3 years of data (2017-2019). Trend analysis for River Ganga water at considered locations is also a part of this study. Trend analysis is presenting the water quality of river Ganga in the coming years up to 2025. Twelve physicochemical parameters (TDS, chlorides, alkalinity, DO, temperature, COD, BOD, pH, magnesium, hardness, total coliform, and calcium) were analyzed to determine the water quality of River Ganga. As a result, WQI for next 5 years (from 2020 to 2025) is forecasted as an increment of 17.34% at Haridwar, 4.16% at Roorkee, and 21.63% at Dehradun. Results of the study indicated that WQI values just downstream of the Himalayan foothills in the upper reaches of the Gangetic plain are increasing every year. The authors have concentrated on how the advances in sensor innovation, the Internet of things, and machine learning techniques make water pollution monitoring a genuinely brilliant checking framework.

The cormextract is used for the treatment of rheumatism, gout, Behcet's syndrome, and Alzheimer disease. It is also used extensively in plant breeding programs for the doubling of chromosomes. The present study was carried out for two years (2017-2019) to study the genetic diversity of C. luteum, an economically important and endangered medicinal plant of Kashmir Himalaya. The mapping of genetic diversity of C. luteum was estimated using Mahalanobis D-2 analysis in the Aharbal (Kulgam), Dhara (Theed), and Baera Baal Hills (Harwan) of Kashmir Valley. The results showed the presence of 5 clusters for 30 populations. Therewere 17 populations in cluster-1, 1 in cluster-2, 2 in cluster-3, 3 in cluster-4, and 7 in cluster-5. The majority of the population was a group in cluster-1 followed by cluster-5. Themaximumintracluster distance (D-2 values) was observed in cluster-5 (46.55588) followed by cluster-3 (41.61871), and the maximum inter-cluster distance (D-2 values) was observed in cluster-3 (46.55588) followed by cluster-5 (41.61871). Our study revealed that plant species possessed sufficient genetic diversity among the populations. Cluster-5 showed superiority in plant(-1) respect of themaximum mean plant height (28.46 cm), leaf area (47.0 cm(2)), number of seeds plant(-1) (26.85), corm length (5.15 cm), corm width (3.17 cm), fresh weight of corm plant (6.87 g), and dry weight of corm plant (4.81 g) as compared to other clusters. Out of five clusters, cluster-5 is a promising one for better yield and yield attributing traits. The present study revealed that plant species possessed sufficient genetic diversity among the populations as 30 populations were arranged into 5 clusters. Therefore, cluster-5, consisting of seven populations fromthe undisturbed area of Harwan, and consequently the populations fromthe same cluster can bemultiplied for initiating a conservation and breeding programand can serve as a tool for the scientific community to evolve better contemporary varieties of C. luteum with profitable characters such as more yield of corms, etc. This will assist farmers, particularly the marginal farmers, to alleviate their income.","[Rather, Rauoof Ahmad; Bano, Haleema] Sher E Kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol, Div Environm Sci, Srinagar 190025, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Firoz, Ahmad; Ali, Hani Mohammed; Hakeem, Khalid Rehman] King Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Fac Sci, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [Bhat, M.

The results report that soil organic carbon (SOC) was adversely and bulk density favourably related with elevation. Moreover, SOC as CO(2)eq also decreased significantly with an increase in soil depths. Biomass carbon for various parts of the plant was also estimated for the three elevations of the Cedrus deodara forests. The trend in total carbon stock (bole, branch, twig, foliage and soil) decreased significantly with an increase in altitude. The carbon stock of Cedrus deodara forests was maximum (545 t ha(-1)) at upper altitude (2350 m.a.s.l) and minimum (330 t ha(-1)) at a lower altitude (2050 m.a.s.l).

India, a fast-globalizing country, faces a high risk of biological invasions. However, research and policy efforts on biological invasions in India are presently inadequate. Objectives: To propose an integrated research framework and policy agenda on biological invasions for India. Methods: The framework and agenda, drawn from research insights gained from plant invasion studies in the Kashmir Himalaya (India), adopts a stage-based model for characterization of invasive alien biota in India. Results: The research framework explicates crucial information on the origin, purpose and pathway of introduction, residence time, species invasiveness, invasiveness elsewhere, habitat invasibility, latitudinal and altitudinal ranges and ecological and economic impacts of invasive species. The policy agenda highlights an urgent need for regulation of introduction pathways, prioritization of the worst invasive species, shifting from species- to biota-centric approaches, looking beyond political borders, forging interdisciplinary collaboration, launching a national network, and generating public awareness. Conclusions: Adoption of such an integrated framework and agenda in India, and in other developing countries, can significantly fill the geographical knowledge gaps in invasion biology research which is crucial in winning the global battle against harmful biological invasions.

LULCC was quantified using Markov analysis, and the associated probability of change for each class was predicted. Landscape metrics were also used to quantify the spatial and temporal changes in the area.

In general, the water of the Yarlung Tsangpo had a fairly high buffering capacity (pH similar to 8.8) and oxidation environment (ORP similar to 190 mv). Total dissolved solids averaged approximately 157 mg L-1, which is higher than that of the global mean level. Under the dominant rock weathering due to the abundant carbonates around the river basin, the ionic chemistry of the Yarlung Tsangpo was mainly composed of Ca2+ and HCO3-.

Although watercourses on the Tibetan Plateau can generally be considered pristine, concentrations of some toxic elements (i.e., Cd and Pb) were found to be higher than the WHO guideline for drinking water due to increasing influence from anthropogenic activities (e.g., tourism, mining operations and municipal wastewater discharge), which constitute a risk to human livelihoods in both local and surrounding regions.","[Qu, Bin; Sillanpaa, Mika] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Lab Green Chem, Mikkeli 50130, Finland; [Zhang, Yulan; Kang, Shichang] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, State Key Lab Cryspher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Kang, Shichang] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Qu, B (corresponding author), Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Lab Green Chem, Mikkeli 50130, Finland.",bin.b.qu@lut.fi; yulan.zhang@lzb.ac.cn; shichang.kang@lzb.ac.cn; mika.sillanpaa@lut.fi,,,,,,,,45.0,47.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2017,76.0,2,,,,,,,74,10.1007/s12665-017-6393-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-6393-3,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000393021400016,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Raje, D; Krishnan, R",,,,"Raje, D.; Krishnan, R.",,,Bayesian parameter uncertainty modeling in a macroscale hydrologic model and its impact on Indian river basin hydrology under climate change,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Macroscale hydrologic models (MHMs) were developed to study changes in land surface hydrology due to changing climate over large domains, such as continents or large river basins. However, there are many sources of uncertainty introduced in MHM hydrological simulation, such as model structure error, ineffective model parameters, and low-accuracy model input or validation data. It is hence important to model the uncertainty arising in projection results from an MHM. The objective of this study is to present a Bayesian statistical inference framework for parameter uncertainty modeling of a macroscale hydrologic model. The Bayesian approach implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is used in this study to model uncertainty arising from calibration parameters of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) MHM. The study examines large-scale hydrologic impacts for Indian river basins and changes in discharges for three major river basins with distinct climatic and geographic characteristics, under climate change. Observed/reanalysis meteorological variables such as precipitation, temperature and wind speed are used to drive the VIC macroscale hydrologic model. An objective function describing the fit between observed and simulated discharges at four stations is used to compute the likelihood of the parameters. An MCMC approach using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to update probability distributions of the parameters. For future hydrologic simulations, bias-corrected GCM projections of climatic variables are used. The posterior distributions of VIC parameters are used for projection of 5th and 95th percentile discharge statistics at four stations, namely, Farakka, Jamtara, Garudeshwar, and Vijayawada for an ensemble of three GCMs and three scenarios, for two time slices. Spatial differences in uncertainty projections of runoff and evapotranspiration for years 2056-2065 for the a1b scenario at the 5th and 95th percentile levels are also projected. Results from the study show increased mean monthly discharges for Farakka and Vijayawada stations, and increased low, mid and high duration flows at Farakka, Jamtara and Vijayawada for the future. However, it is seen that uncertainty introduced due to choice of GCM, is larger than that due to parameter uncertainty for the VIC MHM. The largest effects of runoff predictive uncertainty due to uncertainty in VIC parameters are seen in the Himalayan foothills belt, and the high-precipitation Northeast region of the country. It is demonstrated through the study that it is relevant and feasible to provide Bayesian uncertainty estimates for macroscale models in projection of large-scale and regional hydrologic impacts.","[Raje, D.] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Krishnan, R.] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Ctr Climate Change Res, Pune, Maharashtra, India",,"Raje, D (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",draje@civil.iitb.ac.in,,,,,,,,46.0,50.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 28,2012,48.0,,,,,,,,W08522,10.1029/2011WR011123,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011WR011123,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000308311000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Metals cadmium (Cd), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), and chromium (Cr) were analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). Differences in the heavy metal accumulation were observed between the two species as well as between different sizes of the same species. Small size fishes exhibited more concentration of heavy metals than the larger size fishes of the same species. Heavy metals were found in the ranking order of Zn>Cr>Pb>Cu>Mn>Cd in both species of fishes and in both sizes as well. Zn, being the most concentrated metal found in both species, can pose a threat in the near future. Since both species are edible and constitute an essential part of human diet, the heavy metals assessed can be bioaccumulated in humans when consumed; hence, an extensive investigation is needed to evaluate the heavy metal concentration of other edible fishes of the Dal Lake in the future. The study will also be helpful in providing baseline data on the heavy metal accumulation of edible fish species in freshwater ecosystems.","[Rather, Mohd Yousuf; Dey, Arpita] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry, India; [Tilwani, Younus Mohd] Pondicherry Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Pondicherry, India",,"Rather, MY (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry, India.",yousufbashir786@gmail.com,,,,,,,,15.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2019,191.0,4,,,,,,,242,10.1007/s10661-019-7382-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7382-7,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000462456700004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Michael",,,Simulating the hydrological regime of the snow fed and glaciarised Gilgit Basin in the Upper Indus using global precipitation products and a data parsimonious precipitation-runoff model,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"In many high altitude river basins, the hydro-climatic regimes and the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation are little known, complicating efforts to quantify current and future water availability. Scarce, or non-existent, gauged observations at high altitudes coupled with complex weather systems and orographic effects further prevent a realistic and comprehensive assessment of precipitation. Quantifying the contribution from seasonal snow and glacier melt to the river runoff for a high altitude, melt dependent region is especially difficult. Global scale precipitation products, in combination with precipitation-runoff modelling may provide insights to the hydro-climatic regimes for such data scarce regions. In this study two global precipitation products; the high resolution (0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees), newly developed ERA5-Land, and a coarser resolution (0.55 degrees x 0.55 degrees) JRA-55, are used to simulate snow/glacier melts and runoff for the Gilgit Basin, a sub-basin of the Indus. A hydrological precipitation-runoff model, the Distance Distribution Dynamics (DDD), requires minimum input data and was developed for snow dominated catchments. The mean of total annual precipitation from 1995 to 2010 data was estimated at 888 mm and 951 mm by ERA5-Land and JRA-55, respectively. The daily runoff simulation obtained a Kling Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.78 and 0.72 with ERA5-Land and JRA-55 based simulations, respectively. The simulated snow cover area (SCA) was validated using MODIS SCA and the results are quite promising on daily, monthly and annual scales. Our result showed an overall contribution to the river flow as about 26% from rainfall, 37-38% from snow melt, 31% from glacier melt and 5% from soil moisture. These melt simulations are in good agreement with the overall hydro-climatic regimes and seasonality of the area. The proxy energy balance approach in the DDD model, used to estimate snow melt and evapotranspiration, showed robust behaviour and potential for being employed in data poor basins.

Conformal-Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) data for the periods 1976-2005, 2006-2035, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100 with RCP4.5 and RCP8.5; and Regional Climate Model (RegCM) data for the periods of 2041-2050 and 2071-2080 with RCP8.5 are used for climatic projection and, after bias correction, the same data are used as an input to the University of British Columbia (UBC) hydrological model for river flow projections. The projections of all of the future periods were compared with the results of 1976-2005 and with each other. Projections of future changes show a consistent increase in air temperature and precipitation. However, temperature and precipitation increase is relatively slow during 2071-2100 in contrast with 2041-2070. Northern parts are more likely to experience an increase in precipitation and temperature in comparison to the southern parts. A higher increase in temperature is projected during spring and winter over southern parts and during summer over northern parts. Moreover, the increase in minimum temperature is larger in both scenarios for all future periods. Future river flow is projected by both models to increase in the twenty first century (CCAM and RegCM) in both scenarios. However, the rate of increase is larger during the first half while it is relatively small in the second half of the twenty first century in RCP4.5. The possible reason for high river flow during the first half of the twenty first century is the large increase in temperature, which may cause faster melting of snow, while in the last half of the century there is a decreasing trend in river flow, precipitation, and temperature (2071-2100) in comparison to 2041-2070 for RCP4.5. Generally, for all future periods, the percentage of increased river flow is larger in winter than in summer, while quantitatively large river flow was projected, particularly during the summer monsoon. Due to high river flow and increase in precipitation in UIB, water availability is likely to be increased in the twenty first century and this may sustain water demands.","[Ali, Shaukat; Dan Li; Fu Congbin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, START Temperate East Asia Reg Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Ali, Shaukat; Dan Li; Fu Congbin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Key Lab Reg Climate Environm Temperate East Asia, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Khan, Firdos] Alpen Adria Univ, Inst Stat, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria; [Ali, Shaukat] Minist Climate Change, Global Change Impact Studies Ctr, Islamabad, Pakistan",,"Ali, S (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, START Temperate East Asia Reg Ctr, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",pirshauki@gamil.com; danli@tea.ac.cn,,,,,,,,102.0,104.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2015,10.0,1,,,,,,,14007,10.1088/1748-9326/10/1/014007,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/10/1/014007,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000348501800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sediments may serve as both the source and sink of heavy metals (HM). The Astore River basin is located in the Himalayas, northern Pakistan. The area is frequented by a high number of tourists and is characterized by a fragile biophysical system. This study aimed to assess the occurrence, spatial patterns, and potential sources of HM in the sediments of the Astore River network.MethodsThirty-nine samples from the Astore River and its tributaries were collected and analyzed for nine HM (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Cu, Co, Pb, and Ni) using atomic absorption spectrometry. Various modified indices, i.e., modified ecological risk index (mERI) and modified sediments pollution index (mSPI), were utilized to assess the sediment ecological and pollution risks. The data were subjected to compositional data analysis (Coda) using the R program for the source characterization of HM.ResultsThe results indicated that among the HM, Fe and Cd had the highest and lowest concentrations, respectively. Mn contributed the most to the pollution of the sediments, while Cd has the highest potential ecological impact. The mSPI indicated that the sediments were either in their natural state or showed low to moderate contamination, while only 2.5% were classified as extremely polluted. At the same time, 12.8% of the samples were categorized in the high pollution class. The ecological risk, however, showed more profound and negative bearings on the sediment quality as 33.3% and 2.5% of the samples showed considerable to high ecological risks. The spatial distribution of HM and the modified indices indicated Deosai valley as the zone of concern for management and abatement options.ConclusionOverall, this study concluded that the major contribution to HM concentration in the area was from natural sources. However, in the case of Cd and Zn, an amplification in concentration due to anthropic factors was noted. Mn and Cd stood out as the major contaminants posing profound ecological risks. A differential spatial pattern of HM contamination in valleys suggested the need for targeted and specific management plans for prevention.","[Ali, Wajid; Muhammad, Said] Univ Peshawar, Natl Ctr Excellence Geol, Peshawar 25130, Pakistan",,"Muhammad, S (corresponding author), Univ Peshawar, Natl Ctr Excellence Geol, Peshawar 25130, Pakistan.",saidmuhammad1@gmail.com,,,,,,,,14.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2023,23.0,5,,,,,2244,2257,,10.1007/s11368-023-03484-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-023-03484-0,,MAR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000946841800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, using high-spatial resolution As field-observations (similar to 3 million groundwater sources) across India, we have delineated the regional-scale occurrence of elevated groundwater As (>= 10 mu g/L), along with the possible geologic-geomorphologic-hydrologic and human-sourced predictors that influence the spatial distribution of the contaminant. Using statistical and machine learning method, we also modeled the groundwater As concentrations probability at 1 Km resolution, along with probabilistic delineation of high As-hazard zones across India. The observed occurrence of groundwater As was found to be most strongly influenced by geology-tectonics, groundwater-fed irrigated area (%) and elevation. Pervasive As contamination is observed in major parts of the Himalayan mega-river Indus-Ganges-Brahmaputra basins, however it also occurs in several more-localized pockets, mostly related to ancient tectonic zones, igneous provinces, aquifers in modern delta and chalcophile mineralized regions. The model results suggest As-hazard potential in yet-undetected areas. Our model performed well in predicting groundwater arsenic, with accuracy: 82% and 84%; area under the curve (AUC): 0.89 and 0.88 for test data and validation datasets. An estimated similar to 90 million people across India are found to be exposed to high groundwater As from field-observed data, with the five states with highest hazard are West Bengal (28 million), Bihar (21 million), Uttar Pradesh (15 million), Assam(8.6 million) and Punjab (6 million). However it can be much more if the modeled hazard is considered (>250 million). Thus, our study provides a detailed, quantitative assessment of high groundwater As across India, with delineation of possible intrinsic influences and exogenous forcings. The predictive model is helpful in predicting As-hazard zones in the areas with limited measurements. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Candidate metrics were analyzed for efficiency to discriminate degraded sites from non-degraded and redundancy analysis, which sorted 71% of omnivore individuals (excluding intolerant species), 40% of intolerant individuals, 44% of herbivore individuals (excluding benthic species), abundance and 44.5% of non-native individuals as potential metrics.

The GCMs data is obtained from the 5th Phase of Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Based on the five best performing GCMs, we note that global 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C warming thresholds are projected in 2026 and 2047 under RCP4.5 and 2022 and 3036 under RCP8.5 respectively while these thresholds are reached much earlier over Pakistan i.e. 2016 and 2030 under RCP4.5 and 2012 and 2025 under RCP8.5 respectively. Interestingly, the GCMs with the earliest emergence at the global scale are not necessarily the ones with the earliest emergence over Pakistan, highlighting spatial non-linearity in GCMs response. The emergence of 2.0 degrees C warming at global scale across 5 GCMs ranges from 2031 (CCSM4) to 2049 (NorESM) under RCP8.5. Precipitation generally exhibits a progressive increasing trend with stronger changes at higher warming or radiative forcing levels. Hydrological simulations representing the historical, 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C global and region warming time horizons indicate a robust but seasonally varying increase in the inflows. The highest inflows in the baseline and future are witnessed in July. However, the highest future increase in inflows is projected in October under RCP4.5 (37.99% and 65.11% at 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C) and in April under RCP8.5 (37% and 62.05% at 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C). These hydrological changes are driven by increases in the snow and glacial melt contribution, which are more pronounced at 2.0 degrees C warming level.

Evaluation and assessment of physicochemical variables of Marusudar River, Chenab valley, and Northwestern Himalayas, India are very important due to the plan for exploiting this river for hydropower generation. In this study, the physicochemical variables were taken from 15 sampling locations spread over the entire river basin (winter 2014, summer, and autumn 2015) were investigated. The results of the study indicate that the datasets obtained are clusterable, and the whole river basin can be categorized in two recognizable clusters with different water quality identified by Hopkin's statistics, hierarchical cluster analysis, and subsequently validated by the silhouette coefficient measures. Correlation and regression tests showed that water quality variables bear significant positive and negative relationships and significantly explain the significant proportion of variations produced in the dependent variables predictable from the independent variables. The results of Wilks' statistics corroborate with the principal component analysis of the entire river and cluster-wise dataset, showing the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors as drivers of the overall water quality in the Marusudar River. The water quality of the cluster 2 sites displayed the impact of anthropogenic activities. Furthermore, pH, total dissolved solids, and total hardness were the main and effective contributors to water quality index evaluation and determination. Gibbs and Piper's analysis indicated the rock-water dominance with calcium-bicarbonate hydrochemical facies in the river basin.","[Bhat, Sami Ullah; Jehangir, Arshid; Hamid, Aadil; Sabha, Inam; Qayoom, Umara] Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Bhat, Aftab Ahmad] Govt Degree Coll Beerwah, Dept Environm Sci, Budgam 193411, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Bhat, SU (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",samiullahbhat11@gmail.com,,,,,,,,15.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,232.0,11,,,,,,,449,10.1007/s11270-021-05394-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05394-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000711421600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the inception of geostationary satellites carrying advanced multispectral imagers of high temporal resolution, such as Japan's geostationary weather satellite Himawari-8, considerable progress can now be made towards spatially-complete estimation of daily snow-covered area. We developed a dynamic snow index (normalized difference snow index for vegetation-free background and normalized difference forest-snow index for vegetation background) fractional snow cover estimation method using Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) observations of the Tibetan Plateau. This method estimates fractional snow cover with the pixel-by-pixel linear relationship of snow index observations acquired under snow-free and snow-covered conditions. To achieve reliable snow-covered area mapping with minimal cloud contamination, the daily fractional snow cover can be represented as the composite of the high temporal resolution fractional snow cover estimates during daytime. The comparison against reference fractional snow cover data from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the Himawari-8 AHI fractional snow cover ranged from 0.07 to 0.16, and that the coefficient of determination (R-2) reached 0.81-0.96. Results from the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 winters indicated that the daily composite of Himawari-8 observations obtained a 14% cloud percentage over the Tibetan Plateau, which was less than the cloud percentage (27%) from the combination of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra and Aqua.","[Wang, Gongxue; Jiang, Lingmei; Liu, Xiaojing; Yang, Jianwei; Cui, Huizhen] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gongxue; Jiang, Lingmei; Liu, Xiaojing; Yang, Jianwei; Cui, Huizhen] Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Chinese Acad Sci, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jiancheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100010, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, LM (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Jiang, LM (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Chinese Acad Sci, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",wanggx@mail.bnu.edu.cn; jiang@bnu.edu.cn; shijc@radi.ac.cn; lxjing@mail.bnu.edu.cn; yangjianwei@mail.bnu.edu.cn; cuihz@mail.bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,9.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2019,11.0,20,,,,,,,2391,10.3390/rs11202391,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11202391,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000498395800059,View Full Record in Web of Science

Mechanistic modeling approaches incorporating cryospheric, hydrological, and vegetation processes in high spatial, temporal, and physical detail have never been applied for high-elevation catchments of HMA. We use a land surface model at high spatial and temporal resolution (100 m and hourly) to simulate the coupled dynamics of energy, water, and vegetation for the 350 km2 Langtang catchment (Nepal). We compare our model outputs for one hydrological year against a large set of observations to gain insight into the partitioning of the water balance at the subseasonal scale and across elevation bands. During the simulated hydrological year, we find that evapotranspiration is a key component of the total water balance, as it causes about the equivalent of 20% of all the available precipitation or 154% of the water production from glacier melt in the basin to return directly to the atmosphere. The depletion of the cryospheric water budget is dominated by snow melt, but at high elevations is primarily dictated by snow and ice sublimation. Snow sublimation is the dominant vapor flux (49%) at the catchment scale, accounting for the equivalent of 11% of snowfall, 17% of snowmelt, and 75% of ice melt, respectively. We conclude that simulations should consider sublimation and other evaporative fluxes explicitly, as otherwise water balance estimates can be ill-quantified.","[Buri, Pascal; Shaw, Thomas E.; Miles, Evan S.; Mccarthy, Michael J.; Fugger, Stefan; Ren, Shaoting; Kneib, Marin; Jouberton, Achille; Pellicciotti, Francesca] Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Fatichi, Simone] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, Singapore; [Fyffe, Catriona L.] Northumbria Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne, England; [Fyffe, Catriona L.; Pellicciotti, Francesca] Inst Sci & Technol Austria ISTA, Klosterneuburg, Austria; [Fugger, Stefan; Kneib, Marin; Jouberton, Achille] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Ren, Shaoting] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Steiner, Jakob] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Steiner, Jakob] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Geog & Reg Sci, Graz, Austria; [Fujita, Koji] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Japan",,"Buri, P (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Forest Snow & Landscape Res WSL, Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",pascal.buri@wsl.ch,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2023,59.0,10,,,,,,,e2022WR033841,10.1029/2022WR033841,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022WR033841,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001091989600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the basin, minimum, maximum, and average temperatures are showing a significant increasing trend in all the four seasons. Precipitation is showing insignificant decrease over time in the basin. However, the proportion of snow is decreasing and correspondingly, the proportion of rains is increasing. The temperature projections also show increasing trends for the end of this century. The time-series analysis of the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) shows a depletion of the snow-cover in the region. Furthermore, during the past 51 years, the glacier area in the basin has decreased from 46.09 km(2) in 1962 to 33.43 km(2) in 2013, a depletion of 27.47%. As a result of glacier recession in the basin, the streamflow fed predominantly by snowmelt and glacier melt, is showing a statistically significant decline since the mid-1990s. The declining streamflows have potential to adversely affect agriculture, energy production, tourism, and even domestic water supplies. The Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) was tested for estimating the runoff from this glaciated basin on an operational basis. The average simulated runoff 11.94 m(3) s(-1) at the outlet is in concordance with the average measured runoff 13.51 m(3) s(-1) showing R-2 of 0.82.

An extreme example occurred on 7 February 2021, when a catastrophic mass flow descended from the Ronti glacier at Chamoli, Indian Himalaya, causing widespread devastation, with more than 200 people killed or missing, as well as severe damage to four hydropower projects. To disclose what happened to the Ronti glacier over the past several decades, here, we focused on glacier changes in the Dhauliganga catchment in Uttarakhand, India, over the past two decades. Another five glaciers in the catchment were also studied to map the regional detailed glacier changes. Our achievements are summarized as follows. (1) Based on Landsat images, we constructed two glacier inventories for the catchment in 2001 and 2020. We mapped nearly 413 debris-free glaciers in the catchment between 2001 and 2020 and analyzed the glacier area change at basin and altitude levels. (2) Debris-free glacier area decreased from 477.48 +/- 35.23 km(2) in 2001 to 418.52 +/- 36.18 km(2) in 2020, with a reduction of 58.95 km(2) or 12.35% over the past two decades. (3) The geodetic mass balance was -0.27 +/- 0.10 m w.e.a(-1), with a glacier mass change of -0.12 Gt. a(-1) from 2000 to 2013. Based on the surface elevation difference between the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) footprints (acquired from 2018 to 2021) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) DEM from 2000 to 2021, the average glacier geodetic mass balance was -0.22 +/- 0.005 m w.e.a(-1), and glacier mass change was -0.10 Gt a(-1). (4) Our results were cross verified by available published elevation difference datasets covering multiple temporal periods, where mass balance was by -0.22 +/- 0.002 m w.e.a(-1) from 1975 to 2000 and -0.28 +/- 0.0001 w.e.a(-1) from 2000 to 2020. (5) Glacier 1 and Glacier 2, the two largest glaciers in the catchment, experienced a decreasing melt rate from 2000 to 2020, while Glacier 3, Glacier 4, and Glacier 5 demonstrated an increasing melt rate. However, Glacier 6, also known as the collapsed Ronti glacier, had a negative mass balance of -0.04 m w.e.a(-1) from 2000 to 2005 and turned positive from 2005 onward with 0.06 m w.e.a(-1) from 2005 to 2010, 0.19 m w.e.a(-1) from 2010 to 2015, and 0.32 m w.e.a(-1) from 2015 to 2020. We postulate that the Ronti glacier collapsed solely because of the significant mass accumulation observed between 3700 to 5500 m a.s.l. Our study helps to understand the collapsed glacier's mass changes over the past two decades and highlights the necessity to monitor mass-gaining glaciers from space to forecast the risks of disasters.","[Ali, Nauman; Ye, Qinghua; Ji, Xinhui; Hu, Yafan; Zhu, Liping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ali, Nauman; Ji, Xinhui; Hu, Yafan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xueqin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ali, Arslan] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China",,"Ye, QH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yeqh@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2022,14.0,22,,,,,,,5692,10.3390/rs14225692,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14225692,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000887637700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A total of 42 samples were collected from West and North districts of Sikkim during the wet and dry seasons. The integrated approach applied in this study includes pollution evaluation indices and multivariate statistical analysis to evaluate the intensity and source of pollution. The average concentrations of trace elements in the wet season in the order of their concentration are U < As < Li < Cu < Ba < Mn < Al < Zn < Fe and in the dry season are As < U < Li < Cu < Mn < Ba < Zn < Al < Fe, respectively. The distribution map of pollution evaluation indices, total coliform bacteria (TC), thermotolerant coliforms (TTC), and Escherichia coli (E. coli) indicate a significant spatial and temporal variation. Further, it is observed that 100% and 67% of the water samples were contaminated with E. coli in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The multivariate statistical techniques suggest that geogenic sources and anthropogenic activities via the municipal sewage systems have assimilated various contaminants which account for the concentration of heavy metals. The current distribution level of TC, TTC, E. coli, and trace elements such as Al, Fe, and Zn is of environmental and health concern which requires attention. It indicates that the region's most dependable springs and stream water used for consumption are susceptible to contamination and therefore need treatment before consumption.","[Zimik, Horthing V.; Misra, Anil Kumar; Ranjan, Rakesh Kr.; Wanjari, Nishchal; Basnett, Smriti; Roy, Goshaidas; Rai, Anirudra; Sharma, Khushboo; Keshare, Manish Kumar; Dolui, Swapan] Sikkim Univ, DSTs Ctr Excellence Water Resources Cryosphere & C, Sch Phys Sci, Dept Geol, 6th Mile, Gangtok 737102, Sikkim, India; [Basnett, Smriti] Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore, India",,"Misra, AK (corresponding author), Sikkim Univ, DSTs Ctr Excellence Water Resources Cryosphere & C, Sch Phys Sci, Dept Geol, 6th Mile, Gangtok 737102, Sikkim, India.",zimikhaps@gmail.com; anilgeology@gmail.com; rkranjan@cus.ac.in; nwanjari@cus.ac.in; smritibasnett@iisc.ac.in; goshaidas.roy@gmail.com; anirudrai67@gmail.com; sharma.khushboo112@gmail.com; manishkeshari0657@gmail.com; swapandolui5656@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2024,26.0,3,,,,,7947,7972,,10.1007/s10668-023-03044-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-03044-z,,MAR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000941907700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Orchidaceae, which is one of the most diverse angiosperm families with over 30,000 species, is currently facing grave threats from habitat degradation, climate change, and a range of human-induced issues. However, the spatial patterns of orchid distribution and the factors influencing these patterns, both of which are crucial for developing successful orchid conservation plans, remain poorly understood. Here, using one of the most extensive distribution datasets of >500 orchid species in Nepal, we mapped the distribution of all, common, rare, epiphyte, and terrestrial species and identified important factors driving their patterns. We also assessed their protection gaps and identified key conservation regions. We discovered low spatial congruence between the diversity patterns of different groups, and the fundamental drivers underlying the richness pattern differed considerably. The key orchid conservation areas were primarily found in the mid-hills and highlands of central Nepal, with 62 % of these areas outside the protected area (PA) network. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering pollinator diversity and other climate factors when developing effective management plans to conserve orchids, as well as employing different strategies to conserve different life forms. A huge conservation gap in protecting orchids despite large PA coverage in Nepal indicates insufficiency of existing PA network in conserving plants.

Mapquesting the glaciers led to the discovery of concealed world of psychrophiles harboring in it. In the present study, the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and heavy metal resistance genes (MRGs) were evaluated through both the culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Samples were collected from two different glaciers, i.e., debris-covered glacier (Changme Khangpu) and debris-free glacier (Changme Khang). Functional metagenomics of both the glacier samples, provided evidence of presence of resistant genes against various antibiotic groups. Bacitracin resistant gene (bacA) was the predominant ARG in both the glaciers. MRGs in both the glacier samples were diversified as the genes detected were resistant against various heavy metals such as arsenic, tungsten, mercury, zinc, chromium, copper, cobalt, and iron. Unique MRGs identified from Changme Khangpu glacier were resistant to copper (cutA, cutE, cutC, cutF, cueR, copC, and copB) and chromium (yelf, ruvB, nfsA, chrR, and chrA) whereas, from Changme Khang glacier they showed resistance against cobalt (mgtA, dmef, corD, corC, corB, and cnrA), and iron (yefD, yefC, yefB, and yefA) heavy metals. ARGs aligned maximum identity with Gram-negative psychrotolerant bacteria. The cultured bacterial isolates showed tolerance to high concentrations of tested heavy metal solutions. Interestingly, some of the antibiotic resistant bacterial isolates also showed tolerance towards the higher concentrations of heavy metals. Thus, an introspection of the hypothesis of co-occurrence and/co-selection of ARGs and MRGs in such environments has been highlighted here.","[Sherpa, Mingma Thundu; Najar, Ishfaq Nabi; Das, Sayak; Thakur, Nagendra] Sikkim Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Microbiol, 6th Mile, Gangtok 737102, Sikkim, India",,"Thakur, N (corresponding author), Sikkim Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Microbiol, 6th Mile, Gangtok 737102, Sikkim, India.",mingmasherpa8@gmail.com; urooj.ishfaq@gmail.com; sayakdas2002@gmail.com; nthakur@cus.ac.in,,,,,,,,22.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 15,2020,203.0,,,,,,,,111037,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111037,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000630184100013,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we used a dated phylogeny including 95.70 % of the Chinese vascular genera and 1,540,695 species distribution records to identify ex situ conservation gaps in the tree of life and geographic space in China. We found that at least 41.70 % (12,716 species) of all vascular plant species (30,494 species), including 49.31 % (1715 species) of Chinese endangered species, are conserved in the botanic gardens. The results show that most species in ex situ collections are from eastern China and have been housed in botanic gardens in this region, whereas several plant diversity hotpots in the southwestern and northwestern regions are not well represented in ex situ conservation; only 12.67 % of the collection capacity of the Chinese botanic gardens is allocated to endangered species; there are 18 phylogenetic clusters of genera absent from the ex situ collections and the missing species are mostly from alpine or desert, mainly distributed in the Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains and northern Xinjiang. Therefore, we suggest that more collection capacity of China be devoted to endangered species particularly in the southwestern and northwestern regions. Our study provides quantified resources of targeted inventory and area for future ex situ conservation in China, and a fundamental protocol to invest the future achievement of local or global ex situ conservation.","[Ye, Jianfei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Ecol, Shenzhen Campus, Shenzhen 518107, Peoples R China; [Ye, Jianfei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, State Key Lab Biol Control, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Ye, Jianfei; Shan, Zhangjian; Peng, Danxiao; Niu, Yanting; Liu, Yun; Zhang, Qian; Lin, Qinwen; Wang, Yingwei; Chen, Zhiduan] China Natl Bot Garden, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Shan, Zhangjian; Peng, Danxiao; Liu, Yun; Zhang, Qian; Chen, Zhiduan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Shan, Zhangjian; Liu, Yun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Sun, Miao] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Hort & Forestry Sci, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yong] Nanjing Forestry Univ, Coll Biol & Environm, Nanjing 210037, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jin; Zhu, Renbin] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Key Lab Trop Forest Ecol, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Ye, Jianfei] 66 Gongchang Rd, Shenzhen 518107, Guangdong, Peoples R China",,"Ye, JF (corresponding author), 66 Gongchang Rd, Shenzhen 518107, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yejf9@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,1.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2023,282.0,,,,,,,,110044,10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110044,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110044,,APR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000976668200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Understanding local vegetation changes is crucial for projecting ecosystem dynamics. In this paper, we make a case for Himalayan mountain areas to explore vegetation dynamics and their influencing factors. Firstly, the interannual trends of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were extracted by the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) algorithm and linear regression method. Moreover, the influence of environmental factors on interannual NDVI trends was assessed using the Random Forests algorithm and partial dependence plots. Subsequently, the time-lag effects of seasonal NDVI on different climatic factors were discussed and the effects of these factors on seasonal NDVI changes were determined by partial correlation analysis. The results show that (1) an overall weak upward trend was observed in NDVI variations from 1982 to 2015, and 1989 is considered to be the breakpoint of the NDVI time series; (2) interannual temperature trends and the shortest distance to large lakes were the most important factors in explaining interannual NDVI trends. Temperature trends were positively correlated with NDVI trends. The relationship between the shortest distance to large lakes and the NDVI trend is an inverted U-shaped; (3) the time-lags of NDVI responses to four climatic factors were shorter in Autumn than that in Summer. The NDVI responds quickly to precipitation and downward long-wave radiation; (4) downward long-wave radiation was the main climate factor that influenced NDVI changes in Autumn and the growing season because of the warming effect at night. This study is important to improve the understanding of vegetation changes in mountainous regions.","[Ye, Zu-Xin; Zhao, Zhi-Qi; Guo, Jian-Yang; Ding, Hu] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Inst Geochem, Guiyang 550081, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zu-Xin; Cheng, Wei-Ming; Wang, Nan] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zu-Xin; Wang, Nan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Zhi-Qi] Changan Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",,"Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Inst Geochem, Guiyang 550081, Guizhou, Peoples R China.;Zhao, ZQ (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",yezuxin@mail.gyig.ac.cn; chengwm@lreis.ac.cn; zhaozhiqi@chd.edu.cn; guojianyang@vip.skleg.cn; Dinghu@vip.skleg.cn; wnan@lreis.ac.cn,,,,,,,,15.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1,2019,11.0,11,,,,,,,1392,10.3390/rs11111392,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11111392,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000472648000135,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study assesses the temporal trends of seasonal and annual runoff in the Chitral River Basin (CRB) and its responses to regional climatic factors (i.e., temperature, precipitation, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) and oceanic indices at large scales (i.e., El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)). The non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test, the Sequential Mann-Kendall test (SQMK) and Sen Slope (SS) is used to evaluate trends and magnitude. In contrast, wavelet analysis is used to assess the coherence. In general, precipitation increases in winter, summer and autumn, whereas it decreases in spring. The temperature increased significantly in winter and spring, while a significant increase in seasonal and annual runoff was evident. Annual NDVI increased, whereas the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) decreased. Generally, runoff has significant inter-annual coherences with regional environmental factors, and a significant coherence with NDVI. Monthly runoff has a positive coherence with temperature and NDVI, whereas it has a negative correlation with precipitation, NDWI, and NDSI. In general, ENSO, IOD and PDO show a positive correlation with runoff. The MWC findings indicate that annual runoff prevailed interannual signals with local environmental factors and with the Pacific Ocean, whereas interannual and interdecadal coherences are obvious with the Atlantic Ocean.

AFSs can sequester carbon and amend the organic matter, thereby enhancing the crop productivity. Carbon sequestration depends on the type of AFSs, climate, cropping pattern, and management practices. The aim of this study was to evaluate different AFSs for their potential to sequester carbon and impact on soil organic matter (SOM) in the eastern sub-Himalayas, India. Hedge-, alder-, and guava-based AFSs were established along with control (without any tree), and the maize-mustard-potato cropping pattern was followed in each AFS. Soil samples were collected after the fifth crop cycle and further analyzed. The results showed that crop productivity was significantly higher in all the AFSs than control. On average, soil organic carbon (SOC) was found to be significantly higher by 62 and 64% in hedge-based AFSs as compared to guava-based AFSs and control, respectively, and at par with alder-based AFSs. Particulate organic carbon (POC) was higher in all the three AFSs than in the control. For microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) contents, the trend of AFSs was expressed as alder-based AFS > hedge-based AFS > guava-based AFS > control. Hedge- and alder-based AFSs had higher SOC stocks than guava-based AFSs and control. Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2 eq.) emissions were greater in control than hedge-based AFSs (35.2 Mg ha(-1)), followed by alder-based AFSs (28.6 Mg ha(-1)), and the lowest was observed in guava-based AFSs. On an average, hedge species accumulated more nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), which were 60, 12, and 28 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. This conclusively proved that AFSs were significantly affecting SOM pools and crop productivity and had a significant role in carbon retention in the soil. Overall, hedge- and alder-based AFSs retained higher soil carbon, and hence, hedge- and alder-based AFSs may be promoted to achieve climate-smart agriculture practices in the acid soils of the Indian sub-Himalayan region.","[Parmar, Brajendra] ICAR Res Complex, Indian Inst Rice Res, Hyderabad, India; [Vishwakarma, Anand] ICAR Res Complex, Indian Inst Soil Sci, Bhopal, India; [Padbhushan, Rajeev; Kumar, Amarendra; Kumar, Rajkishore; Kumari, Ragini] Bihar Agr Univ, Bhagalpur, India; [Kumar Yadav, Brahmdeo] KVK, Latehar, India; [Giri, S.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the spatial changes in the availability and sustainability of water resources in Afghanistan. The Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) data of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite obtained from three different institutes, having 1 degrees x 1 degrees spatial resolution for the period 2002-2016 was used for this purpose. Sen's slope method was used to assess the rate of change, and the Modified Mann-Kendall test was used for the evaluation of the significance of trends in TWS. After, the concept of reliability-resiliency-vulnerability (RRV) was used for assessing the spatial distribution of sustainability in water resources. The results revealed a significant decrease in water availability in the country over the last 15 years. The decrease was found to be highest in the central region where most of the population of the country resides. The reliability in water resources was found high in the northeast Himalayan region and low in the southwest desert; resilience was found low in the central region, while vulnerability was found high in the south and the southeast. Overall, the water resources of the country were found most sustainable in the northeast and southwest and least in the south and the central parts. The maps of water resource sustainability and the changes in water availability produced in the present study can be used for long-term planning of water resources for adaptation to global changes. Besides, those can be used for the management of water resources in a sustainable and judicious manner.","[Sediqi, Mohammad Naser; Shiru, Mohammed Sanusi; Nashwan, Mohamed Salem; Ahmed, Kamal; Shahid, Shamsuddin; Manawi, Sayed Mir Agha] UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia; [Shiru, Mohammed Sanusi] Fed Univ Dutse, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, PMB 7156, Dutse, Nigeria; [Nashwan, Mohamed Salem] AASTMT, Fac Engn & Technol, Cairo 2033, Elhorria, Egypt; [Ali, Rawshan] Erbil Polytech Univ, Koya Tech Inst, Dept Petr, Erbil 44001, Kurdistan, Iraq; [Ali, Rawshan] China Three Gorges Univ, Coll Hydraul & Environm Engn, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China; [Abubaker, Shadan] Knowledge Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Environm Engn, Erbil 44001, Kurdistan, Iraq; [Wang, Xiaojun] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaojun] Minist Water Resources, Res Ctr Climate Change, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Asaduzzaman, Md.] Staffordshire Univ, Dept Engn & Design, Stoke On Trent ST4 2DE, Staffs, England",,"Shiru, MS (corresponding author), UTM, Fac Engn, Sch Civil Engn, Johor Baharu 81310, Malaysia.;Shiru, MS (corresponding author), Fed Univ Dutse, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, PMB 7156, Dutse, Nigeria.;Ali, R (corresponding author), Erbil Polytech Univ, Koya Tech Inst, Dept Petr, Erbil 44001, Kurdistan, Iraq.;Ali, R (corresponding author), China Three Gorges Univ, Coll Hydraul & Environm Engn, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China.",naser8928@gmail.com; shiru.sanusi@gmail.com; m.salem@aast.edu; rawshan.ali@epu.edu.iq; shadaneco@yahoo.com; xjwang@nhri.cn; kamal_brc@hotmail.com; sshahid@utm.my; md.asaduzzaman@staffs.ac.uk; tm124000@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,40.0,42.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 2,2019,11.0,20,,,,,,,5836,10.3390/su11205836,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11205836,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000498398900292,View Full Record in Web of Science

Large cardamom is a high-value, agro-climatically suitable, and non-perishable spice crop grown in the Himalayan region. Originating in Sikkim, the crop is important to the local economy and is sold in both domestic and international markets; however, its production in India has been declining significantly in recent years. Using VCA and participatory methods of data collection the study helped elicit value chain actors' perspectives on various reasons for the decline as well as potential strategies to improve the cardamom value chain. The results present the multiple environmental and climatic (e.g. water stress), social (e.g. women participation) and institutional (e.g. lack of trust between actors) challenges and corresponding upgrading strategies. Through participatory multi-criteria analysis (MCA), the strategies were prioritized based on the overall preferences of multiple stakeholders. The analysis considered eight criteria and 25 options, or strategies, and found that that marketability and profitability were the most important criteria, and increasing cardamom production, the most important option trait. Stakeholder discussions along with sensitivity analysis also showed how these options could be implemented and revealed how criteria preferences can change with expert inputs. This combination of VCA and MCA, because it supports participatory decision-making and balances multiple dimensions of sustainable development, can be effectively deployed in planning for agricultural development in the mountains.","[Sen, Sudeshna Maya; Kansal, Arun] TERI Sch Adv Studies, Coca Cola Dept Reg Water Studies, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India",,"Kansal, A (corresponding author), TERI Sch Adv Studies, Coca Cola Dept Reg Water Studies, 10 Inst Area, New Delhi 110070, India.",sudeshnamayasen@gmail.com; akansal37@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2019,16.0,10,,,,,2417,2434,,10.1007/s11629-019-5437-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-019-5437-4,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000489956000016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Atlas of Baseline Environmental Profiling along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) at five locations in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) is a major landmark in this regard due to the presence of massive glaciers in the region, which are considered as water reserves for the country. Using various statistical measurements, the air quality was analyzed at the studied geographic locations. Further, air quality was evaluated based on air pollutant data acquired from ambient air monitoring laboratories. For example, 24 h concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5) were found to range from 25.4 to 60.1 mu g/m(3), with peaks in the winter season at Gilgit. It was found that PM2.5 values were 1.7 and 1.3 times greater than National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) standards only at Gilgit and Chilas, respectively, and 1.5 to 4 times greater than the World Health Organization (WHO) standards at all locations. Similarly, PM2.5 concentrations were found to range from 31.4 to 63.9 mu g/m(3), peaking at Chilas in summer 2020. The observed values were 1.1 to 1.8 times and 2 to 4.2 times greater than the NEQS and WHO standards, respectively, at all locations. In addition, the average peaks of black carbon (BC) were measured at Gilgit, both in winter (16.21 mu g/m(3)) and summer (7.83 mu g/m(3)). These elevated levels could be attributed to the use of heavy diesel vehicles, various road activities and different meteorological conditions. Pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX) and ozone (O-3) were found to be within NEQS and WHO limits. Based on air quality metrics, the effect of PM2.5 on air quality was found to be moderate in Sost, Hunza and Jaglot, while it was at unhealthy levels at Gilgit and Chilas in the winter of 2019; moderate levels were observed at Sost while unhealthy levels were detected at the remaining locations in the summer of 2020. There are no specific guidelines for BC. However, it is associated with PM2.5, which was found to be a major pollutant at all locations. The concentrations of CO, SO2 and O-3 were found to be at safe levels at all locations. The major fraction of air masses is received either locally or from transboundary emissions. This study demonstrates that PM2.5 and BC are the major and prevailing air pollutants within the study region, while other air pollutants were found to be within the permissible limits of the WHO and NEQS.","[Ahmad, Maqbool] Dept Elementary & Secondary Educ Khyber Pakhtunkhw, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Hussain, Khadim; Liaquat, Samreen; Hussain, Waqar; Ali, Ajaz] Gilgit Baltistan Environm Protect Agcy GB EPA, Gilgit 15100, Pakistan; [Nasir, Jawad; Bin Farhan, Suhaib] Pakistan Space & Upper Atmosphere Res Commiss SUPA, Off Univ Rd, Karachi 75270, Pakistan; [Huang, Zhongwei; Alam, Khan] Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Western Ecol Safety, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Alam, Khan] Univ Peshawar, Dept Phys, Peshawar 25120, Pakistan; [Wang, Peng] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Dept Comp & Math, Manchester M15 6BH, England; [Mihaylova, Lyudmila] Univ Sheffield, Dept Automat Control & Syst Engn, Sheffield S10 2TN, England",,"Alam, K (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Coll Atmospher Sci, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Western Ecol Safety, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.;Alam, K (corresponding author), Univ Peshawar, Dept Phys, Peshawar 25120, Pakistan.",ls_khan@lzu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2022,13.0,12,,,,,,,1994,10.3390/atmos13121994,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13121994,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000900271400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Total 164 samples of meltwater were collected in two times a day at 8.0 a.m and 6.0 p.m. Bicarbonate and calcium were the dominant anion and cation in meltwater of the investigation area. High ratios of (Ca + Mg) versus TZ(+) and (Ca + Mg) versus (Na + K) demonstrate that hydrogeochemistry of the study area was mainly governed by carbonate type weathering. The average sulphate mass fraction of meltwater was computed to be 0.31 +/- 0.12, showing dominancy of bicarbonate over sulphate. This excess bicarbonate would be generated by an alternative proton supply mechanism due to biological activities in the bed rock lithology and sulphide oxidation may be about the same as carbonation as a driver of chemical weathering at Chhota Shigri glacier. In general, major ions and total dissolved solid concentrations showed decreasing trend with increasing discharge from the study area. The average daily mean dissolved load of this glacier was much lower than that of the Gangotri glacier, which may be due to low meltwater runoff and lithology of the investigation area.

But there is still a void for a universal modeling approach for SDMs. With recent advancements in satellite data and machine learning algorithms, the prediction of species occurrence is more accurate and realistic. Presently, four machine learning and regression-based algorithms, namely, generalized linear model, maximum entropy, boosted regression tree, and random forest (RF) are used to model the geographical distribution of Rhododendron arboreum, which is economically and medicinally important species found in the fragile ecosystem of Himalayas. To establish complex relation between the occurrence data and regional climatic and land use parameters, several satellite products, namely, MODIS, Sentinel-5p, GPM, ECOSTRESS, and shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM), are acquired and used as predictor variables to the different SDM algorithms. The performance evaluation has been conducted using the area under curve (AUC), which showed the best result for Maxent (AUC = 0.871) and poor result was observed for RF (AUC = 0.755) among all. The overall prediction confirmed the distribution of Rhododendron arboreum in the mid to high altitudes of central and southern parts of the Garhwal Division.

Kenya in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Little Ice Age (LIA), and at present. Our results show that the areas of Lewis Glacier and the Tyndall-I glacier system were 0.678 km(2) and 0.390 km(2), respectively, during the maximum of LIA. Those mean that the both glaciers have shrunken by 87.0% and 88.7%, respectively since the LIA. Area change ratios for each glacier were significantly larger in the period of 2000 through 2015 than the former periods, indicating that glacier recession has accelerated. Continuous ice loss in this region has been driven by rising temperature and fluctuating precipitation.

The samples were analyzed for water-soluble dicarboxylic acids (C-2-C-12) and related compounds (ketocarboxylic acids and alpha-dicarbonyls), as well as organic carbon, elemental carbon and water soluble organic carbon. The contributions of total dicarboxylic acids to total aerosol carbon during wintertime were 1.7% and 1.8%, for day and night, respectively whereas they were significantly smaller during summer. Molecular distributions of diacids revealed that oxalic (C-2) acid was the most abundant species followed by succinic (C-4) and malonic (C-3) acids. The average concentrations of total diacids (433 +/- 108 ng m(-3)), ketoacids (48 +/- 23 ng m(-3)), and alpha-dicarbonyls (9 +/- 4 ng m(-3)) were similar to those from large Asian cities such as Tokyo, Beijing and Hong Kong. During summer most of the organic species were several times more abundant than in winter. Phthalic acid, which originates from oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as naphthalene, was found to be 7 times higher in summer than winter. This feature has not been reported before in atmospheric aerosols. Based on molecular distributions and air mass backward trajectories, we conclude that dicarboxylic acids and related compounds in Himalayan aerosols are derived from anthropogenic activities in the highly populated Indo-Gangetic plain areas.","[Hegde, P.; Kawamura, K.] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan; [Hegde, P.] Vikram Sarabhai Space Ctr, Space Phys Lab, Trivandrum 695022, Kerala, India",,"Hegde, P (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido 060, Japan.",hegdeprashant@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,65.0,72.0,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,12.0,14,,,,,6645,6665,,10.5194/acp-12-6645-2012,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-12-6645-2012,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000306808300037,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study researches the causes of deteriorating water quality in the Lidder River, one of the main tributaries of Jhelum River in Kashmir Himalaya. The land use and land cover of the Lidder catchment were generated using multi-spectral, bi-seasonal IRS LISS III (October 2005 and May 2006) satellite data to identify the extent of agriculture and horticulture lands that are the main non-point sources of pollution at the catchment scale. A total of 12 water quality parameters were analyzed over a period of 1 year. Water sampling was done at eight different sampling sites, each with a varied topography and distinct land use/land cover, along the length of Lidder River. It was observed that water quality deteriorated during the months of June-August that coincides with the peak tourist flow and maximal agricultural/horticultural activity. Total phosphorus, orthophosphate phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, and ammoniacal nitrogen showed higher concentration in the months of July and August, while the concentration of dissolved oxygen decreased in the same period, resulting in deterioration in water quality. Moreover, tourism influx in the Lidder Valley shows a drastic increase through the years, and particularly, the number of tourists visiting the valley has increased in the summer months from June to September, which is also responsible for deteriorating the water quality of Lidder River. In addition to this, the extensive use of fertilizers and pesticides in the agriculture and horticulture lands during the growing season (June-August) is also responsible for the deteriorating water quality of Lidder River.","[Rashid, Irfan; Romshoo, Shakil Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Romshoo, SA (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",shakilrom@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,78.0,80.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2013,185.0,6,,,,,4705,4719,,10.1007/s10661-012-2898-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-012-2898-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000318503100016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analysis carried out on 212 glaciers indicated decrease of 57 km(2) (8 %) of glacier area over many glacier which was partly compensated with area increase by 42 km(2) (6 %) in other glaciers, resulting an overall glacier area decrease by only 15 km(2) (2 %) from 1962-2001. Due to glacier fragmentation the number of glaciers increased from 212 in 1962 to 238 by 2001. Although majority of glaciers (88 %) exhibited retreat (up to 13 my(-1)), minor advancement (< 15 my(-1)) also took place in few glaciers during this period. Advancement took place mainly in larger glaciers (2-5 km(2) and > 5 km(2)) located over wider altitudinal range (700 m-1,000 m) whereas smaller glaciers (< 2 km(2)) with narrow altitudinal range (100 m-500 m) exhibited retreat. The supraglacial debris analysis indicated that percentage of debris cover over glaciers ranges from 1.43 % to 18.15 %. Smaller glaciers (< 2 km(2)) were debris free in comparison to the larger glaciers (> 5 km(2)). During 2001-2009 majority of the glaciers were apparently stable in terms of their area and snout position indicating less impact of climate forcing in parts of Zanskar valley as compared to other parts of the Himalaya.","[Ghosh, Swagata] Birla Inst Technol, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi 835215, Bihar, India; [Pandey, A.

The valley in the middle is drained by the Beas River and numerous tributaries join it laterally. The tributary channels have deposited large alluvial fans at their mouths which form three distinct levels. The Beas River has deposited alluvial terraces, which are very distinct towards the lower reaches and form three to four levels. The upper slopes and high altitudinal areas are covered with periglacial and glacial deposits. The terrace, fan and hill slopes have provided an ideal geoenvironment for human activities including agriculture, horticulture, dense settlements and other civil establishments. The Kullu Valley is prone to various natural hazards, flash floods and cloudbursts that are very common in this valley due to its peculiar geomorphic condition, high relief of peripheral ridges and impact of monsoon winds. The studies carried out so far indicate that the losses caused by these phenomena both in terms of life and property are mainly due to unwise human interaction with the geoenvironment of the area.

The present work was carried out for Gopi khola watershed, mountainous terrain in Nepal Himalaya as the watershed mainly relies upon the groundwater assets; it is a need to explore groundwater potential for better management of the aquifer framework. Ten groundwater influencing factors were collected such as elevation, slope, curvature, topographic positioning index, topographic roughness index, drainage density, topographic wetness index, geology, lineament density, and land use thematic layers. Among those influencing factors, topographic roughness index was removed because of multicollinearity issue to reduce the dimension of the dataset. A spring inventory map of 145 spring locations was prepared using field survey method and an equal number of spring absence points were randomly generated. The 70% of spring and spring absence pixels were used as training dataset and remaining as test dataset. The final map was created based on predicted probabilities ranging from 0 to 1. The validation was done using the receiver operating characteristic curve, which shows that the area under the curve is 76.1% for the training dataset and 82.1% for the test dataset. The sensitivity analysis was performed using Jackknife test which shows that the lineament density is the most important factor. The experimental results demonstrated that deep neural network is highly capable to capture groundwater potential zone in mountainous terrain.

Don) Soo (Orchidaceae) is a critically endangered high-value medicinal plant collected from wild and extensively used against diabetes, cuts/wound healing, gastric disorders, chronic fever, seminal weakness/dysfunctions, and bone fractures. The tuber of the species yields high quality Salep having astringent and aphrodisiac properties, with high economic value. This results in high demand and illegal collection of the species from wild, thus making this species one of the most exploited species in the Indian Himalaya. The populations of D. hatagirea are restricted to small isolated pockets and are subject to destructive harvesting, therefore, need urgent in situ as well as ex situ conservation interventions. In view of this, the present study is an attempt to understand population status, its distribution, threats, and vulnerability of the species. A total of 14 sites in different habitat types along the altitudinal gradient (2500-4500 m) were selected for intensive field study in the Indian Western Himalaya. The results of the study reveal that D. hatagirea prefers moist laden undulating habitats in alpine meadows. The population density of the species ranges between 0.70 and 2.43 individuals/m(2) in alpine meadows of the studied sites. Population density and species abundance increased significantly along the altitude within its range of occurrence. The relationship between altitude and total density was curvilinear and significant (r(2)=0.666, p<0.002), whereas non-linear and non-significant (r(2)=0.224, p>0.247) between slope and total density. The results of the study also indicate that the vegetation in alpine ecosystem were more diverse in species composition at mid-altitudes (3400 to 3700 m) than high altitudes. Destructive harvesting of underground tuber and irregular grazing were observed as critical threats to the species. D. hatagirea share habitats with few expanding species (i.e., Polygonum polystachyum) and highly traded species (i.e., Ophiocordyceps sinensis) in the alpine meadows, which affects its population density. The study concluded that short life cycle, poor seed germination rate, specific microhabitat requirement, low population density, and high commercial value limit the widespread distribution of the species in the region. The findings of the study suggest an urgent need for developing conservation and management plan for the species in the region for sustaining traditional health care system and pharmaceutical demand.","[Singh, Laxman; Bhatt, Indra D.; Negi, Vikram S.; Nandi, Shyamal K.; Rawal, Ranbeer S.] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Ctr Biodivers Conservat & Management, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India; [Bisht, Anil K.] Kumaun Univ, Dept Bot, DSB Campus, Naini Tal, Uttarakhand, India",,"Bhatt, ID (corresponding author), GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Ctr Biodivers Conservat & Management, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India.",id_bhatt@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,8.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2021,21.0,2,,,,,,,40,10.1007/s10113-021-01762-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-021-01762-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000640380700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study area includes the massive Puguang gas field and other nearby gas fields of considerable size. These carbonate reservoirs display significant heterogeneity, which is primarily influenced by the presence of natural fractures. Extensive documentation of fracture types, characteristics, effectiveness, and their role in enhancing reservoir properties was conducted by examining and analyzing various data sources, including cores, thin sections, image logs, and experimental measurements. Shear fractures primarily characterize the Feixianguan Formation carbonate reservoir, although tensile and diagenetic fractures are also present, albeit in fewer numbers. Tectonic fractures are the dominant type, particularly unfilled ones with dip angles greater than 60 degrees in the NEE-SWW direction. These fractures are mainly filled with calcite. The tectonic fractures were formed in three stages: Late Indosinian-Early Yanshanian, Late Yanshanian-Early Himalayan, and Late Himalayan. These fractures intersect with the in situ stress direction at a small angle in the NE-SW, NEE-SWW, and near E-W directions, contributing to their effectiveness. Compared with the total fracture density, the effective fracture density is the factor in controlling gas production. An increase in the proportion of effective fractures tends to result in a rise in gas productivity. Additionally, the orientation of effective fractures also influences natural gas production. Fractures striking in the E-W and NE-SW directions, which are particularly effective, are associated with high natural gas production.","[Guan, Cong; Zeng, Lianbo; Yao, Yingtao; Liang, Dong] China Univ Petr, Natl Key Lab Petr Resources & Engn, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Guan, Cong; Zeng, Lianbo; Yao, Yingtao; Liang, Dong] China Univ Petr, Coll Geosci, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hang; Zhang, Jiewei] PetroChina Southwest Oil & Gas Field Co, Northeastern Sichuan Oil & Gas Dist, Dazhou 635000, Peoples R China",,"Zeng, LB (corresponding author), China Univ Petr, Natl Key Lab Petr Resources & Engn, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.;Zeng, LB (corresponding author), China Univ Petr, Coll Geosci, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",conggcup@163.com; lbzeng@sina.com; 2020310032@student.cup.edu.cn; zhanghang@petrochina.com.cn; zhangjiewei@petrochina.com.cn; dong_liangg@163.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2023,15.0,23,,,,,,,16155,10.3390/su152316155,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152316155,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001116708700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Total use values, medicinal use values and other use values of plants were used for analyses. Plant availability was assessed by using phytosociological indicators. The accessibility was tested by using the use values of plants with reference to the site-specific explanatory variables: forest/non-forest habitat, nearby/transition/distant area, hill/mountainous district, and Himalayan endemic/Pan-Himalayan/cosmopolitan distribution. A weak association between plant use values and plant availability and site accessibility was recorded. However, the plant use value was influenced by ecological (Shannon diversity, species richness) and cultural indicators (preference for specific products and recognition) and varied at the level of use category (medicinal and non-medicinal). Higher medicinal use values at Darchula district indicate that the knowledge of plant collection and use was more dependent on quality of products and directed harvesting and less influenced by availability of resources and accessibility of sites.

The focus of this study was to develop a remodeled water quality index (WQI(min)) based on the localized trends in water quality and demonstrate it to understand water quality variations of Dal Lake (a freshwater lake in the Himalayan region). Spatio-temporal changes and trends of 14 water quality parameters were investigated that were arbitrated from the samples collected at 11 sampling locations during the water quality monitoring across the Dal Lake from September 2017 to August 2020. The results signify that the general mean WQI value was 81.9, and seasonal average WQI values ranges from 79.44 to 84.55. The water quality showed seasonal variance, with lowest values in summer, succeeded by autumn and winter, and highest in spring. Moreover, the results from stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the WQI(min) significantly correlates with six water quality parameters (ammonia, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, temperature, turbidity, and nitrate) in Dal Lake. The WQI(min) model predicted the water quality of the Dal Lake with a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.96, root mean square error (RMSE) value of 4.1, and percentage error (PE) of 5.3%.

The BC measurements are sparse in high altitude locations of the world particularly over the Northern regions of Pakistan. This study investigated the diurnal/monthly variations of BC and its climatic impacts during the period of 2016-2017 over four high altitude locations, i.e., Astore, Gilgit, Sost and Skardu located in the Himalaya-Karakorum-Hindukush (HKH) mountain ranges in Northern Pakistan. The Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds (OPAC) model was used for the estimation of aerosol optical properties, e.g., Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Asymmetry Parameter (AP) and Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) using the BC number density corresponding to the BC mass concentration. Then the model derived optical properties (AOD, AP and SSA), surface reflectance, ozone and water vapor were used in Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model for the calculation of BC aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), Surface (SUR) and within the ATMosphere (ATM). The results revealed that the mean monthly BC concentrations were maximum during November (3.05 +/- 0.7 mu g/m(3)) as well as in December (3.05 +/- 0.5 mu g/m(3)) at Gilgit and minimum during August (1.1 +/- 0.3 mu g/m(3)) at Sost. Correspondingly, the diurnal variation of BC concentrations displayed strong fluctuations, with high concentrations in the late night and early morning during November and December for Astore and Gilgit, respectively. Generally, the BC concentrations were maximum/minimum in the morning/evening during May, June, August and September at all locations. The correlation of BC with different meteorological parameters showed that the BC has positive correlation with temperature and wind speed, while negative with relative humidity and rainfall. The HYSPLIT back trajectory analysis revealed that air masses arrived the study locations from both long distance (Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Afghanistan, India, and China) and local sources. The monthly mean maximum and minimum BC ARF values at SUR (TOA) were found to be 43.7 +/- 3.0 W/m(2) (8.2 +/- 0.2 W/m(2)) and 16.4 +/- 1.0 W/m(2) (1.2 +/- 0.1 W/m(2)), respectively, giving an averaged atmospheric forcing of 35.7 +/- 2.3 W/m(2) and 15.2 +/- 1.9 W/m(2).","[Zeb, Bahadar; Ahmad, Ifthikhar] Univ Malakand, Dept Phys, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan; [Zeb, Bahadar] Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Univ, Dept Math, Sheringal Dir Upper, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Alam, Khan] Univ Peshawar, Dept Phys, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan; [Nasir, Jawad; Mansha, Muhammad] Pakistan Space & Upper Atmosphere Res Commiss SUP, POB 8402,Off Univ Rd, Karachi 75270, Pakistan; [Bibi, Samina] Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women Univ, Dept Phys, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Malik, Sher Muhammad] Islamia Univ Bahawalpur, Dept Geog, Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan; [Ali, Mushtaq] HITEC Univ, Dept Phys, Taxila Cantt, Pakistan",,"Alam, K (corresponding author), Univ Peshawar, Dept Phys, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.",khanalam@uop.edu.pk,,,,,,,,17.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1,2020,238.0,,,,,,,,117711,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117711,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117711,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000558539100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To map and understand response of snow-mixed pixels in RS data, field experiments were conducted for linear mixing of external materials (i.e. Vegetation, Soil) with snow, using spectral-radiometer (350-2500 nm). Further, systematic non-linear mixing of snow contaminants (soil, coal, ash) in terms of size and concentration of contaminants is analysed to imitate and understand spectral response of actual field scenarios. Sensitivity of band indices along with absorption peak characteristics provide clues to discriminate the type of contaminants. SWIR region is found to be useful for discriminating size of external contaminants in snow e.g. Avalanche deposited snow from light contaminated forms.

However, because of limited data, the effect of land use on SOC inventory at regional level is poorly quantified. The present study assessed the influence of seven major land uses and agrophysical variables (soil texture, bulk density, annual rainfall and mean temperature) on SOC concentration and stock across altitudinal gradients (6-3,500 masl) of NEHR of India. Results revealed that non-agricultural land uses (grasslands and forests) registered significantly higher SOC concentration (2.20 to 2.51%) and stock (35.2-42.1 Mg ha(-1)) compared with agricultural (shifting and settled-up and lowlands), plantation and horticultural land uses (SOC, 1.44 to 1.63%; stock, 27.4-28.4 Mg ha(-1)). Principal component analysis exhibited that the variation in SOC concentration among the land uses was mostly contributed by finer fractions of soil separates (silt and clay contents), and altitudinal gradient led variation in climatic variables (rainfall and temperature). Trend analyses depicted that SOC increased with an increase in rainfall and clay content but decreased with mean temperature and soil bulk density. Along the altitudinal gradient (6 to 1,000 masl), an inconsistent increase in silt + clay, annual rainfall, SOC concentration, and stock was also observed. However, beyond 1,000 masl, the corresponding increase was linear.

The drainage system, as well as the geomorphic evolution of the region under a semi-arid climate zone with high to very high strength of rocks in areas with high relief, is dominantly controlled by the seismic instability associated with continual tectonics. In the present paper, we have analysed a block close to the epicentre of the 2001 Bhuj earthquake to understand the role of relative active tectonics in the evolution of domal landscape morphology. Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Digital Elevation Model data were used to extract drainage network in the GIS platform and evaluate active tectonics using different geomorphic indices of the Habo Hill, the second largest domal structure situated in Northern Hill Range of the Kachchh region. The average cumulative weightage of different geomorphic indices provides a quantitative tool, Index of Relative Active Tectonics (IRAT), which shows significant variations in and around the Habo Dome. Activation of earlier lineaments and generation of new lineaments controlled the morphometric evolution of the fault bound block of the region to form the Habo Dome. The undulating topography in addition to the domal shape of the study area resulted from the differential movements along several active transverse faults striking NE-SW, N-S, and NW-SE, and the regional faults striking E-W (the Kachchh Mainland Fault, the Kas Fault, and the Jikadi Fault). Stress propagations from the Himalayan range in the northeast and Suleiman range in the northwest are identified to be the causative factors for active tectonics and drainage anomalies in the area.","[Bhattacharjee, Niladri; Mohanty, Sarada Prasad] Indian Inst Technol, Indian Sch Mines, Dept Appl Geol, Dhanbad 826004, Bihar, India",,"Mohanty, SP (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Indian Sch Mines, Dept Appl Geol, Dhanbad 826004, Bihar, India.",mohantysp@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 4,2020,79.0,18,,,,,,,407,10.1007/s12665-020-09146-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-020-09146-5,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000568565400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Through a systematic literature search, we consolidated 439 peer-reviewed journal articles related to ecosystem services in the HKH. A bibliometric analysis was carried out to examine the temporal trend, geographical distribution, journal coverage, keywords used, authorship patterns, and collaboration networks in ES research on the region. The results showed an increasing trend in the publication of ecosystem services research on the HKH, with nearly 62 per cent of the journal articles being published in just the last five years. Most of the research has been carried out in China, followed by Nepal and India. Among the 166 scholarly journals publishing ecosystem services research on the HKH, Ecosystem Services and Sustainability are the most-used, followed by Science of the Total Environment. The keywords analysis identified a total of 1,460 keywords used in the articles on ES. Among them, 'ecosystem services' is the most commonly used, followed by 'China', 'Nepal', conservation', and `biodiversity.' The authorship analysis revealed that of the total of 1,386 authors, 1,000 co-authored ES publications. The top publishing authors are from the region; however, they are either affiliated with an international organization or based in developed countries. Research institutions from 56 countries have networked to conduct collaborative ES research in the HKH, so far. Although China has the highest number of publications, Nepal was identified as a principal collaborator with the widest country network. The existing research focuses on biophysical elements of ecosystem services, with very few published studies covering its social and political aspects and the management of ecosystem services. As the HKH is a contiguous ecosystem shared by eight countries, there is a need for regional analyses of ecosystem services. Our study concludes that ecosystem services being a multidisciplinary concept, research into it requires regional collaboration between multiple actors from varied disciplines, with a greater emphasis on social and political science, together with the biophysical sciences, for a more holistic understanding. Furthermore, it is important that ES research include the local context and issues to avoid the dominance of international perspectives and the marginalization of local concerns.","[Kandel, Pratikshya; Chettri, Nakul; Chaudhary, Sunita; Sharma, Prashanti; Uddin, Kabir] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Kandel, Pratikshya] Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",,"Chettri, N (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.",nakul.chettri@icimod.org,,,,,,,,26.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,121.0,,,,,,,,107152,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107152,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107152,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000604861300014,View Full Record in Web of Science

On the one hand, studies on individual plants provide rather mechanistic, isolated insights, making it impossible to identify interactions and the properties of plant communities relevant for adequate vegetation management. On the other hand, plant community analysis alone only reveals shifts in the composition of species and biomass, but does not explain cause-and-effect relationships related to the impact of grazing at species level. The combined and participatory approach suggested in this paper describes how a more tangible, quantifiable relationship can be established between individual plant and community level processes. Such an approach, which involves herders in expert assessment and data collection, enables better monitoring and forecasting of those changes in plant community composition that are relevant for livestock husbandry and sustainable resource use. In this study, the highest dry matter production (DMP) was recorded at altitudes between 1200 m (with 1945 kg/ha) and 1600 m (with 1921 kg/ha). In freely grazed rangeland-where access is riot limited and no manual improvement measures are taken-the proportion of palatable forage species is much lower than in fenced rangeland, where access is limited and the stocking rate reduced to one third. Such integrated assessment of rangeland conditions ultimately provides the baseline for evaluating changes in ecosystems over time; it also provides a sound basis for negotiation among stakeholders with different interests.","HUJRA, Opposite Govt Degree Coll Girls, Swat, NWFP, Pakistan; Univ Bern, Ctr Dev & Environm, NCCR NS, CH-3008 Bern, Switzerland",,"HUJRA, Opposite Govt Degree Coll Girls, Coll Colony Saldu Sharif, Swat, NWFP, Pakistan.",irahim33@hotmail.com; Daniel.Maselli@cde.unibe.ch,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2004,24.0,2,,,,,124,133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000222056000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

No difference was observed for the concentration level and optical property of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in snow between urban and mountain sites, indicating that the local anthropogenic activity plays a little role in snow DOC. The low MAC(365) value implied that the DOC has had experienced extensive atmospheric processing prior to reaching the Tibetan Plateau. Lastly, radiocarbon measurement reveals that the contribution of BB in snow DOC is 80% +/- 5%, which is similar to the DOC aerosol transported from South Asia. The findings suggest that South Asian BB smoke plays a key role in Tibetan Plateau snow DOC. Given that BB simultaneously emits DOC and strong light-absorbing pollutants (e.g., black carbon), our work provides a guidance that South Asian BB control is one of the priorities to mitigate Tibetan Plateau glacier melting.","[Liu, Junwen; Chang, Ming] Jinan Univ, Inst Environm & Climate Res, Guangzhou 511443, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Zhineng; Zhu, Sanyuan; Ding, Ping; Li, Jun; Zhang, Gan] Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, Stake Key Lab Organ Geochem, State Key Lab Isotope Geochem, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Cheng, Zhineng; Zhu, Sanyuan; Li, Jun; Zhang, Gan] CAS Ctr Excellence Deep Earth Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China; [Liu, Fobang] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biomol Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",,"Zhang, G (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, Stake Key Lab Organ Geochem, State Key Lab Isotope Geochem, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.;Zhang, G (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Deep Earth Sci, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.",zhanggan@gig.ac.cn,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 14,2021,8.0,12,,,,,1026,1031,,10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00860,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.1c00860,,NOV 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000731921900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The presence of several biodiversity hotspots highlights South Asia as a biodiversity rich with a high degree of endemism. However, little is known about the diversity of native tree species in this region. Here, we summarize the information on the diversity and distributions of native tree species in South Asia. A country-wise inventory of native tree species and their geographical occurrence was compiled across eight South Asian countries using the Global Tree Search and Global Biodiversity Information Facility database. A total of 3,172 native tree species were recorded in 138 families in the region. We found that > 50% of them belonged to 15 highly diverse families led by Rubiaceae (223 spp), Lauraceae (217 spp) and Leguminosae (164 spp). Syzygium (102 spp), Ficus (81 spp) and Diospyros (74 spp) were the top three genus with high native tree diversity. Although India topped the list with 2,613 species, however, based on the country's per unit land area, Bhutan and Sri Lanka had high tree diversity. India and Sri Lanka were ranked high, with 651 and 382 species of endemic trees. Around 33% of Sri Lanka's native tree diversity was found to be threatened and had a high risk of loss of biodiversity. Two Himalayan neighbours, Bhutan, and Nepal had 50% similarity in their native tree species. Overlaying land cover patterns with native tree distribution revealed that South Asian urban landscapes were mainly dominated by IUCN's least-concern (LC) Red Listed native tree species.

The Yala and Thana glaciers in Nepal and Bhutan, respectively, were selected to represent the central Himalayas. The Sachin glacier in Pakistan was selected to represent the western Himalayas. The samples were collected during the pre- and post-monsoon seasons of the year 2016. The samples were analyzed for black carbon (BC) and water-insoluble organic carbon (OC) through the thermal optical method. The average mass concentrations (BC 2381 ng g(-1); OC 3896 ng g(-1); dust 101 mu g g(-1)) in the western Himalayas (Sachin glacier) were quite high compared to the mass concentrations (BC 358 ng g(-1), OC 904 ng g(-1), dust 22 mu g g(-1)) in the central Himalayas (Yala glacier). The difference in mass concentration may be due to the difference in elevation, snow age, local pollution sources, and meteorological conditions. BC in surface snow was also estimated through Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations at the three glacier sites during the sampling periods. Simulations reasonably capture the spatial and seasonal patterns of the observed BC in snow but with a relatively smaller magnitude. Absolute snow albedo was estimated through the Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model. The absolute snow albedo reduction ranged from 0.48 % (Thana glacier during September) to 24 % (Sachin glacier during May) due to BC and 0.13 % (Yala glacier during September) to 5 % (Sachin glacier during May) due to dust. The instantaneous radiative forcing due to BC and dust was estimated in the range of 0 to 96.48 and 0 to 25 W m(-2), respectively. The lowest and highest albedo reduction and radiative forcing were observed in central and western Himalayan glaciers, respectively. The potential source regions of the deposited pollutants were inferred using WRF-Chem tagged-tracer simulations. Selected glaciers in the western Himalayas were mostly affected by long-range transport from the Middle East and central Asia; however, the central Himalayan glaciers were mainly affected by local and south Asia emissions (from Nepal, India, and China) especially during the pre-monsoon season. Overall, south Asia and west Asia were the main contributing source regions of pollutants.","[Gul, Chaman; Kang, Shichang] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryosphere Sci, Lanzhou 73000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Gul, Chaman; Puppala, Siva Praveen; Koch, Inka; Muhammad, Sher] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Gul, Chaman; Dubache, Getachew] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Reading Acad, 219 Ningliu Rd, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Gul, Chaman; Kang, Shichang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Xiaokang; Xu, Yangyang] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Atmospher Sci, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [He, Cenlin; Kumar, Rajesh] Natl Ctr Atmospher Res, Res Applicat Lab, Boulder, CO 80301 USA; [Koch, Inka] Univ Tubingen, Dept Geosci, Schnarrenbergstr 94-96, D-72076 Tubingen, Germany",,"Gul, C (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryosphere Sci, Lanzhou 73000, Gansu, Peoples R China.;Gul, C; Puppala, SP (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.;Gul, C (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Reading Acad, 219 Ningliu Rd, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Gul, C (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",gulchamangul76@yahoo.com; sivapraveen.puppala@icimod.org,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 7,2022,22.0,13,,,,,8725,8737,,10.5194/acp-22-8725-2022,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-8725-2022,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000821465200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is imperative to assess its trend and the rates at which it is occurring. The changes will have long-lasting impact on regional climate and in turn on biodiversity. In North-East India, one of the recognized global biodiversity hotspots, approximately 30% of total forest cover is under pressure of rapid land use changes. This region harbors variety of rare and endemic species of flora and fauna. It also has a strong bearing on regional climatic conditions. Extensive shifting cultivation, compounded by increasing population pressure and demands for agriculture land are the prime drivers in addition to other proximate drivers of deforestation. It is therefore of prime concern to analyse forest cover changes in the region, assess rate of change and extent and to identify the areas, which show repetitive changes. We analyzed forest cover maps from six temporal datasets based on satellite data interpretation, converted to geospatial database since 1972 till 1999. The states of Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura show highest changes in forest cover. Arunachal Pradesh shows least dynamic areas and maintains a good forest cover owing to its topographical inaccessibility in some areas. The present study reports the forest cover changes in the region using geospatial analysis and analyse them to devise proper management strategies.","[Lele, Nikhil] ATREE, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Joshi, P.

A Cross-sectional study was conducted on 500 farmers to appraise the association of pesticide toxins and self-reported health status among the farmers by using suitable statistical and mathematical techniques. In the study, most frequently reported symptoms of health issues among the respondents were related to eye illness (blurred vision, irritation), among both sprayers (43.1%) and (11%) in non-sprayers, with relatively high risk rate (RR = 3.9), followed by illnesses such as nervous disorders (headache, dizziness), 39% (sprayers) & 21.5% (non-sprayers) and skin illnesses i.e. skin itching and allergies. Chi-square analysis and odds ratios show a significant association between the farmer's education, use of safety measures and pesticide poisoning.

We evaluated the impacts of Arundo donax AGT in different configurations on SOC sequestration, aggregate stability, and carbon management index (CMI) since 2017 under maize-based cropping systems on a 4% land slope, where eight treatment procedures were adopted. The results revealed that A. donax placement at 0.5-m vertical-interval pea-wheat (M + AD10G(0.5)-P-W) treatment had similar to 23% increase in SOC stock (27.87 Mgha(-1)) compared to the maize-wheat (M-W) system in the 0-30-cm soil layer. M + AD10G(0.5)-P-W and maize-pea-wheat treatments under bench terracing (M-P-W)(BT) had similar impacts on SOC stocks in that layer after 5 years of cropping. The total SOC values in bulk soils, macroaggregates, and microaggregates were similar to 24, 20, and 31% higher, respectively, in plots under M + AD10G0.5-P-W treatment than M-W in the topsoil (0-5 cm). The inclusion of post-rainy season vegetable pea in the maize-wheat cropping system, along with AGT application and crop residue management, generated additional biomass and enhanced CMI by similar to 60% in the plots under M + AD10G0.5-P-W treatment over M-W, although M + AD10G0.5-P-W and (M-P-W)(BT) had similar effects in the topsoil. In the 5-15-cm layer, there was no significant effect of soil conservation practices on CMI values. Under the M + AD10G0.5-P-W treatment, the annual mean soil loss decreased by similar to 92% over M-W treatment. We observed that CMI, proportion of macroaggregates, aggregate-associated C, labile C, total SOC concentration (thus, SOC accumulation rate), and mean annual C input were strongly correlated with the mean annual soil loss from 2017 to 2021. The study revealed that the emplacement of an A. donax mat and incorporation of a legume in a cropping system (M-W), conservation tillage, and crop residue retention not only prevented soil loss but also enhanced C sequestration compared to farmers' practice (M-W) in the Indian Himalayas. The significance of this study is soil conservation, recycling of residues and weeds, and climate change adaptation and mitigation, as well as increasing farmers' income.","[Roy, Plabani; Bhattacharyya, Ranjan; Biswas, D.

Therefore, a diversified pecan-based agroforestry experiment was conducted (2010-2016) with an aim to enhance productivity, profitability and resilience over sole cropping (without pecan) in the rainfed ecosystem of the Indian Himalaya. It was hypothesized that integration of seasonal crops in the alleys of pecan trees will improve production, livelihood and returns due to diversified output. Four cropping systems, viz. FM-L, FM-W, S-L and S-W were evaluated under pecan and sole cropping. Between two situations, wheat equivalent grain yield (WEGY) and production efficiency (PE) were significantly higher in sole cropping (15.06 & 16.3%) as compared to under pecan. Among cropping systems WEGY was significantly higher in S-W ranging between 4.9 and 51.4% compared to other cropping systems. S-W system was also significantly more productive. In 2016 fruit, wood, litter fall and C stock were recorded as 1.11, 21.31, 8.44 and 46.50 t ha(-1) for pecan, respectively. The grain productivity of crops was positively correlated with rainfall. The gross returns was threefold with pecan as compared to sole cropping (1345.9 $ ha(-1)) concerning 2016. Irrespective of growing situations S-W (3629.2 $ ha(-1)) cropping system provided maximum gross returns in year 2016. Hence, it is concluded that pecan-based agroforestry is more profitable in terms of economics, diversified output and ecological balance.","[Yadav, R. P.; Bisht, J. K.; Mondal, T.; Meena, V.

This study presents the high-resolution snow depth mapping of avalanche-prone regions of the Manali-Dhundi area, Himachal Pradesh (HP), India, using, repeated UAV Photogrammetric surveys. The images captured by an RGB camera mounted on a fixed-wing UAV (e-Bee X) were used to generate the high-resolution Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Orthophotos of the study area. Mapping of snow depth of the study area is crucial for avalanche hazard assessment and safe movement of the personnel and vehicles passing through the highways in this area during winters. A total of 12 km(2) area covering six major avalanche sites was surveyed. A snow depth map was generated by differencing co-registered snow-covered DSM and bare surface DSM. UAV-derived snow depth values have been validated with the point snow depth measurements of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), manual observation station, and snow depth around a structure of known height in the survey area. The UAV-retrieved snow depth values were found in good correlation with field-measured snow depth (R = 0.95). The maximum and minimum observed snow depth values at different locations on open slopes and flat areas were 1.62 m and 0.79 m. The estimated Mean Error (ME) and RMSE based on these measured values were found 0.15 and 0.21 m, respectively. The study reveals that the snow depth map generated from the UAV survey provides reliable estimates of snow depth values for flat areas and open slopes but the method is not suitable for forested areas. The study also infers that the statistical measures (i.e., mu, sigma, RMSE, etc.) derived from the complete survey dataset without considering topographic factors and features of the region will not provide realistic estimates of snow depth and its accuracy. The study suggests that regular monitoring (before and after every snow storm) of the snow depth using a UAV-based method is quick, cost-effective, and provides accurate snow conditions for operational use and planning in snow-bound regions.","[Dewali, Sanjay Kumar; Dhamija, Sudhir; Singh, Dhiraj Kumar] Def Geoinformat Res Estab, Chandigarh, UT, India; [Dewali, Sanjay Kumar; Jain, Kamal] Indian Inst Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India",,"Dewali, SK (corresponding author), Def Geoinformat Res Estab, Chandigarh, UT, India.;Dewali, SK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India.",dewali.sk.dgre@gov.in,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 13,2022,37.0,27,,,,,17260,17287,,10.1080/10106049.2022.2127923,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2022.2127923,,SEP 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000868228300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Currently, knowledge on the country-wide distribution and cancer risks of atmospheric organic toxicants in Nepal remains limited. In this study, the concentrations, sources, and distributions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), along with their cancer risks, were investigated in Nepal by using tree bark as a passive air sampler. After transferring by a bark/air partitioning model, the averaged concentrations of Sigma PAHs, Sigma DDTs, Sigma HCHs, HCB, Sigma Endo and Sigma PCBs in the atmosphere of Nepal were 3.71 x 10(4) pg/m(3), 1.10 x 10(3) pg/m(3), 2.92 x 10(2) pg/m(3), 4.38 x 10(2) pg/m(3), 4.66 pg/m(3) and 65.8 pg/m(3), respectively. Source diagnosis suggested that biomass burning is the major source for PAHs, while local application and long-range transport jointly contribute to the high levels of DDT and HCH in the air. The ILCR (incremental lifetime cancer risk) value was used to assess the risks of various chemicals. Adults have a higher risk than other age groups; the major exposure pathway for risk is by inhalation; and PAHs and HCHs are the dominant chemical classes that lead to risk. It was also found that, in certain hotspots in south Nepal, the carcinogenic risks caused by DDT and HCH were particularly high (> 1 x 10(-4)). Given that illegal and disordered use of legacy POPs in south Nepal and the IGP region is common, our results highlight an urgent need for voluntary regulation of the ongoing use of pesticides.","[Wang, Xiaoyan; Gong, Ping; Wang, Chuanfei; Wang, Xiaoping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Gong, Ping; Wang, Xiaoping] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoyan; Wang, Xiaoping] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Pokhrel, Balram] Kathmandu Univ, Sch Sci, Dhulikhel 45200, Nepal; [Dotel, Jagdish] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Hydrol & Meteorol, Kathmandu 44618, Nepal",,"Wang, CF; Wang, XP (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",wangchuanfei@itpcas.ac.cn; wangxp@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,12.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2020,186.0,,,,,,,,109510,10.1016/j.envres.2020.109510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.109510,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000548186300044,View Full Record in Web of Science

Nineteen transects with a total of 266 samplings were made in the forests along the corridor during June 1997 to June 1999. Human utilised forest (open canopy forest) and relatively unutilised forest (closed canopy forest) were designated for the study at two ecological zones, i.e. lower forest (1780-2350 m a.s.l.) and upper forest (2350-3600 in) depending on the natural resources utilisation pattern by local community living in the area and for tourism purposes. There were visible changes in the open and closed canopy forests in diameters at breast height class distribution of trees leading to distinct variation in the habitat types. Among the 143 species of birds observed during the study, a handful of species were found as habitat specific and about 40% were common to all the four habitat types. Both bird species richness and diversity were higher at the open canopy conditions compared with closed canopy, but the differences were not statistically significant. On the other hand, both the indices showed strong and significant negative relationship with the elevation. These diversity indices were also significantly higher during the summer compared with the winter season. The open canopy conditions exhibited comparatively more species of birds that were perturbated by human settlements than those species found at the closed canopy (mostly forest interior) and vice versa. Though the study could not trace out the effect of patch size brought about by human caused disturbances, the Yuksam-Dzongri trekking corridor possesses diverse habitat types as well as bird species resulted from heterogeneous habitat conditions. It is therefore important to emphasise disturbance study for threshold level assessment so that generalists as well as forest interior species could be managed through conservation efforts.

An investigation over fourteen month was undertaken at a rural site located in the Western Himalayan region, to evaluate the PM associated fungal spores' concentration and diversity. The season-wise change in the fungal spores concentration in the Coarse Particulate Matter (CPM) fraction (aerodynamic diameter > 10 mu m) varied from 500 to 3899 spores m(-3). Their average concentration over 14 months was 1517 spores m(-3). Significant diversity of fungal spores in the CPM samples was observed; 27 individual genera of fungal spores were identified, of which many were known allergens. Presence of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota fungal spores was dominant in the samples; similar to 20% of the spores were un-characterized. The season wise variability in fungal spores showed a statistically significant high correlation with CPM load. Maximum number concentration of the spores in CPM was recorded in the summer, while minimum in the winter. The high diversity of spores occurred during monsoon and post monsoon months. The meteorological factors played an important role in the fungal spores' distribution profile. The temporal profile of the spores showed significant correlation with the ambient temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (WS) and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height. Strong correlation of WS with fungal spores and CPM, and wind back trajectories suggest that re-suspension and wind assisted transport of PM contributes to ambient CPM associated fungal spores.

The results indicate the trend of cation dominance as Ca2+ > Na+>Mg2+ > K+, whereas anion dominance was in the order of HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-. Ratio of calcium to magnesium indicated the dissolution of Ca2+ from CaCO3, which results in an increased levels of Ca2+ in the groundwater. Interpretation of Piper Trilinear plot understands the various geochemical processes affecting the groundwater quality and shows groundwater was dominated by Ca-HCO3 type. The pH was recorded in the slightly alkalinity range 7.2-7.8 and was showing positive correlation with HCO3-. The chloro-alkaline indices revealed 86% of the sources exchange by a type of base-exchange reactions, rest by cation-anion exchange.

BB contributed a significant fraction to OC, averaging 24.9% +/- 10.4% during the whole year, and up to 36.3% +/- 10.4% in the post-monsoon season. On an annual average basis, anthropogenic toluene-derived secondary OC accounted for 8.8% and biogenic secondary OC contributed 6.2% to total OC. The annual contribution of fungal spores to OC was 3.2% with a maximum during the monsoon season (5.9 %). For plant debris, it accounted for 1.4% of OC during the monsoon. Therefore, OC is mainly associated with BB and other anthropogenic activity in the KV. Our findings are conducive to designing effective measures to mitigate the heavy air pollution and its impacts in the KV and surrounding area.","[Wan, Xin; Zhang, Qianggong; Cong, Zhiyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Kang, Shichang; Tripathee, Lekhendra; Guo, Junming; Chen, Pengfei; Rupakheti, Dipesh] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Rupakheti, Maheswar; Lawrence, Mark G.] IASS, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany; [Rupakheti, Maheswar] Himalayan Sustainabil Inst HIMSI, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Panday, Arnico K.] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Khumaltar, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Kawamura, Kimitaka] Chubu Univ, Chubu Inst Adv Studies, Kasugai, Aichi 4878501, Japan; [Kang, Shichang; Zhang, Qianggong; Cong, Zhiyuan] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wan, Xin] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China",,"Cong, ZY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Cong, ZY (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhiyuancong@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,36.0,40.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 4,2019,19.0,5,,,,,2725,2747,,10.5194/acp-19-2725-2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-2725-2019,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000460204600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of this study is to quantify the effects of gravity erosion on soil loss, especially the changes of particle size distribution of the suspended sediment. Materials and methods In this study, experiments were conducted in a field mobile laboratory in which mass movements were triggered on steep slopes under simulated rainfall. During the experiments, water-sediment samples were collected in polyethylene bottles directly from the gully and channel flows before and during the mass movements. The volumes of each mass failure during and 20 min after the rainfalls were measured by a topography meter. The particle fractions of the samples were analyzed by combining the sieving and photoelectric sedimentometer techniques. A suite of indexes such as median sediment size (d(50)), sediment heterogeneity (H), fractal dimension (D), and enrichment/dilution ratio (R-ed) were then used to evaluate the effect of mass movement on PSDSS. Results and discussion (1) Gravity erosion had a significant influence on PSDSS. After the mass movements occurred, the proportion of sand-sized particles was decreased from 71 to 51%, whereas the proportions of clay and silt were increased from 1 to 7% and 28 to 42%, respectively. (2) The d(50), H, and D were significantly correlated with slope failures. The d(50) was decreased from 0.084 to 0.051 mm, whereas the H and D were increased from 5.6 to 26.8 and from 2.60 to 2.78, respectively. This implies that mass movements make the PSDSS more nonuniform and irregular. (3) The suspended sediment tended to be enriched in the silt and clay fractions and diluted in the sand fractions after mass movements. R(ed)s for clay, slit, and sand fractions were 13.9, 1.4, and 0.7 respectively. Conclusions The changes of PSDSS after mass movements reflected a combined complex effect of soil sources, erosion types, selective detachment, and deposition processes. Mass movements led to a drastic increase of sediment concentration and the enrichment of fine particles, which developed into hyperconcentrated flows.","[Guo, Wenzhao; Wang, Wenlong] Northwest Agr & Forestry Univ, Inst Soil & Water Conservat, State Key Lab Soil Eros & Dryland Farming Loess P, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Guo, Wenzhao; Xu, Xiangzhou; Liu, Yakun] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Hydraul Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Tongxin] Univ Minnesota, Dept Geog Urban Environm & Sustainabil Studies, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Zhang, Hongwu; Zhu, Mingdong] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Hydrosci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",,"Xu, XZ (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Hydraul Engn, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China.",xzxu@dlut.edu.cn,,,,,,,,16.0,18.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2020,20.0,3,,,,,1730,1741,,10.1007/s11368-019-02496-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-019-02496-z,,NOV 2019,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000498948800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Especially the state of Sikkim lies in the eastern Himalayan ecological hotspot region. The state harbors many sulfur rich hot springs which have therapeutic and spiritual values. However, these hot springs are yet to be explored for their microbial ecology. The development of neo generation techniques such as metagenomics has provided an opportunity for inclusive study ofmicrobial community of different environment. The present study describes the microbial diversity in two hot springs of Sikkim that is Polok and Borong with the assist of culture dependent and culture independent approaches. The culture independent techniques used in this study were next generation sequencing (NGS) and Phospholipid Fatty Acid Analysis (PLFA). Having relatively distinct geochemistry both the hot springs are thermophilic environments with the temperature range of 50-77 degrees C and pH range of 5-8. Metagenomic data revealed the dominance of bacteria over archaea. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes although other phyla were also present such as Acidobacteria, Nitrospirae, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Parcubacteria and Spirochaetes. The PLFA studies have shown the abundance of Gram Positive bacteria followed by Gram negative bacteria. The culture dependent technique was correlative with PLFA studies. Most abundant bacteria as isolated and identified were Gram-positive genus Geobacillus and Anoxybacillus. The genus Geobacillus has been reported for the first time in North-Eastern states of India. The Geobacillus species obtained fromthe concerned hot springs were Geobacillus toebii, Geobacillus lituanicus, Geobacillus Kaustophillus and the Anoxybacillus species includes Anoxybacillus gonensis and Anoxybacillus Caldiproteolyticus. The distribution of major genera and their statistical correlation analyses with the geochemistry of the springs predicted that the temperature, pH, alkalinity, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl2+, and sulfur were main environmental variables influencing the microbial community composition and diversity. Also the piper diagram suggested that the water of both the hot springs are Ca-HCO3- type and can be predicted as shallow fresh groundwaters. This study has provided an insight into the ecological interaction of the diverse microbial communities and associated physicochemical parameters, which will help in determining the future studies on different biogeochemical pathways in these hot springs.

In the present theoretical study, the washout coefficients are computed for the aerosols of diameters in the range of 0.02-10 mum having various densities in accordance with their chemical compositions for heavy rain regime. The theoretical scavenging rates are applied to the observed average particle size distributions of pre-monsoon months of the year 1998 and 1999 for Pune and 1999 for Himalayan regions. The evolution of particle size distributions at different time intervals for the non-hygroscopic particles of CaCO3, MgCO3, Zn and Mn indicates that the inertial impaction mechanism is the dominant one in removing particles of all sizes for the heavy rain regime. The size dependence of aerosols as a function of relative humidity is considered for the estimation of washout coefficients of hygroscopic particles such as NaCl and (NH4)(2)SO4. The washout coefficients are found to be highly dependent on relative humidity for hygroscopic particles. The rainwater concentrations are predicted as a function of rainfall depth and a comparison is made with the observed rainwater concentrations of sequential samples collected on 27 June 2001 in a single rain event to support the results of this theoretical work. The predicted rainwater concentrations for RH = 50% are about two times larger than that for RH = 95% in the case of hygroscopic particles. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We used multivariate and bivariate analysis and geographic information system techniques to analyze ecological data and land use trends. A significant annual change with a 3.38% decrease in glacier area was observed between 1978 and 1996. We observed 168 plant species in the SNPBZ with a range of 3-17 species per sample plot, where about 67% of plants were found to be palatable for livestock. Our study shows that total available fodder biomass on rangeland in the SNPBZ has not been fully utilized yet, because the total available supply exceeds the present demand under some assumptions: reduction of biomass through grazing causes higher productivity, resulting in a higher number of species, according to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

The water is found to be slightly alkaline having pH value 7.22-8.66. Both Ca2+ and Mg2+ are observed as the dominant cations, whereas SO42- and HCO3- are dominant anions during all seasons. The Piper plot has shown Ca2+-HCO3- type of water during pre- to post-monsoon seasons. Alkaline earth metals (Ca2+ and Mg2+) are noticed to exceed over alkali metals (Na+ and K+), and weak acid (HCO3-) surpass over strong acid (SO42-) in all seasons. The carbonate weathering of surrounding rocks is found to be the dominant source of major ions for the lake during pre- to post-monsoon. The WQI values 176.45-184.91 from monsoon to pre-monsoon have revealed that the water of Renuka Lake is unsuitable for drinking. The higher value of WQI is mainly due to increased concentration of F-, which is produced fromthefluorapatite, cryolite and mica etc., and anthropogenic activities. Its concentration more than standard permissible limit may be veryharmful for human being and aquatic species. However, based on sodium per cent (11.88-15.62%), sodium adsorption ratio (0.48-0.61) and residual sodium carbonate (<2.5meq/L), the water quality is determined fit for irrigation. The lake has indicated seasonal variations of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+ and HCO3-, etc., which may be due to changing temperature, monsoon rain and human activities. Thus, stringent mitigation measures are required to reduce increased concentration of various physiochemical parameters and preservation of the Renuka Lake.","[Kumar, Pawan; Mahajan, Ambrish Kumar] Cent Univ Himachal Pradesh, Dept Environm Sci, Dharamshala 176215, India; [Meena, Narendra Kumar] Wadia Inst Himalayan Geol, 33 GMS Rd, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Kumar, P (corresponding author), Cent Univ Himachal Pradesh, Dept Environm Sci, Dharamshala 176215, India.",pawan.evs@gmail.com,,,,,,,,18.0,18.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2019,78.0,10,,,,,,,319,10.1007/s12665-019-8315-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8315-z,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000468096000009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study was conducted post-monsoon season over Darjeeling (latitude 27 degrees 01' N longitude 88 degrees 36' E, 2200 masl), a tourist destination in north-eastern India. In addition to the aerosols and cloud characterization and atmospheric boundary layer detection, the profile of the water vapor mixing ratio has also been analyzed. Effects of atmospheric dynamics have been studied using the vertical profiles of the normalized standard deviation of RCS along with the water vapor mixing ratio. The aerosol optical characteristics below and above the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) region were studied separately, along with the interrelation of their optical and microphysical properties with synoptic meteorological parameters. The backscatter coefficient and the extinction coefficient were found in the range from 7.15 x 10(-10) m(-1) sr(-1) to 3.01 x 10(-5) m(-1) sr(-1) and from 1.02 x 10(-5) m(-1) to 2.28 x 10(-3) m(-1), respectively. The LIDAR ratio varies between 3.9 to 78.39 sr over all altitudes. The variation of the linear depolarization ratio from 0.19 to 0.32 indicates the dominance, of non-spherical particles. The periodicity observed in different parameters may be indicative of atmospheric wave phenomena.

Although the two events could be independent, we hypothesized that phenotypic plasticity in floral traits might help to coordinate plant-pollinator interactions and enhance plant reproductive success in changing habitats. To test this hypothesis, we investigated floral traits and pollination on three natural populations of a lousewort (Pedicularis siphonantha) ranging at different elevations, as well as two downward transplanted populations in Shangeri-La County and Deqin County, northwest Yunnan, China. The results indicated that floral traits, i.e. phenology, longevity, display size, corolla tube length and pollen production differed significantly among populations. Moreover, or the two transplanted populations, floral traits diverged from their original populations, but converged to their host populations. Although the phenotypic plasticity in floral traits might be a rapid response to abiotic factor such as warmer environment, the changes in floral traits were found to be well adapted to pollination environment of the host population. Compared with plants of their original habitats in higher elevation, the transplanted individuals advanced flowering time, shortened flower longevity, reduced floral display size and pollen production, received higher visiting frequency and yielded more seeds. These findings suggested that phenotypic plasticity of floral traits might help plants adjust their resource allocation strategy between pre- and post-pollination stages in response to harsh or temperate conditions, which might correspondingly meet a pollinator-poor or hyphen rich environment. This would be beneficial for the widely-distributed species to adapt to various environmental changes.","[Dai Wen-kui; Amboka, Grace Mercy; Kadiori, Edwin Luguba; Wang Qing-Feng; Yang Chun-Feng] Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Dai Wen-kui; Amboka, Grace Mercy; Kadiori, Edwin Luguba] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,"Wang, QF; Yang, CF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Wuhan Bot Garden, Key Lab Aquat Bot & Watershed Ecol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",wenkui321@163.com; gracemercyamboka@gmail.com; kadioriedwin@yahoo.com; qfwang@wbgcas.cn; cfyang@wbgcas.cn,,,,,,,,7.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2017,14.0,10,,,,,1995,2002,,10.1007/s11629-017-4481-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-017-4481-1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000412313000008,View Full Record in Web of Science

There are several reasons for these uncertainties, such as terrain deviation co-registration among different topographic data, the mismatch between GSE (Glacier Surface Elevation) from satellite monitoring and the GMB that comprises the physical glacier properties, the driving factors of GMB, and the response patterns of the runoff within the basin. This paper proposed a method based on the ridge line co-registration of DEMs (Digital Elevation Models), and the Tailan River basin, which is a typical glacier melt runoff recharge basin located in the southern Tianshan Mountains, was selected. Abnormal values in GSE changes were removed using ice thickness data, and the GSE results were optimized based on the regularity of the GSE change with altitude to estimate the GMB. The driving factors of the GMB and the response characteristics of the runoff in the basin were also explored. The results showed that the accuracy of the optimized GSE results across different periods has improved by more than 25%. The mean annual thinning value of GSE in the basin from 2000 to 2022 was -0.25 & PLUSMN; 0.02 m & BULL;a(-1), corresponding to a GMB value of -0.30 & PLUSMN; 0.02 m w.e.a(-1), indicating a consistent GMB loss state. Combined with climate data, the glaciers in the basin were impacted by rising temperatures, and the smallest increase in annual precipitation in the basin was insufficient to compensate for the GMB loss. Moreover, in the past 22 years, glacier meltwater accounts for 46.15% of the total runoff in the Tailan River basin.","[Yang, Bin; Du, Weibing; Li, Junli; Bao, Anming; Wang, Shuangting; Lyu, Xiaoxuan; Gao, Xin; Cheng, Xiaoqian] Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Surveying & Land Informat Engn, Jiaozuo 454003, Peoples R China; [Du, Weibing; Li, Junli; Bao, Anming] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Du, Weibing; Li, Junli; Bao, Anming] CAS HEC, China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan; [Du, Weibing; Li, Junli; Bao, Anming] Xinjiang Key Lab Remote Sensing & Geograph Informa, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Ge, Wen] Informat Engn Univ, Inst Surveying & Mapping, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Ge, Wen; Wang, Shuangting; Lyu, Xiaoxuan; Cheng, Xiaoqian] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geoinformat Technol Smart C, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China; [Ge, Wen; Wang, Shuangting; Lyu, Xiaoxuan; Cheng, Xiaoqian] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Spatiotemporal Percept & Intelligent Proc, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China",,"Du, WB (corresponding author), Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Surveying & Land Informat Engn, Jiaozuo 454003, Peoples R China.;Du, WB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.;Du, WB (corresponding author), CAS HEC, China Pakistan Joint Res Ctr Earth Sci, Islamabad 45320, Pakistan.;Du, WB (corresponding author), Xinjiang Key Lab Remote Sensing & Geograph Informa, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",yangbin@home.hpu.edu.cn; dwb@hpu.edu.cn; ijl@ms.xjb.ac.cn; baoam@ms.xjb.ac.cn; lvwen1016@163.com; wst@hpu.edu.cn; lxx@home.hpu.edu.cn; 212004020060@home.hpu.edu.cn; cxq@hpu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2023,15.0,15,,,,,,,2762,10.3390/w15152762,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15152762,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001045826500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Support estimation performed by traditional approaches for slope failure mitigation could be highly inaccurate due to inaccuracies in the estimated statistics of properties. This article describes a computationally efficient re-sampling stochastic framework to overcome this issue by coupling the Advanced Re-Sampling Reliability Approach (ARRA) with deterministic and Target Reliability Approach (TRA) to estimate the required support for rock-slides mitigation with limited data. The proposed methodology was demonstrated for the support design to mitigate two massive rockslides along a rockslide-prone highway, i.e., Rishikesh-Badrinath National Highway (NH-58) in India. It was concluded that the limited data invokes uncertainties in the statistical parameters (mean and standard deviation) and distributions of properties. Support estimated using traditional approaches with the inaccurate statistics of input properties can result in inaccurate support estimates in the presence of insufficient data. Proposed methodology couples ARRA with traditional methods and evaluates the final support design by quantifying the uncertainty in the reliability index induced by the statistical uncertainties of input properties statistics. This improves the overall accuracy, efficiency, and the designer's confidence in the estimated support.","[Kumar, Akshay; Tiwari, Gaurav] IIT Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Tiwari, G (corresponding author), IIT Kanpur, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India.",gauravt@iitk.ac.in,,,,,,,,7.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,81.0,2,,,,,,,38,10.1007/s12665-021-10150-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-10150-6,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000741416300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Lichens are not exceptional and are quite sensitive in comparison to other organisms; hence the present study focuses on the impact of ecological variables on the diversity and distribution of epiphytic macrolichens colonizing Quercus leucotrichophora across eight different sites (50 m x 50 m) in Thal Ke Dhar forest, Kumaun Himalaya, Uttarakhand, India. For sampling of macrolichens, 200 trees (25 trees from each site) of Q. leucotrichophora were selected from each site and five quadrats of 5 cm x 10 cm (1000 quadrats in totality) were drawn at the tree trunk. From all the sampled trees, a total of 54 species of epiphytic macrolichens belonging to 18 genera and five families were recorded. Various ecological variables, namely altitude, aspect, slope, diameter at breast height (DBH), and lopping percent (partial cutting of the twigs as disturbance), were also analyzed to investigate their influence on macrolichen species composition and distribution pattern in the study area. For the determination of relationships between these variables, statistical analysis, namely Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, Polynomial regression analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were performed. Out of all variables, lopping was significantly correlated to species richness of epiphytic macrolichens (0.712*, p < 0.05) and it was confirmed by Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. Despite of having high anthropogenic pressure or impact through lopping, the maximum number of macrolichen species was recorded at elevation 2267 meter above sea level (m asl). The present study revealed that besides other ecological variables, lopping practices can act as a key parameter in controlling the diversity and distribution not only of epiphytic macrolichens but also of other life forms such as bryophytes, pteridophytes, insects, birds etc. and can be either negatively or positively correlated.","[Upadhyay, Shashi; Joshi, Yogesh] Kumaun Univ, Lichenol Lab, SSJ Campus, Almora 263601, Uttarakhand, India; [Jugran, Arun K.] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Garhwal Unit, Srinagar 246174, Uttarakhand, India; [Upadhyay, Shashi; Suyal, Renu; Rawal, Ranbeer S.] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Biodivers Conservat & Management, Ecosyst Serv & Climate Change Grp, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India",,"Joshi, Y (corresponding author), Kumaun Univ, Lichenol Lab, SSJ Campus, Almora 263601, Uttarakhand, India.",upadhyay91shashi@gmail.com; arunjugran@gmail.com; dryogeshcalo@gmail.com; renusuyal04@gmail.com; ranbeerrawal4@gmail.com,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2018,15.0,2,,,,,307,318,,10.1007/s11629-017-4397-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-017-4397-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000425160200007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The climate-growth response analysis indicated that trees at different elevations respond differently to environmental changes. The radial growth of trees found at the middle and high elevation sites was determined by temperature variables (mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures), particularly during the summer season (June to August), while moisture availability (precipitation and relative humidity) during spring (in March) was the crucial climate factor for tree growth at the low elevation site. The linear climate-growth model derived from the composite chronology of the 2 high elevation sites was verified with independent data from 1958 to 2005, and accounted for 33.4% of the mean temperature variation during summer (June to August). Based on this model, summer minimum temperature variations were reconstructed for the past 296 yr. The reconstruction revealed that cool climates mainly occurred in 1732-1743, 1758-1780, 1791-1824, 1836-1847, 1853-1862, 1908-1929, 1964-1976, and 1979-1993, while warm climates prevailed in 1718-1731, 1744-1756, 1781-1790, 1825-1835, 1883-1907, 1930-1963, and 1995 to present. Spectral analysis of the reconstruction using the multi-taper method (MTM) indicated the existence of some multidecadal (about 70 yr) and bidecadal (about 20 yr) cycles, which might correspond to the related cycles of solar activity, and significant peaks at about 2 to 8 yr, in agreement with the spectral mode of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-type variability.","[Li, ZongShan; Shi, Chun Ming; Liu, Yongbo; Zhang, Jinlong; Zhang, Qibing; Ma, Keping] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China; [Li, ZongShan] Chinese Acad Sci, Ecoenvironm Sci Res Ctr, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Shi, Chun Ming] CEA Saclay, Lab Sci Climat & Environm, UMR 1572, IPSL CEA CNRS UVSQ, F-91191 Gif Sur Yvette, France",,"Zhang, QB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Vegetat & Environm Change, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China.",qbzhang@ibcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,22.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,,,,2011,47.0,3,,,,,207,218,,10.3354/cr01012,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr01012,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000294526300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, based on analysis of 61 surface samples, we report the spatial distribution and concentrations of BC, Hg, total organic carbon (TOC) and inorganic carbon (IC) in surface sediments of Selin Co, the largest lake in central Tibet. The mean BC and Hg concentrations were 0.62 +/- 0.34 mg/g and 32.03 +/- 9.88 ng/g (range: 0.03-1.47 mg/g and 13.83-51.81 ng/g respectively), which were lower than the values from other lakes in the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau (HTP). BC and Hg exhibited similar spatial distribution in the surface sediments. Similarly, the mean TOC and IC were 2.19 +/- 1.46% and 3.13 +/- 1.07% (range: 0.0007-7.78% and 0.30-5.30% respectively). BC/TOC ratio, as well as char/soot ratio, suggests biomass burning as a major source of BC in the sediments via the influence of long-range transport. The positive correlation between the concentrations of BC and Hg suggests similar emission sources or transport pathway. Concentrations of BC and Hg were higher in fine grain particles (size <-50 mu m) which were capable of transport and deposit in the deeper part of the lake, as suggested by a significant relationship between water depth and particle size.

Most of these sites are located in remote and isolated aged-background regions, and few are in urban/semi-urban sites having averaged AOD similar to 0.1 at 500 nm. These selected sites have a global distribution including tropical, mid-latitudes, high-latitudes and Polar regions. Among them, there are 14 high-altitude stations ( similar to 1028-5050 m amsl), including Himalayan and Polar regions. The main objective of the present work is to evaluate the AOD trends over the aged-background sites across the globe. We found that significant number of sites located in North-South America, Europe, Arctic and Australia have statistically significant and negative trends varied from - 6.3x10(-3) to -1.0x10(-3) AOD year(-1). The negative trends over these sites could be attributed to reduction in anthropogenic emission. Furthermore, there are mixed trends of positive as well as negative over Asian and southern oceanic regions including Antarctica. Some of the trends are weak and statistically nonsignificant, probably due to non-availability of long-term ground based data. However, the AOD trends over these regions show increasing tendency with statistically significant trends of 8.0x10(-4) to 4.7x10(-3) AOD year(-1). The present study has also many important aspects on global and regional climate change at high-mountain and aged-background sites in particular, where the satellite based measurements are inaccurate and biased due to extremely low AOD.","[Ningombam, Shantikumar S.] Indian Inst Astrophys, Bangalore 560034, Karnataka, India; [Larson, E.

In all four zones, no altitudinal trend of PAHs in soil and sediments was observed. Source apportionment through receptor modelling by positive matrix factorization (PMF) revealed that local sources such as biomass combustion and vehicular emissions are important sources of PAHs in this region.

Micrometeorological, atomic absorption spectroscopy for micro-elemental analysis was determined for soil. HPLC was used to determine the disparity in phytonutrient (quercetin, betacarotene, ascorbic acid, and catechin) and phytochemical (arbutin) levels. Cultivated populations had lower phytonutrient levels than wild populations.

Additionally, landscape fragmentation tool (LFT) was used to quantify fragmentation of land cover. The analysis of LULCC indicated that built-up areas in the vicinity of the wetland increased by 510% between 1965 and 2018. The aquatic vegetation and marshy lands increased by 150% and 33% respectively. The area under agriculture, plantation, open water, and barren lands decreased mostly taken over by built-up areas. Within the wetland, the area under open water spread reduced by 75% while the aquatic vegetation increased by 150% from 1965 to 2018. The built-up areas including roads also showed a substantial increase. The LFT analysis revealed four categories of landscapes i.e., patch, edge, perforated, and core areas. Since the natural land cover types were taken over by land use predominantly built-up areas, the core natural areas and perforated landscapes in the Khushalsar shrunk by 34% and 94% respectively indicating fragmentation of natural environment.

The north slope of Chogori Peak and the Keltsing River Basin presented a glacier retreat rate with a fast to slow trend. The anomaly is mainly due to low summer temperatures and heavy precipitation in winter and spring in the Karakoram region. There are a large number of surging glaciers in the Karakoram Mountains, the Pamir Plateau, and the West Kunlun region in the western part of HMA, especially in the Karakoram Mountains and the Pamir Plateau, which account for more than 70% of the number of surging glaciers in the entire HMA. The glaciers in the Karakoram and Kunlun Mountains are mainly affected by the synergistic influence of various factors, such as hydrothermal conditions, atmospheric circulation, and topography. However, the glaciers in the Pamir region are mainly influenced by the thermal mechanism of the glacier surge. The glaciers in and around Karakoram are critical to the hydrological response to climate change, and glacial meltwater is an important freshwater resource in arid and semi-arid regions of South and Central Asia, as well as in western China. Therefore, changes in the Karakoram anomaly will remain a hot research topic in the future.","[Li, Jiawei; Sun, Meiping; Yao, Xiaojun; Duan, Hongyu; Zhang, Cong; Wang, Shuyang; Niu, Shuting; Yan, Xin] Northwest Normal Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiawei; Sun, Meiping; Yao, Xiaojun; Duan, Hongyu; Zhang, Cong; Wang, Shuyang; Niu, Shuting; Yan, Xin] Key Lab Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev Oasis, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China",,"Sun, MP (corresponding author), Northwest Normal Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.;Sun, MP (corresponding author), Key Lab Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev Oasis, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",2021222956@nwnu.edu.cn; sunmeiping1982@nwnu.edu.cn; xj_yao@nwnu.edu.cn; 2020120154@nwnu.edu.cn; 2021120206@nwnu.edu.cn; 2022223072@nwnu.edu.cn; 2021212830@nwnu.edu.cn; 2021222950@nwnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2023,15.0,18,,,,,,,3215,10.3390/w15183215,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15183215,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001075024900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few studies have used a cross-platform to this end. In this study, two heterogeneous data sources, Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8, from January 2019 to January 2021, were used to estimate the offset, and then the optimal estimation of the 3D deformation rate of a Himalayan glacier was obtained based on the joint model of variance component estimation. The results show that the maximum deformation rates of the glacier in the east-west direction, north-south direction, and vertical direction are 85, 126, and 88 mm/day, respectively. The results of the joint model were compared and analyzed with the results of simultaneous optical image pixel offset tracking. The results showed that the accuracy of the joint solution model increased by 41% in the east-west direction and 36% in the south-north direction. The regional flow velocity of the moraine glacier after the joint solution was consistent with the vector boundary of the glacier cataloging data. The time-series results of the glacier displacement were calculated using more images. These results indicate that the joint solution model is feasible for calculating temporal glacier velocity. The model can improve the time resolution of the monitoring results and obtain further information on glacier characteristics. Our results show that the glacier velocity is affected by local terrain slope and temperature. However, there is no absolute positive correlation between glacier velocity and slope. This study provides a reference for the joint acquisition of large-scale three-dimensional displacement of glaciers using multi-source remote sensing data and provides support for the identification and early warning of glacier disasters.","[Yang, Chengsheng; Wei, Chunrui; Ding, Huilan] Changan Univ, Coll Geol Engn & Geomat, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Yang, Chengsheng; Wei, Chunrui] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Mine Geol Hazards Mech & Control, Xian 710054, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yunjie; Zhu, Sainan] China Inst Geoenvironm Monitoring, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wei, Yunjie] Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Chem Engn & Environm, Beijing 100124, Peoples R China; [Li, Zufeng] PowerChina Northwest Engn Corp Ltd, Xian 710065, Peoples R China",,"Wei, CR (corresponding author), Changan Univ, Coll Geol Engn & Geomat, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.;Wei, CR (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Mine Geol Hazards Mech & Control, Xian 710054, Peoples R China.",2020126050@chd.edu.cn,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2023,15.0,1,,,,,,,4,10.3390/rs15010004,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15010004,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000909302900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study delineates to examine spatiotemporal changes of vegetation cover in Pindari valley (Kumaun Himalaya) from the 1972 to 2018 timeline. The study includes the calculation of vegetation spectral indices of normalized vegetation index (NDVI), extraction of different vegetation classes, and statistical analysis of the Mann-Kendall (MK) test on historical metrological data (especially precipitation and temperature) of the study site. For the statistical analysis of metrological data, the power data access viewer datasets have been used. The central feature classes of the study are grassland, scrubland, and forest cover. The results revealed that the region's forest cover significantly decreased by 24.74 sq. km from 1972 to 2018, increased in grassland cover by 17.84 sq. km, respectively, and a slight increase in scrubland class by 3.13 sq. km for the study period. The calculated NDVI shows significant changes over the study location; it has been noticed that the maximum values of the NDVI decreased by 0.24, and the minimum values show growth of about 0.047. The analysis indicates that climatic parameters such as precipitation and temperature are the main limiting factors affecting vegetation growth. The annual mean maximum temperature showed a decreasing trend. The estimated results show an increase in annual rainfall and annual minimum temperature, while the decreasing trend is observed in the case of maximum annual temperature. Objectives of the study are (1) spatiotemporal analysis of the vegetation cover, (2) identification of the main causes of change in the vegetation cover, and (3) statistical trend analysis of long-term metrological data.

The study aims to assess the biophysical and social vulnerability of agriculture communities using an indicator-based approach for the state of Uttarakhand, India. A total of 14 indicators were used to capture biophysical vulnerability and 22 for social vulnerability profiles of 15285 villages. Vulnerability analysis was done at village level with weights assigned to each indicator using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP). The results of the study highlight the presence of very high biophysical vulnerability (0.82 +/- 0.10) and high social vulnerability (0.65 +/- 0.15) within the state. Based on the results, it was found that incidences of high biophysical vulnerability coincide with presence of intensified agriculture land and absence of dense forest. Higher social vulnerability scores were found in villages with an absence of local institutions (like Self Helping Groups (SHGs)), negligible infrastructure facilities and higher occupational dependence on agriculture. A contrast was observed in the vulnerability scores of villages present in the three different altitudinal zones in the study area, indicating respective vulnerability generating conditions existing in these three zones. Biophysical vulnerability was recorded to be highest in the villages falling in the lower zone and lowest in the upper zone villages; whereas, social vulnerability was found to be highest in the middle zone villages and lowest in lower zone villages. Our study aids policy makers in identifying areas for intervention to expedite agriculture adaptation planning in the state. Additionally, the adaptation programmes in the region need to be more context-specific to accommodate the differential altitudinal vulnerability profiles.","[Shukla, Roopam; Sachdeva, Kamna] TERI Univ, Dept Nat Resources, New Delhi 110070, India; [Joshi, Pawan Kumar] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India",,"Shukla, R (corresponding author), TERI Univ, Dept Nat Resources, New Delhi 110070, India.",roopamshukla04@gmail.com; sachdevakamna@gmail.com; pkjoshi27@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,14.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2016,13.0,12,,,,,2260,2271,,10.1007/s11629-016-4058-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-016-4058-4,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000391425900015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Forest fires drastically contribute to climate change on both regional and global scales. Forest fires-of both natural and anthropogenic origins-induce aerosols in the atmosphere and have a significant impact on the health and climate of the region. In this study, we simulate the Uttarakhand (29-31 degrees N, 78-80 degrees E) fire event in India, which occurred in April 2016, using the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model to estimate the radiative impact of the aerosols emitted due to this fire event and probe into the extent of their transport into the atmosphere. Multiple data from ground-based and satellite observations are used to access the model performance. Our analysis showed that the high values of aerosol optical depths (AODs) during the fire event simulated by WRF-Chem compared very well with MODIS AODs over the Uttarakhand region. The model simulations of the vertical profile of BC corroborate with elevated smoke aerosols derived from CALIPSO. An enhancement of smoke aerosols is observed up to 5-km altitude during the fire event both in the model simulations and observations. The fire has increased the near-surface air temperatures by 1-3 degrees C and decreased the relative humidity by similar to 10% over the affected areas. The NET (shortwave + longwave) atmospheric radiative forcing due to fire varied between similar to 10 and similar to 40 Wm(-2) in the entire affected areas, with the highest values over the source region. The fire-induced atmospheric heating rate varied between 0.5 and 1.4 K/day over the Uttarakhand region.","[Lawand, Divyaja; Bhawar, Rohini] Savitribai Phule Pune Univ, Dept Atmospher & Space Sci, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Kedia, Sumita; Islam, Sahidul; Khare, Manoj] Ctr Dev Adv Comp, Pune, Maharashtra, India; [Rahul, P.

India is the third largest coal producer in the world; it is projected to be the largest coal consumer by 2050. In the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, India, over 450 hydroelectric power schemes are proposed or are under development. Hydropower projects ranging from micro hydro (run-of-the-river systems with generating capacity up to 100 kW) to large reservoirs (storage systems up to 2000 MW) such as the Tehri Dam are in various stages of planning, construction or implementation. Run-of-the-river hydropower projects are being developed in Uttarakhand in order to avoid some of the costs to local communities created by large dams. Stakeholders in this rapid hydropower expansion include multiple actors with often diverging sets of interests. The resulting governance challenges are centered on tradeoffs between local electricity and revenue from the sale of hydropower, on the one hand, and the impacts on small-scale irrigation systems, riparian-corridor ecosystem services, and other natural resource-based livelihoods, on the other. We focus on the Bhilangana river basin, where water dependent livelihoods differentiated by gender include farming, fishing, livestock rearing and fodder collection. We examine the contradictions inherent in hydropower governance based on the interests of local residents and other stakeholders including hydropower developers, urban and other regional electricity users, and state-level policymakers. We use a social justice approach applied to hydropower projects to examine some of the negative impacts, especially by location and gender, of these projects on local communities and then identify strategies that can safeguard or enhance livelihoods of women, youth, and men in areas with hydropower projects, while also maintaining critical ecosystem services. By assessing the Bhilangana basin case, we also offer hydropower-livelihoods-irrigation nexus lessons for headwater regions across the Himalayas and globally.","[Buechler, Stephanie; Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Buechler, Stephanie; Scott, Christopher A.] Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Sen, Debashish; Khandekar, Neha] Peoples Sci Inst, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India; [Khandekar, Neha] Energy & Resources Inst TERI, Delhi 110003, India",,"Buechler, S (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Sch Geog & Dev, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.;Buechler, S (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Udall Ctr Studies Publ Policy, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",buechler@email.arizona.edu; debu_manu@yahoo.co.in; khandekar05@gmail.com; cascott@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,,,20.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2016,8.0,10,,,,,,,437,10.3390/w8100437,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8100437,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000389659200022,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study was conducted in the Ladakh region of India to evaluate the socio-cultural values of the ecosystem services provided by the mountainous region.

It was observed that the respondents identified provisioning and cultural services easily compared to regulating and supporting services. Among services, fresh water and grazing services were valued 5rating score on a Likert scale of 1-5 by more than 90% of respondents. Likewise, 80% of respondents have a 5rating score for water retention and regulation, water purification, aesthetic and recreation and ecotourism services. A similar result was observed when the priority of ecosystem services for villagers was discussed through focus group discussions. All respondents viewed freshwater, grazing, and aesthetic services as priority ecosystem services, whereas recreation and ecotourism were prioritised in four villages, water retention and regulation, and water purification in two villages. Using bivariate correlation, the study of interactions among ecosystem services (between services of the same category) demonstrated strong positive to moderate negative correlations. Similarly, the results of the Kruskal-Wallis test indicate that socio-economic factors, including gender, income, and education, have a notable impact (p < 0.05) on most of the services. This suggests that respondents' socio-economic backgrounds influence the values assigned to the services. However, the decline of crucial ecosystem services over the last two decades, as highlighted by participants in the in-depth interviews, raises alarm. Integrating socio-cultural values of ecosystem services while formulating any regional developmental policy could empower the policy-makers to take more informed, eco-friendly actions.","[Hussain, Sabir; Sharma, Sheenu; Singh, Anand Narain] Panjab Univ, Dept Bot, Soil Ecosyst & Restorat Ecol Lab, Chandigarh 160014, India",,"Singh, AN (corresponding author), Panjab Univ, Dept Bot, Soil Ecosyst & Restorat Ecol Lab, Chandigarh 160014, India.",ansingh@pu.ac.in,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2023,44.0,,,,,,,,100404,10.1016/j.ancene.2023.100404,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2023.100404,,SEP 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001083817000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

These dark, light-absorbing particles are known to exert a great melting potential on mountain cryospheric reservoirs through albedo reduction and radiative forcing. This study combines ground-based and satellite remote sensing data to identify a severe aerosol pollution episode observed simultaneously in central Tibet and on the southern side of the Himalayas during 1319 March 2009 (pre-monsoon). Trajectory calculations based on the high-resolution numerical weather prediction model COSMO are used to locate the source regions and study the mechanisms of pollution transport in the complex topography of the HTP. We detail how polluted air masses from an atmospheric brown cloud (ABC) over South Asia reach the Tibetan Plateau within a few days. Lifting and advection of polluted air masses over the great mountain range is enabled by a combination of synoptic-scale and local meteorological processes. During the days prior to the event, winds over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) are generally weak at lower levels, allowing for accumulation of pollutants and thus the formation of ABCs. The subsequent passing of synopticscale troughs leads to southwesterly flow in the middle troposphere over northern and central India, carrying the polluted air masses across the Himalayas. As the IGP is known to be a hotspot of ABCs, the cross-Himalayan transport of polluted air masses may have serious implications for the cryosphere in the HTP and impact climate on regional to global scales. Since the current study focuses on one particularly strong pollution episode, quantifying the frequency and magnitude of similar events in a climatological study is required to assess the total impact.","[Luthi, Z.

An extraordinary pollution episode with an aerosol optical depth at 500 nm (tau) of an order of magnitude higher than the baseline was further studied using ground-based and satellite remote-sensing data. The annual aerosol baseline at Nam Co is tau = 0.029, which is about half of that over the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. Sunphotometer observations at Nam Co recorded an intense spring atmospheric pollution episode, with the maximum tau of 0.42 on 16 March 2009. The episode was characterized by dominant fine particles with strong absorption. A large tau value with similar size and absorption also occurred in the Indo-Gangetic plains and South Asia, suggesting the transportation of aerosols to the Tibetan Plateau from surrounding regions. The passive satellite data showed dense plumes associated with active fires in the Himalayan foothills, the Indo-Gangetic plains, and South Asia and a thick, widespread haze piling up against the Himalayan ridges and impinging upon adjacent valleys. A pollution pool with a thick layer rich with aerosol over the Ganges Plain in Northern India, as revealed by the active satellite data, extended up to 3-5 km during this period, making it possible for the transportation of aerosols to the central Tibetan Plateau by the southwesterly wind prevailing at that level. Further studies are urgently required to identify the transport mechanism and to reveal the potential climatic impacts of aerosol transportation to the Tibetan Plateau.

P.",,,Monitoring carbon stock changes in Solan Forest Division of Indian Western Himalayas,ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"The Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) has rich forest resources but is increasingly threatened by changes in land use. It is therefore imperative to understand forest carbon budgets and ecosystem productivity in this ecologically sensitive mountain landscape. The study assessed spatial distribution and changes in forest carbon stocks of Solan Forest Division over the period 1998-2010. Forest inventory data was gathered from the Divisional Working Plan and through field enumeration. The IRS 1D (LISS-III) satellite data were preprocessed through geometric and radiometric corrections. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated from the reflectance of red and near-infrared radiation. Statistical relationships between inventory-based forest carbon stocks and NDVI were used as a basis for spatial extrapolation to the whole region. A significant relationship was observed between carbon stock and NDVI for both 1998 (R = 0.741) and 2010 (R = 0.663). The carbon density ranged from < 10.49 to 168.03 t ha(-1) (1998) and from < 11.32 to 181.23 t ha(-1) (2010). Over the period 1998-2010 although the forest area decreased, the carbon stock increased by < 0.71 to 11.49%. Imposition of felling bans, afforestation, natural ageing of secondary forests and profuse natural regeneration may be associated with the observed increase in carbon stock. The study suggested that NDVI derived from optical imageries can be utilised to assess vegetation carbon dynamics in subtropical forests of the region. Among a myriad of mitigation options, maintaining and enhancing carbon in forested landscapes remains an efficacious strategy. Similar studies in fragile ecosystems vulnerable to anthropogenic modification can facilitate robust monitoring of terrestrial carbon sequestration and its capacity in meeting emission reduction targets.","[Shah, Shipra] Fiji Natl Univ, Coll Agr Fisheries & Forestry, Dept Forestry, POB 1544,Nausori Campus, Nausori, Fiji; [Sharma, D.

Several studies have been conducted on the dynamic changes of grassland in the HKH region, but few have considered grassland net ecosystem productivity (NEP). In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the temporal and spatial changes of NEP magnitude and the influence of climate factors on the HKH region from 2001 to 2018. The NEP magnitude was obtained by calculating the difference between the net primary production (NPP) estimated by the Carnegie-Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model and the heterotrophic respiration (Rh) estimated by the geostatistical model. The results showed that the grassland ecosystem in the HKH region exhibited weak net carbon uptake with NEP values of 42.03 gC center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1), and the total net carbon sequestration was 0.077 Pg C. The distribution of NEP gradually increased from west to east, and in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, it gradually increased from northwest to southeast. The grassland carbon sources and sinks differed at different altitudes. The grassland was a carbon sink at 3000-5000 m, while grasslands below 3000 m and above 5000 m were carbon sources. Grassland NEP exhibited the strongest correlation with precipitation, and it had a lagging effect on precipitation. The correlation between NEP and the precipitation of the previous year was stronger than that of the current year. NEP was negatively correlated with temperature but not with solar radiation. The study of the temporal and spatial dynamics of NEP in the HKH region can provide a theoretical basis to help herders balance grazing and forage.","[Guo, Da; Song, Xiaoning; Hu, Ronghai; Zhu, Xinming; Cai, Shuohao; Zhang, Yanan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Guo, Da; Song, Xiaoning; Hu, Ronghai; Zhu, Xinming; Cai, Shuohao; Zhang, Yanan; Cui, Xiaoyong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Yanshan Earth Crit Zone & Surface Fluxes Res Stn, Beijing 101408, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Yazhen] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cui, Xiaoyong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,"Song, XN (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Song, XN (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Yanshan Earth Crit Zone & Surface Fluxes Res Stn, Beijing 101408, Peoples R China.",guoda181@mails.ucas.ac.cn; songxn@ucas.ac.cn; huronghai@ucas.ac.cn; zhuxinming19@mails.ucas.ac.cn; jiangyz@lreis.ac.cn; caishuohao19@mails.ucas.ac.cn; zhangyanan204@mails.ucas.ac.cn; cuixy@ucas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,11.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2021,13.0,6,,,,,,,1180,10.3390/rs13061180,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13061180,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000651929100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A study was thus conducted to assess the effect of grassland, forest, agricultural and eroded land uses on soil aggregation, bulk density, pore size distribution and water retention and transmission characteristics. The soil samples were analysed for aggregate stability by shaking under water and water drop stability by using single simulated raindrop technique. The water-stable aggregates (WSA) >2mm were highest (173per cent) in the surface layers of grassland, whereas the micro-aggregates (WSA<025mm) were highest in eroded soils. The water drop stability followed the similar trend. It decreased with the increase in aggregate size. Being lowest in eroded soils, the soil organic carbon also showed an adverse effect of past land-use change. The bulk density was highest in eroded lands, being significantly higher for the individual aggregates than that of the bulk soils. The macroporosity (>150 mu m) of eroded soils was significantly (p<005) lower than that of grassland and forest soils. The grassland soils retained the highest amount of water. Significant (p<005) effects of land use, soil depth and their interaction were observed in water retention at different soil water suctions. Eroded soils had significantly (p<005) lower water retention than grassland and forest soils. The saturated hydraulic conductivity and maximum water-holding capacity of eroded soils were sufficiently lower than those of forest and grassland soils. These indicated a degradation of soil physical attributes due to the conversion of natural ecosystems to farming system and increased erosion hazards in the lower Himalayan region of north-west India.

The AS model introduces the law of the matter conservation and builds a bridge between tectonic uplift and erosion. In recent decade, AS has been widely used in the longitudinal profile simulation of bedrock and alluvial rivers, but many applications have failed to carefully consider the mechanism, fitting effect, and applicability of the resulting models, resulting in unsatisfactory simulation results. In order to verify the channel profile analysis capability of the two models, the study compared the theoretical basis and the applications of channel fitting and knickpoint identification made in the Gyirong Watershed in the middle Himalayan Orogen. It is believed that if the river meets the equilibrium condition, both models reflect the law of the matter conservation, instead of being limited to the AS. The results show that, for rivers with different equilibrium status, the two have different numerical responses on 7 bedrock rivers. The AS model has a comparative advantage in river channels with a higher degree of equilibrium, while the DS model is more suitable for longer rivers in a disequilibrium state. Finally, we applied DS model to the Gyirong Zangbo River in order to analyze the numerical characteristics of the knickzone parameters. It is found that the distribution of concave-convex intersection on the profile corresponds to the variation of the fast and slow erosion rate. This characteristic reflects the interaction between the river erosion and sedimentation in the Gyirong Watershed and is sensitive to the formation processes of the differentiated climate patterns over the past 2 Ma","[Chen, Lu; Ran, Qinghong] Chengdu Normal Univ, Inst Humanity Resources Western China, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lu] Inst Sci & Technol Informat Tibet Autonomous Reg, Lhasa 850001, Peoples R China; [Kan, Aike; Deng, Guiping] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Tourism & Urban Rural Planning, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Qin, Jianxiong] Southwest Minzu Univ, Coll Hist Culture & Tourism, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [He, Jun] Hydrol & Water Resources Survey Bur Tibet Autonom, Shannan Branch, Sharman 856000, Peoples R China",,"Kan, AK (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Tourism & Urban Rural Planning, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",kanaike@cdut.edu.cn,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2020,15.0,2,,,,,429,441,,10.26471/cjees/2020/015/142,http://dx.doi.org/10.26471/cjees/2020/015/142,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000565086800015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The conventional methods for measuring Chl and N contents in leaves are destructive, costly, time-consuming, and do not allow repetitive measurement of the same sample. The Damask Rose (Rosa damascena Mill) is an important aromatic crop in the western Himalaya region in India. Generally, flower yield and oil yield of the Damask rose are correlated with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels in the leaf at the bud development stage. The dynamics of N within the rose plant have not been reported clearly. Thus, there is a pressing need for non-destructive techniques to estimate Chl and N content in the leaf of the Damask rose. Our objective was to establish an appropriate mathematical relationship between the Chl content index (CCI) value and the total Chl/N contents for non-destructive estimation of total Chl and N in the leaf of the Damask rose. The regression models were developed with destructively measured parameters (total Chl and N) as the dependent variable and a parameter derived from CCM-200 as the independent variable (CCI). We found that polynomial regression models are suitable for non-destructive estimation of total Chl, and the model predicted values were very close to traditionally measured values with a root mean square prediction error (RMSEp) less than 0.20 mg g(-1) of Chl. In the case of N estimation, a power regression model was appropriate with lowest Akaike's information criteria (AIC) and root mean square validated error (RMSEv) value.

(222)Radon concentration varied from 0.2 to 38.5 Bq L-1 with an average value of 8.9 Bq L-1. The radon concentration in 19 groundwater samples (32% of total sites) exceeded the permissible limits of 11 Bq L-1 set by USEPA. This information could be of vital importance to health professionals in Kashmir who are researching on the incidence of lung cancers in the region given the fact that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancers after smoking worldwide.","[Nazir, Salik; Simnani, Shakeel; Masood, Sajad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Phys, Hazratbal Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Sahoo, B.

The impact indicators for the region were identified and assessed by qualitative and quantitative analysis of field observations. The observations indicated the aggravation of traffic congestion, atmospheric pollution, undisposed solid waste, water scarcity and infrastructure unavailability as the prevalent issues, especially during the peak tourist months. The extent of the consequential damage to the environment was evaluated by conducting an assessment of tourism-induced human disturbance on the natural landscape of the town. Slope, slope aspect, vegetation cover, road network and drainage network were incorporated as the determining landscape attributes to prepare thematic maps of landscape quality (perceivable intrinsic properties) and landscape fragility (vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances) using GIS technique. An absorption capacity map was finally prepared to characterize the study area into regions of different conservation needs.

The Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA) was used to compare ecosystem services between two alternative states of the site (protection or lack of protection with consequent changed land use) to estimate the net consequences of protection. We estimated that lack of protection would have substantially reduced the annual ecosystem service flow, including a 74% reduction in the value of greenhouse gas sequestration, 60% reduction in carbon storage, 94% reduction in nature-based recreation, and 88% reduction in water quality. The net monetary benefit of the park was estimated at $11 million year(-1). We conclude that: (1) simplified cost-benefit analysis between alternative states can be usefully employed to determine the ecosystem service consequences of land-use change, but monetary benefits should be subject to additional sensitivity analysis; (2) both biophysical indicators and monetary values can be standardised using rose plots, to illustrate the magnitude of synergies and trade-offs among the services; and (3) continued biodiversity protection measures can preserve carbon stock, although the benefit of doing so remains virtual unless an effective governance option is established to realise the monetary values.

In this study, we utilized monthly time-series data to assess the accuracy of the ANN and SWAT models. A comparative analysis based on prediction accuracy was conducted, and the results indicated that the ANN model demonstrated excellent performance in forecasting peak flow, whereas the SWAT model showed better outcomes when simulating low-flow values. Our findings reveal that the SWAT model will achive the highest Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) values during calibration and validation stages. The study showed that ANN-based modeling is time and computationally efficient, does not require extensive studies, is not limited by the nature or quantity of inputs, and produces results equivalent to those generated by process-based models.

The presence of active faults in the subsurface and associated deformation is another reason for active ground subsidence. The outcomes of the current study validate that the study area is currently undergoing active subsurface deformation caused by both endogenic as well as exogenic processes.

The accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) assisted C-14 dating of the sediment core showed C-14 age reversals related to occasional disturbances. The vertical distribution of various fractions revealed increased concentrations of organic carbon (OC), OM, and nutrients (N and P) in the upper part of the sediment core, largely related to increased anthropogenic inputs from the catchment areas during recent decades. Further, the low to high C/N ratio (1.3-36.4) suggests a combination of both the autochthonous and allochthonous inputs as the major contributors of OM to the wetland ecosystem. The linear regression model showed significant (p < 0.05) positive and negative relationships among various analyzed parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) resulted in three principal components (PCs) accounting for a cumulative variance of 83.6%.

The study of glacier facies in the Himalayas has gained momentum in the last decade owing to the implications imposed by these facies on the melt characteristics of the glaciers. Some of the most commonly reported surface facies in the Himalayas are snow, ice, ice mixed debris, and debris. The precision of the techniques used to extract glacier facies is of high importance, as the result of many cryospheric studies and economic reforms rely on it. An assessment of a customized semi-automated protocol against conventional and advanced mapping algorithms for mapping glacier surface facies is presented in this study. Customized spectral index ratios (SIRs) are developed for effective extraction of surface facies using thresholding in an object-based environment. This method was then tested on conventional and advanced classification algorithms for an evaluation of the mapping accuracy for five glaciers located in the Himalayas, using very high-resolution WorldView-2 imagery. The results indicate that the object-based image analysis (OBIA) based semi-automated SIR approach achieved a higher average overall accuracy of 87.33% (kappa = 0.85) than the pixel-based image analysis (PBIA) approach. Among the conventional methods, the Maximum Likelihood performed the best, with an overall accuracy of 78.71% (kappa = 0.75). The Constrained Energy Minimization, with an overall accuracy of 68.76% (kappa = 0.63), was the best performer of the advanced algorithms. The advanced methods greatly underperformed in this study. The proposed SIRs show a promise in the mapping of minor features such as crevasses and in the discrimination between ice-mixed debris and debris. We have efficiently mapped surface glacier facies independently of short-wave infrared bands (SWIR). There is a scope for the transferability of the proposed SIRs and their performance in varying scenarios.","[Jawak, Shridhar D.; Wankhede, Sagar F.; Luis, Alvarinho J.] Govt India, Minist Earth Sci, ESSO, NCPOR, Vasco Da Gama 403804, Goa, India; [Jawak, Shridhar D.] Svalbard Sci Ctr, SIOS Knowledge Ctr, Svalbard Integrated Arctic Earth Observing Syst S, POB 156, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway; [Wankhede, Sagar F.] Mangalore Univ, Dept Marine Geol, Mangalagangothri 574199, Karnataka, India",,"Wankhede, SF (corresponding author), Govt India, Minist Earth Sci, ESSO, NCPOR, Vasco Da Gama 403804, Goa, India.;Wankhede, SF (corresponding author), Mangalore Univ, Dept Marine Geol, Mangalagangothri 574199, Karnataka, India.",swankhede436@gmail.com; swankhede436@gmail.com; alvluis@ncaor.gov.in,,,,,,,,11.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 2,2019,11.0,10,,,,,,,1207,10.3390/rs11101207,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11101207,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000480524800065,View Full Record in Web of Science

Otherwise, HRES system may become oversize or undersize without vigorous load and resource assessment. Oversizing or undersizing may also affect the economic viability of such a system in terms of higher energy generation cost and lower reliability. Proper resource estimation for hybrid energy system not only provides sustainable energy but also improves reliability and stability. In the present study, sizing optimization of a hybrid energy system, consisting of hydro-solar-battery-diesel, has been carried out. To begin with, three villages in the Chanju Panchayat of district Chamba in Western Himalayan Himachal Pradesh (HP) has been considered based on the local resource availability (corresponding to hydro and solar potential). Sizing optimization of the hybrid system (at these villages) is carried out using particle swarm optimization (PSO) method with energy index ration 1. In the designing of HRES, the input parameters such as available solar radiation and hydro discharge has been used. These parameters are estimated by using artificial neural network (ANN) and hydrology estimation techniques. Addition to the renewable energy fraction based on the present energy demand of selected villages, the cost of energy (COE), net present cost, and emissions of carbon dioxide from diesel generator are also estimated. It is worth mentioning that the use of Diesel generator is included to deal with the intermittency of the renewable energy resources.

A great number of lakes are distributed in the southern slope area of the central Himalayas; however, research concerning the hydrochemical processes of these lakes is still insufficient. Herein, we present a comprehensive study on the water chemistry of the lake waters and the inlet stream waters from Rara Lake in western Nepal based upon samples collected in November 2018. The pH, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a), water temperature, electric conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured in situ, and the concentrations of major ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Cl-, SO42-, and NO3-) were analyzed in the laboratory. The results revealed that the water in Rara Lake is slightly alkaline, with pH values ranging from 7.6-7.98. The cations, in decreasing order of concentration in the lake water, are Ca2+ >Mg2+ >K+ >Na+ with average concentrations of 20.64 mg center dot L-1, 11.78 mg center dot L-1, 1.48 mg center dot L-1 and 0.72 mg center dot L-1, respectively; the order and concentrations for the anions is HCO3->SO42->Cl->NO3-, with average concentrations of 122.15 mg center dot L-1, 2.15 mg center dot L-1, 0.46 mg center dot L-1 and 0.55 mg center dot L-1, respectively. The dominant cation and anion in the lake water are Ca2+ and HCO3(-), and they account for 48.14% and 71.8% of the totals, respectively. The range of lake water TDS is from 95 mg center dot L-1 to 98 mg center dot L-1, with an average of 96.85 mg center dot L-1. The high ratio of (Ca2+ + Mg2+) to total cations and the low ratio of (Na+ + K+) to total cations indicate that Rara Lake receives ions from rock weathering, especially from carbonate rocks. Similarly, Gibbs boomerang diagrams and Piper diagrams also support the hydrochemistry of Rara Lake as being dominated by rock-weathering patterns. Likewise, other statistical analysis tools, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and correlation strongly suggest the dominance of weathering of calcium and magnesium bicarbonate rocks as the major source of ions in Rara Lake. However, several traces of anthropogenic inputs into the lake were noticed, and the hypolimnion in the lake appears to be oxygen deficient, which may not be an issue at present but cannot be ignored in the future.","[Kaphle, Binija; Wang, Jun-bo; Kai, Jin-lei; Lyu, Xin-miao; Adhikari, Subash] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jun-bo; Lyu, Xin-miao] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Kaphle, Binija; Kai, Jin-lei; Adhikari, Subash] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Paudayal, Khum Narayan] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Geol, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal",,"Wang, JB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Wang, JB (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",binijakaphle1@itpcas.ac.cn; wangjb@itpcas.ac.cn; kaijinlei@itpcas.ac.cn; lvxm@itpcas.ac.cn; khum99@gmail.com; sadhikari@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,5.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2021,18.0,1,,,,,141,158,,10.1007/s11629-019-5910-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-019-5910-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000607413000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

An analysis of the H-2 and O-18 isotope composition of daily precipitation collected along the southern foothills of the Himalayas, combined with extensive backward trajectory modelling, was used to gain deeper insight into the mechanisms controlling the isotopic composition of precipitation and the origin of atmospheric moisture and precipitation during ISM and WD periods. Daily precipitation samples were collected during the period from September 2008 to December 2011 at six stations, extending from Srinagar in the west (Kashmir state) to Dibrugarh in the east (Assam state). In total, 548 daily precipitation samples were collected and analysed for their stable isotope composition. It is suggested that the gradual reduction in the H-2 and O-18 content of precipitation in the study region, progressing from delta O-18 values close to zero down to ca. -10% in the course of ISM evolution, stems from regional, large-scale recycling of moisture-driven monsoonal circulation. Superimposed on this general trend are short-term fluctuations of the isotopic composition of rainfall, which might have stem from local effects such as enhanced convective activity and the associated higher degree of rainout of moist air masses (local amount effect), the partial evaporation of raindrops, or the impact of isotopically heavy moisture generated in evapotranspiration processes taking place in the vicinity of rainfall sampling sites. Seasonal footprint maps constructed for three stations representing the western, central and eastern portions of the Himalayan region indicate that the influence of monsoonal circulation reaches the western edges of the Himalayan region. While the characteristic imprint of monsoonal air masses (increase of monthly rainfall amount) can be completely absent in the western Himalayas, the onset of the ISM period in this region is still clearly visible in the isotopic composition of daily precipitation. A characteristic feature of daily precipitation collected during the WD period is the gradual increase of H-2 and O-18 content, reaching positive delta H-2 and delta O-18 values towards the end of the period. This trend can be explained by the growing importance of moisture of continental origin as a source of daily precipitation. High deuterium-excess (d-excess) values of daily rainfall recorded at the monitoring stations (38 cases in total, range from 20.6 to 44.0 %) are attributed to moisture of continental origin released into the atmosphere during the evaporation of surface water bodies and/or soil water evaporation.","[Jeelani, Ghulam] Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Deshpande, Rajendrakumar D.] Phys Res Lab, Geosci Div, Ahmadabad 380009, Gujarat, India; [Galkowski, Michal; Rozanski, Kazimierz] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Phys & Appl Comp Sci, PL-30059 Krakow, Poland",,"Jeelani, G (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Earth Sci, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",geojeelani@gmail.com,,,,,,,,49.0,51.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 22,2018,18.0,12,,,,,8789,8805,,10.5194/acp-18-8789-2018,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-8789-2018,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000435954400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, analysis of the social, economic and environmental impacts of community forestry is often limited, restricted to a narrow set of benefits (e.g. non-timber forest products) and rarely makes comparisons with alternative land-use options (e.g. agriculture). This study, conducted at Phulchoki Mountain Forest Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) in the Kathmandu Valley, used methods from the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-based Assessment (TESSA) to compare multiple ecosystem service values (including carbon storage, greenhouse gas sequestration, water provision, water quality, harvested wild goods, cultivated goods and nature-based recreation) provided by the site in its current state and a plausible alternative state in which community forestry had not been implemented. We found that outcomes from community forestry have been favourable for most stakeholders, at most scales, for most services and for important biodiversity at the site. However, not all ecosystem services can be maximised simultaneously, and impacts of land-use decisions on service beneficiaries appear to differ according to socio-economic factors.

Nowadays, the physico-chemical properties of aerosols are being measured using space as well as ground-based sensors. Although tremendous progress has been made to improve observation systems, yet till date our understanding of physico-chemical properties of aerosol is limited. A review of available literature indicates that the surface cooling effect of aerosol is strengthened with the increase in absorbing aerosol particles in the atmosphere in response to warming. This effect might change the microphysical properties of the clouds and in due time climate. The current state of knowledge about aerosol processes where it affects climate during interaction with clouds is limited. Because aerosol processes are too complex and couldn't represent accurately in global climate models, so it is crucial in terms of predicting climate. It is therefore pertinent that future research needs to focus on a detailed understanding of physico-chemical properties of aerosols and underlying aerosol processes particularly aerosol-cloud interactions and their effect on climate.","[Kuniyal, Jagdish Chandra] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India; [Guleria, Raj Paul] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Himachal Reg Ctr, Mohal Kullu 175126, Himachal Prades, India",,"Kuniyal, JC (corresponding author), GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm & Sustainabl, Almora 263643, Uttarakhand, India.",jckuniyal@gmail.com,,,,,,,,42.0,46.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2019,130.0,,,,,,45,54,,10.1016/j.jaerosci.2018.12.010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2018.12.010,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000458786000005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study aims to map the forest canopy height and aboveground biomass (AGB) by integrating Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and Sentinel data using Random Forest (RF), a machine learning algorithm in a part of the Pauri Garhwal district of Uttarakhand, India. The vegetation types/land uses of the study area were mapped using Sentinel-2 data with an overall accuracy of 91% using the RF algorithm. GEDI was integrated with 16 texture and 2 backscatter variables derived from Sentinel-1 SAR data to map the height of the forest canopy. A combination of LiDAR and SAR variables was found to be efficient in predicting forest canopy height. The forest canopy height map was validated using field-measured canopy height values from outside the LiDAR footprints with an R2 of 0.81, an RMSE of 1.61 m, and a %RMSE of 8.20. The modelled canopy height was further used with Sentinel-2 data to estimate forest AGB in the study area. The forest AGB was mapped by integrating field-measured AGB with Sentinel-2 data-derived spectral and texture variables and modelled forest canopy height derived from GEDI and Sentinel-1 data, using the RF model. The combination of spectral, texture, and height variables was able to predict the spatial distribution of AGB with an R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 22.05 Mg ha-1, and %RMSE = 15.11%. The study highlighted that a synergistic approach involving multi-sensor data can effectively predict the forest canopy height and AGB. It also highlighted the utility of machine learning algorithm in mapping forest biophysical parameters.

Once abundant in northern Pakistan, the Himalayan brown bear (Ursus arctos isabellinus) has been exterminated in most of its former distribution range. It presently occurs sparsely, in small populations, the Deosai National Park supporting the largest isolate. This decline might imply a reduction in genetic diversity, compromising the survival of the population. Using a combination of fecal DNA analysis and field data, our study aimed at assessing the size and genetic status of the Deosai population and give guidelines for its conservation and management. Using fecal genetic analysis, we estimated the population to be 40-50 bears, which compares well with the field census of 38 bears. The northern Pakistani brown bear population may have undergone an approximate 200-300-fold decrease during the last thousand years, probably due to glaciations and the influence of growing human population. However, in spite of the presence of a bottleneck genetic signature, the Deosai population has a moderate level of genetic diversity and is not at immediate risk of inbreeding depression. Gene flow might exist with adjacent populations. We recommend careful monitoring of this population in the future both with field observations and genetic analyses, including sampling of adjacent populations to assess incoming gene flow. The connectivity with adjacent populations in Pakistan and India will be of prime importance for the longterm survival of Deosai bears. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Three permanent plots were established in natural forest stands along an altitudinal gradient, three replicates were collected seasonally from each site, and microbial biomass (C, N and P) were determined by a fumigation extraction method. Microbial biomass C, N and P decreased significantly (p < 0.01, correlation coefficient 0.985, 0.963, 0.948, respectively) with increasing altitude having maximum values during rainy season and minimum values during winter season. Microbial biomass C, N and P showed positive correlations with silt particles, water holding capacity, bulk density, soil moisture, organic C, total N and P and negative correlations with sand particles, porosity and soil pH. Microbial biomass C was strongly associated with soil microbial N (r = 0.80, p < 0.01) and P (r = 0.89, p < 0.01) content and soil microbial biomass N and P also showed a strong linear relationship (r = 0.92, p < 0.01). Soil microbial biomass exhibited weak seasonality and was highly influenced by altitude and abiotic variables. The significantly high microbial C, N and P during the rainy season (p < 0.01) and low microbial biomass during the winter season may be due to higher immobilization of nutrients from decomposing litter by microbes as the decomposition rate of litter and microbial activity are at their peak during the rainy period. The microbial C:N ratio indicated that soil fertility is influenced by species composition.

They were analyzed for ambient particulate-bound Hg (PBM) using thermal desorption combined with cold vapor atomic spectroscopy. In our knowledge, it is the first study of ambient PMB in the Kathmandu Valley and the surrounding broader Himalayan foothill region. The average concentration of PBM over the entire sampling period of a year was found to be 850.5 (+/- 962.8) pg m(-3) in the Kathmandu Valley. This is comparable to those values reported in the polluted cities of China and significantly higher than those observed in most of urban areas in Asia and other regions of world. The daily average Hg contents in TSP (PBM/TSP) ranges from 269.7 to 7613.0 ng g(-1) with an average of 2586.0 (+/- 2072.1) ng g(-1), indicating the high enrichment of Hg in TSP. The average concentrations of PBM were higher in the winter and pre-monsoon season than in the monsoon and post-monsoon season. The temporal variations in the strength of anthropogenic emission sources combined with other influencing factors, such as ambient temperature and the removal of atmospheric aerosols by wet scavenging are attributable to the seasonal variations of PBM. The considerably high dry deposition flux of PBM estimated by using a theoretical model was 135 mu g m(-2) yr(-1) at the Kathmandu Valley.

Understanding the response of crop yields to soil erosion is vital in assessing agriculture's vulnerability to erosion. However, these effects are difficult to quantify. The study presents a quantitative relationship between soil erosion and soil quality and productivity of rainfed wheat (Triticum aestivum) by comparing field plots with different degrees of erosion in some sub-tropical alfisols in the Doon Valley region of India. By comparing the topsoil depth with the reference site as the control, erosion severity was classified into different phases such as slight, moderate, severe, and very severe. A quantitative, weighted additive model was used to evaluate soil quality for different phases of erosion using soil clay content, water holding capacity, soil aggregate, soil organic carbon, pH, CEC, total N, available P, and available K. The synthesis of long-term experimental data revealed that the mean soil erosion rate varied from 5.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in slightly eroded plots to 33.4 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in very severely eroded plots. Compared with the reference forest, the soil organic carbon (SOC) declined by 81.4% and water holding capacity by 31% in severely eroded soils. A substantial loss of total N, extractable P, and available K was also observed. Water stable aggregates (WSA) decreased from 86% to 12.6%, and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) from 25 to 12.6 c mol((+)) kg(-1). The soil quality index was 0.7 in slightly eroded compared with 0.4 in severely eroded soil. Similarly, the sustainable yield index for wheat was 0.9 and 0.6 for slightly and severely eroded soils, respectively.

This study provides novel insights into atmospheric phosphorus based on the study of total suspended particulate matter at the Qomolangma station. Contrary to the prevailing assumptions, we show that biomass burning (BB), not mineral dust, dominates total dissolved phosphorus (TDP, bioavailable) deposition in this arid region, especially during spring. While total phosphorus is mainly derived from dust (77% annually), TDP is largely affected by the transport of regional biomass-burning plumes from South Asia. During BB pollution episodes, TDP causing springtime TDP fluxes alone accounts for 43% of the annual budget. This suggests that BB outweighs dust in supplying bioavailable phosphorus, a critical nutrient, required to sustain Himalayas' ecological functions. Overall, this first-hand field evidence refines the regional and global phosphorus budget by demonstrating that BB emission, while still unrecognized, is a significant source of P, even in the remote mountains of the Himalayas. It also reveals the heterogeneity of atmospheric phosphorus deposition in that region, which will help predict changes in the impacted ecosystems as the deposition patterns vary.","[Diao, Xing; Wan, Xin; Gao, Shaopeng; Pei, Qiaomin; Wu, Guangming; Wang, Xiaoping; Cong, Zhiyuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Diao, Xing; Kang, Shichang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100039, Peoples R China; [Widory, David] Univ Quebec Montreal UQAM, Geotop, Montreal, PQ H2X 3Y7, Canada; [Ram, Kirpa] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Environm & Sustainable Dev, Varanasi 221005, India; [Du, Enzai] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Kang, Shichang] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhong; Cong, Zhiyuan] Tibet Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China",,"Cong, ZY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, State Key Lab Tibetan Plateau Earth Syst Environm, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Cong, ZY (corresponding author), Tibet Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China.",zhiyuancong@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 28,2023,58.0,1,,,,,459,467,,10.1021/acs.est.3c07670,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c07670,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001139505500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, this study aimed to assess effect of the predominant horticulture-based land uses on soil fertility and health in mid and high hills of NWHR. Soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected, analyzed for different soil chemical attributes (pH, electrical conductivity, organic C, available primary-, secondary-, and micro-nutrients), and compared across five key land uses: perennial grass (PG), peach orchard (PO), apple orchard (AO), field vegetable farming (VF), and protected vegetable farming (PV). Soils of the investigated land uses were neutral to near neutral in soil reaction (6.3-6.8) except field vegetable and protected vegetable farming. Amount of soil organic C and labile organic C was significantly higher (p <= 0.05) in soils of apple orchards (18.6 g kg(-1) and 687.3 mg kg(-1), respectively) and peach orchards (20.4 g kg(-1) and 731.3 mg kg(-1), respectively) over others. An abrupt and significant increase in Olsen-P was recorded in soils of field vegetable farming (17.1 mg kg(-1)) and protected vegetable farming (13.0 mg kg(-1)), which shifted their nutrient index (NI) of P in to high category (>= 2.33). The concentration of mineralizable-N in soil was statistically at par in soils under perennial grass and fruit orchards, while protected vegetable farming showed maximum soil mineralizable-N content (115.5 mg kg(-1)) and NI of nitrogen (1.83). The NI was in high category (>= 2.33) for copper, iron, and manganese in majority of the land uses. In view of the results, temperate fruit-tree based land uses are benign in up-keeping soil fertility and soil health, and needs promotion on large scale. Additionally, policies to create incentives for the build-up of soil organic matter and replenishment of the depleted soil macro and micro nutrients in vegetable-farmed lands are warranted.","[Debnath, Sovan; Narayan, Raj; Kumar, Anil; Kishor, Arun] ICAR Cent Inst Temperate Hort, Naini Tal, India; [Kumar, Anil] ICAR Directorate Mushroom Res, Solan, India; [Singh, Desh Beer] ICAR Cent Inst Temperate Hort, Srinagar, India",,"Debnath, S (corresponding author), ICAR Cent Inst Temperate Hort, Reg Stn Mukteshwar, Naini Tal 263138, Uttarakhand, India.",sovan_t97@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 3,2020,66.0,3,,,,,489,498,,10.1080/00380768.2020.1753110,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00380768.2020.1753110,,MAY 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000532439000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, many supplement their meager subsistence earnings by collecting and selling plant material for use in herbal medicine. This material is wild-harvested, but collectors seem not to fully appreciate the potential value of the plant material they collect nor the longterm impact their collection has on local plant populations. A model project supported by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) persuaded small-scale farmers in four different villages to use some of their land for cultivating traditionally wild-harvested species of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) with high market value. The farmers were provided seeds or rhizomes of five MAPs and asked to monitor their germination and growth on 25 m(2) plots during a 12 month period. At the end of the study, growth and yield data from the four localities were compared and economic analyses conducted to determine the profitability of the species based on yields, prevailing market prices, and costs of production. Five of the cultivated species were subsequently marketed and their value evaluated: Sesamum indicum, Linum usitatissimum, Ocimum basilicum, Nigella sativa and Viola pilosa. The MAPs V. pilosa and O. basilicum were the most profitable, whereas Nigella sativa was the least profitable because of its low germination rate. The net income from all but Nigella was higher than that would have been earned by planting the same area with the predominant cereals or tomatoes. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility and financial benefits of cultivating MAPs as a cash crop, this model study identified a number of additional steps that would increase the benefits of MAPs cultivation in this area. A combination of specialized education, market infrastructure development and a small loans program would enable farmers to increase their agricultural income without damaging the area's plant diversity.","[Sher, Hassan] Univ Swat, Ctr Plant Sci & Biodivers, Mingora 19130, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan; [Barkworth, Mary E.] Utah State Univ, Dept Biol, Intermt Herbarium, Logan, UT 84322 USA",,"Sher, H (corresponding author), Univ Swat, Ctr Plant Sci & Biodivers, Mingora 19130, Khyber Pakhtunk, Pakistan.",hassan.botany@gmail.com; mary.barkworth@usu.edu,,,,,,,,12.0,12.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2015,12.0,5,,,,,1292,1301,,10.1007/s11629-014-3247-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-014-3247-2,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000362582200020,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dry deciduous forests in the tropics have been undervalued because of their low timber production compared to temperate and boreal forests. In order to quantify the current significance of Pakistan's tropical dry deciduous forests in relation to ecological variables and anthropogenic threats, a broad phytosociological survey was conducted. In the study area, a total of 140 species of woody plants belonging to 52 families were identified. The cluster analysis depicts the distribution of nine plant communities in five clusters, in which Dodonaea viscosa-Acacia modesta-Dulbergia sissoo community was the most dominant community, showing cosmopolitan distribution in the study area. The results are further authenticated by DCA and CCA analyses, which indicate that altitude, precipitation, and temperature are the most important factors influencing the distribution and composition of tropical dry deciduous forests along the Himalayan foothills. In the study area, an annual fuelwood consumption of 270.38 tons was recorded. It was discovered that high-altitude forests were subject to extensive tree harvesting, overgrazing, browsing, and high fuelwood consumption. In addition, these forests have a low regeneration rate from 4.5 to 4.8 seedlings/quadrat, due to extensive human activities. Remarkable differences in the anthropogenic pressure and disturbances were found in the protected and unprotected forests. Based on our findings, we recommend that: (i) Immediate management intervention and an in-situ conservation strategy must be implemented in areas exposed to high levels of anthropogenic threats. (ii) Unsustainable grazing and fuelwood collection must be managed, and high-threat areas must be immediately prohibited. (iii) The local populace must be made aware of the grave consequences of anthropogenic disturbances, and a collaborative management strategy must be implemented.","[Alam, Naveed; Ahmad, Bilal] Univ Swat, Inst Agr Sci & Forestry, Charbagh 19120, Pakistan; [Bohnett, Eve] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Zafar, Muhammad; Khan, Shujaul Mulk] Quaid i Azam Univ, Dept Plant Sci, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Sher, Hassan; Ahmad, Mushtaq; Ullah, Zahid; Ali, Ahmad; Syed, Kashmala] Univ Swat, Ctr Plant Sci & Biodivers, Charbagh 19120, Pakistan; [Ramadan, Mohamed Fawzy] Umm Al Qura Univ, Fac Appl Med Sci, Dept Clin Nutr, Mecca 24382, Saudi Arabia",,"Ahmad, B (corresponding author), Univ Swat, Inst Agr Sci & Forestry, Charbagh 19120, Pakistan.;Bohnett, E (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",evebohnett@yahoo.com; bilalforester89@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2023,15.0,3,,,,,,,2829,10.3390/su15032829,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15032829,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000929631700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, quantitative evaluations of the interplay between SC and these determinants as well as underlying possible link networks, are uncommon. Using the data set of SC along with soil properties at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths from 135 plots under three coniferous forests, we aimed to ascertain SC heterogeneity and to elucidate how these interactions affect the SC storage, operating data-driven models (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator [LASSO] regression and structural equation modeling [SEM]) to identify the dominant explanatory factors affecting the distribution of SC in Kashmir Himalayan forests. Average SC stocks at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depth intervals range from 32.41 Mg ha(-1) in sub-alpine (SA) forest to 48.50 Mg ha(-1) in mixed conifer (MC) forest. The findings show that SC declines significantly from 0 - 10 cm to 10-20 cm strata, consistent with other soil physico-chemical determinants other than bulk density. SEM renders better model fit (0-10 cm: R-2 = 0.61; 10-20cm: R-2 = 0.46) with lesser uncertainties compared to LASSO (0-10 cm: R2 = 0.55; 10-20cm: R-2 = 0.37). Soil properties and topography play a key role in modulating SC stocks, with total nitrogen (TN), soil moisture (SM), and elevation being principal drivers with contrasting effects on SC storage, while climate and vegetation parameters are of lesser influence. The relative effect of majority of explanatory drivers reduces with depth while that of temperature increases. Our analyses indicate that shifts in floristic composition could have long-lasting implications on soil structure and C storage, providing valuable data for C sink management.","[Dar, Ashaq Ahmad; Parthasarathy, Narayanaswamy] Pondicherry Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India",,"Parthasarathy, N (corresponding author), Pondicherry Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Pondicherry 605014, India.",nparthasarathypu@gmail.com,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 15,2023,330.0,,,,,,,,117147,10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.117147,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.117147,,JAN 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000914953900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Maximum Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) values on 19 October exceeded two at various locations in Pakistan (Sialkot = 2.56, Faisalabad = 2.67) and India (Ambala = 2.03, Amritsar = 3.4, Ludhiana = 4.29). Maximum AOD values recorded on 20 October were slightly lower in parts of Pakistan (Lahore = 2.5) and India (Gurdaspur = 1.89, New Delhi = 1.90, Batala = 2.89, Bathinda = 1.89, Kanpur = 1.6). Data for aerosol properties such as Volume Size Distributions (VSD), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), Refractive Index (RI), and ASYmmetry parameter (ASY) suggest that fine mode aerosols were predominant relative to coarse mode aerosols during the haze episode. The dominant aerosol types were classified by analyzing AOD vs. Angstrom Exponent (AE) and Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE) vs. Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE). The results revealed that during the haze episode, the prevailing aerosol types were biomass burning and urban/industrial aerosol.

The UVAI shows increasing trend at the rate of 0.1409, 0.1124, 0.1224, 0.1015, 0.1242 and 0.2054 per year over Lahore, Karachi, Kanpur, New-Delhi, Varanasi, and Dhaka with maximum UVAI of 5.55, 4.47, 4.51, 4.99, 4.61 and 4.65 respectively during the study period. The anthropogenic productivity analysis reveals that primary industry and secondary industry contributes in lowering UVAI values whereas tertiary industry, energy consumption and gross domestic products increase aerosols loading in South Asia. Moreover, HYSPLIT cluster analysis further reveals the localized and trans-boundary sources of absorbing aerosols over the selected cities.","[Nawaz, Hasan; Tariq, Salman; ul Haq, Zia; Mehmood, Usman] Univ Punjab, Ctr Remote Sensing, Natl Ctr GIS & Space Applicat, Remote Sensing GIS & Climat Res Lab, New Campus, Lahore, Pakistan; [Nawaz, Hasan] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth Atmospher & Life Sci, Ctr Atmospher Chem, Wollongong, NSW, Australia",,"Nawaz, H (corresponding author), Univ Punjab, Ctr Remote Sensing, Natl Ctr GIS & Space Applicat, Remote Sensing GIS & Climat Res Lab, New Campus, Lahore, Pakistan.;Nawaz, H (corresponding author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth Atmospher & Life Sci, Ctr Atmospher Chem, Wollongong, NSW, Australia.",hasan92nawaz@gmail.com,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2023,16.0,12,,,,,2553,2577,,10.1007/s11869-023-01423-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11869-023-01423-z,,SEP 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001062135400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Snow cover on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) provides vital water sources in western China and Himalayan regions, in addition to its weather and climate significance. The massive high mountain topography of the TP is the main condition for the presence and persistence of snow cover on the plateau at the mid-low latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). However, how the mountain topography controls snow-cover distribution on the TP remains largely unclear, and the relationship is not well quantified. Here, the spatial distribution and the topographic controls of snow cover on the TP are examined based on snow cover frequency (SCF) derived from MODIS snow cover product (MOD10A2 v005) and digital elevation model (DEM) data. The results show that snow cover on the TP is spatially unevenly distributed, and that it is characterized by rich snow and high SCF on the interior and the surrounding high mountain ranges, with less snow and low SCF in inland basins and river valleys. Snow cover on the TP presents elevation dependence: the higher the altitude, the higher the SCF, the longer the snow cover duration, and the more stable the intra-annual variation. The annual mean SCF below 3000 m above sea level (m a.s.l) is less than 4%, and it reaches 77% above 6000 m a.s.l. The intra-annual snow cover variation below 4000 m a.s.l features a unimodal distribution, while above 4000 m a.s.l it presents a bimodal distribution. The mean minimum SCF below 6000 m a.s.l occurs in summer, while above 6000 m a.s.l it occurs in winter. Due to differences in solar radiation and moisture condition caused by the mountain slope and aspect, the mean SCF generally increases with mountain slopes, and it is the highest on the north-facing aspect and the lowest on the south-facing aspect.","[Chu, Duo] Tibet Meteorol Bur, Tibet Inst Plateau Atmospher & Environm Sci, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [Chu, Duo] Sci & Technol Dept Tibet Autonomous Reg, Tibet Key Lab Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Res, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China; [Liu, Linshan; Wang, Zhaofeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Chu, D (corresponding author), Tibet Meteorol Bur, Tibet Inst Plateau Atmospher & Environm Sci, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China.;Chu, D (corresponding author), Sci & Technol Dept Tibet Autonomous Reg, Tibet Key Lab Plateau Atmosphere & Environm Res, Lhasa 850000, Peoples R China.",chu_d22@hotmail.com; liuls@igsnrr.ac.cn; wangzf@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2023,15.0,16,,,,,,,4044,10.3390/rs15164044,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15164044,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001056028600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Regionally representative emissions were used in chemical transport model simulations at a spatial resolution of 60 x 60 km(2), in April, July and September, chosen as months of contrasting emissions and rainfall. Modeled aerosol abundance in northern South Asia was predominantly found to be dust and carbonaceous in April, dust and sulfate in July and sulfate and carbonaceous in September. Anthropogenic aerosols arose from energy-use emissions (from industrial sources, residential biofuel cooking, brick kilns) in all months, additionally from field burning in April, and incursion from East Asia in September. In April, carbonaceous aerosols were abundant from open burning of agricultural fields even at high altitude locations (Godavari), and of forests in the eastern Gangetic Plain (Kolkata). Direct radiative forcing and heating rate, calculated from OPAC-SBDART, using modeled aerosol fields, and corrected by MODIS AOD observations, showed regionally uniform atmospheric forcing in April, compared to that in other months, influenced by both dust and black carbon abundance. A strong spatial heterogeneity of radiative forcing and heating rate was found, with factor of 2.5-3.5 lower atmospheric forcing over the Tibet plateau than that over the Ganga Plain and Northwest in July and September. However, even over the remote Tibet plateau, there was significant anthropogenic contribution to atmospheric forcing and heating rate (45% in Apr, 75% in Sep). Wind fields showed black carbon transport from south Asia in April and east Asia in September. Further evaluation of the transport of dust and anthropogenic emissions from various source regions and their deposition in the Himalaya and Tibet, is important in understanding regional air quality and climate change over this ecosystem.

Conventional techniques generally focus on per-pixel based processing and overlook the sub-pixel variations occurring especially in case of low or moderate resolution remotely sensed data. However, the existing subpixel-based change detection (SCD) models are less effective to detect the mixed pixel information at its complexity level especially over rugged terrain regions. To overcome such issues, a topographically controlled SCD model has been proposed which is an improved version of widely used per-pixel based change vector analysis (CVA) and hence, named as a subpixel-based change vector analysis (SCVA). This study has been conducted over a part of the Western Himalayas using the advanced wide-field sensor (AWiFS) and Landsat-8 datasets. To check the effectiveness of the proposed SCVA, the cross-validation of the results has been done with the existing neural network-based SCD (NN-SCD) and per-pixel based models such as fuzzy-based CVA (FCVA) and post-classification comparison (PCC). The results have shown that SCVA offered robust performance (85.6%-86.4%) as compared to NN-SCD (81.6%-82.4%), PCC (79.2%-80.4%), and FCVA (81.2%-83.6%). We concluded that SCVA helps in reducing the detection of spurious pixels and improve the efficacy of generating change maps.

Glaciers are an important freshwater resource in the northern part of the Kunlun Mountains, and the melting of glaciers and snow provides an assured source of water for rivers on the southern edge of the Tarim Basin. Based on the first glacier inventory dataset on China (1968), the second glacier inventory dataset on China (2009), and the glacier inventory dataset on Western China in 2018, this study used DEM data, Landsat remote sensing images, and ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis data to investigate glacier change and its influencing factors with respect to the northern part of the Kunlun Mountains. The results showed that there were 9273 glaciers in the northern part of the Kunlun Mountains in 2018, with an area of about 11,762.72 km(2), an ice inventory of about 1168.53 km(3), and an average length per glacier of about 1.68 km. The glaciers were mainly distributed at altitudes of 5300-6100 m (7574.66 km(2)). From 1968 to 2018, the number of glaciers in the northern stretch of the Kunlun Mountains increased by 343, while the glacier area decreased by 2452.80 km(2) (-0.14%/a). From 2009 to 2018, the glacier area at the altitude of 4900 m to 6100 m decreased in the northern section of the Kunlun Mountains, and the glacier area at the remaining altitude increased slightly (10.67 km(2)). From 1968 to 2018, the glacier area and glacier length in all river basins decreased. The relative rate of glacier area change in the Qarqan River basin from 2009 to 2018 was five times that of 1968-2009, and this needs significant attention. From 1968 to 2018, both temperature and precipitation increased to varying degrees, and the increase in precipitation was beneficial to the accumulation of glaciers. Therefore, the increase in temperature was the main cause of glacier change in the northern section of the Kunlun Mountains.","[Niu, Shuting; Sun, Meiping; Wang, Guoyu; Wang, Weisheng; Yao, Xiaojun; Zhang, Cong] Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Sun, Meiping] Key Lab Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev Oasis, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guoyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Key Lab Remote Sensing Gansu Prov, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guoyu] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Heihe Remote Sensing Expt Res Stn, Lanzhou 734000, Peoples R China",,"Sun, MP (corresponding author), Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.;Sun, MP (corresponding author), Key Lab Resource Environm & Sustainable Dev Oasis, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.",2021212830@nwnu.edu.cn; sunmeiping1982@nwnu.edu.cn; 2020222779@nwnu.edu.cn; 2021212827@nwnu.edu.cn; xj_yao@nwnu.edu.cn; 2021120206@nwnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2023,15.0,16,,,,,,,3986,10.3390/rs15163986,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15163986,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001056748700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Qomolangma (Everest) National Nature Preserve (QNNP) is among the highest natural reserves in the world. Monitoring the spatiotemporal changes in the vegetation in this complex vertical ecosystem can provide references for decision makers to formulate and adapt strategies. Vegetation growth in the reserve and the factors driving it remains unclear, especially in the last decade. This study uses the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in a linear regression model and the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) algorithm to detect the spatiotemporal patterns of the variations in vegetation in the reserve since 2000. To identify the factors driving the variations in the NDVI, the partial correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression were used to quantify the impact of climatic factors, and the effects of time lag and time accumulation were also considered. We then calculated the NDVI variations in different zones of the reserve to examine the impact of conservation on the vegetation. The results show that in the past 19 years, the NDVI in the QNNP has exhibited a greening trend (slope = 0.0008/yr, p < 0.05), where the points reflecting the transition from browning to greening (17.61%) had a much higher ratio than those reflecting the transition from greening to browning (1.72%). Shift points were detected in 2010, following which the NDVI tendencies of all the vegetation types and the entire preserve increased. Considering the effects of time lag and time accumulation, climatic factors can explain 44.04% of the variation in vegetation. No climatic variable recorded a change around 2010. Considering the human impact, we found that vegetation in the core zone and the buffer zone had generally grown better than the vegetation in the test zone in terms of the tendency of growth, the rate of change, and the proportions of different types of variations and shifts. A policy-induced reduction in livestock after 2010 might explain the changes in vegetation in the QNNP.","[Zhang, Binghua; Zhang, Yili; Wang, Zhaofeng; Liu, Linshan; Liu, Qionghuan; Paudel, Basanta; Zhang, Huamin] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Binghua; Zhang, Yili; Wang, Zhaofeng; Liu, Linshan; Paudel, Basanta] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Ding, Mingjun; Zhang, Huamin] Jiangxi Normal Univ, Key Lab Poyang Lake Wetland & Watershed Res, Minist Educ, Sch Geog & Environm, Nanchang 330028, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Li, Lanhui] Xiamen Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Xiamen 361024, Peoples R China; [Li, Shicheng] China Univ Geosci, Sch Publ Adm, Dept Land Resource Management, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qionghuan] Shenzhen Univ, Res Inst Smart Cities, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China",,"Liu, LS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Liu, LS (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",zhangbh.17b@igsnrr.ac.cn; zhangyl@igsnrr.ac.cn; wangzf@igsnrr.ac.cn; dingmj@jxnu.edu.cn; liuls@igsnrr.ac.cn; lilh@xmut.edu.cn; lisc@cug.edu.cn; liuqh.16b@igsnrr.ac.cn; paudelb@igsnrr.ac.cn; zhanghuamin1995@jxnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2021,13.0,22,,,,,,,4725,10.3390/rs13224725,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13224725,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000726648300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Four CKGs and one CRF, transformed from existing traditional land use systems, were investigated in three socio-ecologically diverse landscapes of Nyishi, Adi and Monpa communities. Study participants, including both men and women, played an active role in devising locally compatible criteria and protocols for strengthening the conservation of key plant species within their traditional land use systems, through CKG and CRF approaches. A total of 86 plant species, conserved through the CKGs and 44 from the Adi CRF, were identified as having high food, ethnomedicinal and cultural values. The Shannon-Weaver index of richness of plant species conserved was highest in the Nyishi CKG, with a value of 38; while for Adi and Monpa it was 30 and 18, respectively. The pattern of Shannon-Weaver diversity index was in the order of 2.91, 2.64 and 2.63, respectively for the CKGs of these three communities. In comparison to individual CKGs, relatively higher species diversity (3.18) was found in the Adi CRF. Increased sharing of traditional knowledge among the community members, regular incomes and equitable sharing of the tangible and intangible benefits of using plant species were identified as important success indicators of the CKGs and CRF.

It exerts a significant impact on atmospheric stability absorption and emission of radiation, thus engendering alterations in the Earth's radiative equilibrium. As such, precise quantification of PWV holds the potential to enhance weather prognostication and fortify preparedness against severe meteorological phenomena. This study aimed to elucidate the spatial and temporal changes in seasonal and annual PWV across the Indus River Basin and its sub-basins using ERA5 reanalysis datasets. The present study used ERA5 PWV (entire atmospheric column), air temperature at 2 m (t2m) and 500 hPa (T_500hPa), evapotranspiration, and total cloud cover data from 1960 to 2021. Theil Sen slope estimator and Mann-Kendall test were used for trend analysis. Correlation and multiple regression methods were used to understand the association of PWV with other factors. The findings have unveiled the highest increase in mean PWV during the monsoon (0.40 mm/decade), followed by pre-monsoon (0.37 mm/decade), post-monsoon (0.27 mm/decade), and winter (0.19 mm/decade) throughout the study period. Additionally, the mean PWV exhibited the most pronounced positive trend in the sub-basin Lower Indus (LI), followed by Panjnad (P), Kabul (K), and Upper Indus (UI) across all seasons, except winter. Annual PWV has also risen in the Indus basin and its sub-basins over the last six decades. PWV exhibits a consistent upward trend up to an elevation of 3500 m within the basin which is most pronounced during the monsoon season, followed by the pre-monsoon. The escalating PWV within the basin is reasonably ascribed to increasing air temperatures, augmented evapotranspiration, and heightened cloud cover. These findings hold potential utility for pertinent authorities engaged in water resource management and planning.","[Rani, Seema; Singh, Jyotsna; Singh, Subhash; Tiwari, Purushottam] Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Geog, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mal, Suraj] Univ Delhi, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Coll, Dept Geog, New Delhi 110017, India; [Mal, Suraj] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Study Reg Dev, Delhi 110067, India",,"Rani, S (corresponding author), Banaras Hindu Univ, Inst Sci, Dept Geog, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",seemarani@bhu.ac.in; jyotsana1604@bhu.ac.in; subhashsingh@bhu.ac.in; purushottam@bhu.ac.in; suraj.mal@sbs.du.ac.in,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2023,20.0,10,,,,,2928,2945,,10.1007/s11629-023-8112-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-023-8112-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001101927300010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Periods of high major ion concentration in the aerosol generally coincide with similar periods in precipitation chemistry, although a linear relationship between concentrations in these 2 media is not robust due to limited data. High scavenging ratio values are found for all species except SO(4)(2-). Nitrate, Cl(-), and NH(4)(+) are enriched in the precipitation compared to the aerosol, implying the presence of gaseous acidic species (HNO(3) and HCl) and gaseous NH(3) in the air. Ammonium was also enriched with respect to SO(4)(2-) in aerosol during a dry episode in the monsoon season. This May represent relatively local sources of NH(3) (from neighboring villages) and was not scavenged due to the lack of precipitation. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis clearly shows the presence of 2 dominant pollutant transport mechanisms for the premonsoon and monsoon seasons (i.e., valley wind system and monsoon circulation). Although physically different, these 2 transport mechanisms follow similar transport pathways and transport aerosol into the Himalayas from similar source regions. Further, EOF analysis suggests a southerly maritime signal in the aerosol during monsoon and a more distant westerly maritime signal during premonsoon. Our results support the potential for using glaciochemical records from the Himalayas to investigate variations in the strength of past monsoon circulation and westerly disturbances.","Dept Hydrol & Meteorol, Kathmandu, Nepal; Univ New Hampshire, Inst Study Earth Oceans & Space, Climate Change Res Ctr, Durham, NH 03824 USA",,"Shrestha, AB (corresponding author), Dept Hydrol & Meteorol, POB 406,Babar Mahal, Kathmandu, Nepal.",abs@wlink.com.np,,,,,,,,64.0,75.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2002,36.0,4,,,,,441,456,,10.1080/027868202753571269,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/027868202753571269,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000174852800008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ISM dominantly controls the northern Indian Ocean sea-surface salinity, mostly in the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea, by the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Irrawaddy-Salween rivers outflow and direct rainfall. In the past decade, numerous studies have used radiogenic neodymium (epsilon(Nd)) isotopes of seawater to link Indian subcontinent erosion and the ensuing increase in discharge that results in changes in the north Indian Ocean sea surface. Here we synthesized the state of the ISM and ocean circulation using the neodymium and hafnium isotopes from north Indian Ocean deep-sea sediments. Our data suggest that the Bay of Bengal and north Indian Ocean sea-surface conditions were most likely modulated by changes in the ISM strength during the last glacial-interglacial cycle. These findings contrast to the hypothesis that suggests that the bottom water neodymium isotopes of the northern Indian Ocean were modulated by switching between two distant sources, namely North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic bottom water. Furthermore, the consistency between the neodymium and hafnium isotopes during the last glacial maximum and Holocene suggests a weak and dry ISM and strong and wet conditions, respectively. These data also indicate that the primary source of these isotopes was the Himalayas. Our results support the previously published paleo-proxy records, indicating weak and strong monsoons for the same periods. Moreover, our data further support the hypothesis that the northern Indian Ocean neodymium isotopes were decoupled from the global ocean neodymium budget due to the greater regional influence by the great Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Irrawaddy-Salween discharge draining the Indian subcontinent to the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea.","[Rashid, Harunur; Wang, Yang] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Rashid, Harunur] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Gourlan, Alexandra T.] Univ Savoie Mt Blanc, Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD,IFSTTAR,Inst Sci Terre, F-38400 Grenoble 09, France",,"Rashid, H (corresponding author), Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.;Rashid, H (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",harunurbhola@gmail.com; m180200479@st.shou.edu.cn; alexandra.gourlan@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2021,12.0,3,,,,,,,330,10.3390/atmos12030330,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12030330,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000633344100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accurate surface albedo determination is important for weather forecasting, climate projection and ecosystem modelling. Albedo-rainfall feedback relationship has not been studied so far using observations on spatial scale over Indian monsoon region due to lack of consistent, systematic and simultaneous long-term measurements of both. The present study used dekadal (ten-day) composite of satellite (e.g. NOAA) based Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) datasets between 1981 and 2000 over India (68-100A degrees E, 5-40A degrees N) at 8 km spatial resolution. Land surface albedo was computed using linear transformation of red and near infrared (NIR) surface reflectances. The cloud effects were removed using a smoothening filter with harmonic analysis applied to time series data in each year. The monthly, annual and long term means were computed from dekadal reconstructed albedo. The mean per year and coefficient of variation (CV) of surface albedo over seventeen years, averaged over Indian land region, were found to show a significantly decreasing (0.15 to 0.14 and 60 to 40%, respectively) trend between 1981 and 2000. Among all the land use patterns, the inter-annual variation of albedo of Himalayan snow cover showed a significant and the steepest reducing trend (0.42 - 0.35) followed by open shurbland, grassland and cropland. No significant change was noticed over different forest types.. This could be due to increase in snow melting period and snow melt area. A strong inverse exponential relation (correlation coefficient r = 0.95, n = 100) was found between annual rainfall and annual albedo over seven rainfall zones. The decreasing trend in snow-albedo of accumulation period (September to March) follows the declining trend in measured south-west monsoon rainfall between 1988 (980 mm) to 1998 (880 mm) over India. This finding perhaps suggests the possible reversal of reported coupling of increased snowfall followed by lower monsoon rainfall.","[Bhattacharya, Bimal Kumar; Gunjal, Keshav R.; Panigrahy, Sushma] Space Applicat Ctr ISRO, Agr Forestry & Environm Grp, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India; [Parihar, Jai Singh] Space Applicat Ctr ISRO, Remote Sensing Applicat Area RESA, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India",,"Bhattacharya, BK (corresponding author), Space Applicat Ctr ISRO, Agr Forestry & Environm Grp, Ahmadabad 380015, Gujarat, India.",bimal.vegetation@gmail.com,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2011,39.0,3,,,SI,,393,406,,10.1007/s12524-011-0136-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-011-0136-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000296518200013,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present study dominant land use types i.e. agroforestry (AF), banjoak forest (BF), chirpine forest (CF), mixed forest (MF) and grasslands (GL) of Himalayan region was investigated for biomass production and carbon stock budgeting in vegetation as well as in soil. Among land use type's highest aboveground biomass was recorded in banjoak forest (BF), 0.69%, 9.42% and 40.16% more than chirpine forest (CF), mixed forest (MF) and agroforestry (AF). However it was more than 16 times higher than grasslands (GL). Herbage and/or crops aboveground biomass was 3.73%, 4.05%, 4.42% and 29.34% of the aboveground biomass of trees in BF, CF, MF and AF. Herbage aboveground biomass was 76.01% of total aboveground biomass in grasslands. Our results revealed that in AF crops biomass accounted for 19.41 26.60% and trees contributed 73.40-80.59% biomass in total biomass of land use. Likewise, similar contributions were recorded for belowground biomass and total biomass in land uses. Irrespective of land use types along elevation the total biomass including aboveground and belowground biomass significantly (P < 0.01) increased. Among land use types and along the elevation similar trend was recorded for vegetation carbon stock as it is the manifestation of biomass. Soil carbon density differed significantly in land use types with highest in BF and increased significantly along the elevation with highest at elevation E-5. Forest land uses stored 26.22% and 53.79% more total (vegetation + soil) carbon in than agroforestry and grasslands. The difference in carbon storage among land use types can be related to land use type, vegetation composition, their structural and functional characteristics viz., density, age and soil type. Thus, tree based land use types are more efficient for biomass production and carbon storage in changing climatic pattern. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Yadav, R. P.; Bisht, J.

In the sub-Himalayan plains of India, nearly 6.05 x 10(4) km(2) area of most the fertile land occurs as interfluve of Late Quaternary age between the two major glacier-fed rivers (Ganga and Yamuna). The vast areal expanse of interfluve terminates at the rivers' confluence in Sangam (25 degrees 2513N-81 degrees 5322E), Allahabad. This is the first study of MS soil survey of the interfluve region at the confluence comprising 490 samples from 49 locations.

The lake is also attracting the attention of management authorities, being a growing tourist destination with sustainable environmental management plan. Lake Manasbal is only true warm monomictic urban lake in Kashmir and remains thermally stratified for 8-9 months, with separate layers of epilimnion, metalimnion and hypolimnion.We noticed that in the lower part of the hypolimnion, the process of stratification is characterized by an oxygen deficit (O-2 < 1 mg/L). The rate of oxygen depletion reported in the lake's bottom layers is indicative of the water body's more eutrophic nature. A clinograde type of pH curve with a wide range of fluctuation from top to bottom layers of water was observed. Thermal stratification of the lake allows ammonium and phosphates to pool in the hypolimnion for much of the stratification period, resulting in concentrations higher than in the epilimnion. Consequently, the lake was characterized by a nutrient-enriched hypolimnion and an epilimnion deprived of nutrients. With the advent of the lake stratification, the thermocline was formed on 15th March between 2 and 3 m and on 7th April between 4 and 6 m, which gradually moved down to 10 m on 4th July and remained at that depth until circulation. The concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen in Lake Manasbal showed an increase towards the bottom, thus revealing an inverse clinograde depth distribution. Due to stratification phenomena in this lake, the internal release and subsequent distribution of nutrients throughout water column especially phosphorus from sediment water interface after mixing is a cause of concern for management authorities as it has the potential to diminish the ecological and aesthetics of the lake.Therefore, we argue that this study will provide some valuable insights on how stratification is affecting the nutrient dynamics and will offer inputs for better management accordingly both from ecological and economic perspectives.","[Yaseen, Tabasum; Bhat, Sami Ullah] Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Srinagar 190006, J&K, India",,"Bhat, SU (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Srinagar 190006, J&K, India.",samiullahbhat11@gmail.com,,,,,,,,7.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 4,2021,232.0,3,,,,,,,111,10.1007/s11270-021-05054-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05054-x,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000626598600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, we aim to determine the potential factors that influence changes in thickness of debris-covered glaciers. First, we present the thickness changes of a large debris-covered glacier in the Tienshan Mountain using high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data from three periods in 2000, 2009 and 2013. It is shown that the thickness changes differ greatly over the debris-covered portions of the glacier. These debris-covered regions can be divided into three parts along the glacier axis according to the rate of thickness change. Specifically, these parts include the zone of minimal change, the zone of heavy thinning, and the zone of slight thinning. Detailed information on the closely related factors, including the debris thickness, which was measured across the whole glacier during our field work, and the presence of ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes detected on high-resolution satellite images, are combined to determine the reasons for the differences in melting state among the three zones. The results show that the thickness changes of the debris-covered glacier are jointly influenced by debris thickness and the presence of ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes; moreover, the dominant factor differs among the different zones. The critical debris thickness, which mostly appears in the minimal change zone and accelerates glacier melting, as confirmed through field observations, is not associated with glacier thinning because its location is close to the accumulation zone. The regions where the rates of thinning are greatest coincide with the regions where the ice cliffs are densest. Where the debris is thicker than 1 m on average, the glacier is still thinning slightly due to the presence of ice cliffs and lakes. It is proven that the quantity and area of the ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes is the key to understanding the melting rate of debris covered glacier.","[Huang, Lei; Li, Zhen; Tian, Bangsen; Zhou, Jianmin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Han, Haidong] State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China",,"Li, Z (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zli@irsa.ac.cn,,,,,,,,20.0,23.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 1,2018,206.0,,,,,,63,71,,10.1016/j.rse.2017.12.028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2017.12.028,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000427342700005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Rivers and wetlands are vital environmental elements linked to natural and human ecosystems, so it is extremely important to study ecohydrological planning and human well-being. This study investigates the impact of the dam on the hydrological abundance and eco-hydrological alterations of Loktak Lake, which is located upstream of the Ithai barrage. For this purpose, the Indicator of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) was used to examine the ecohydrological threshold, failure rate, impact magnitude and ecohydrological deficit/surplus in a river section and the adjacent wetland in three temporal phases (I, 1996-2001; II, 2006-2011; and III, 2016-2021). The results show that the hydrological surplus has recently increased to 27.22% (phase III), while in phase I it was only 1.1%. Due to the decreasing failure rate of ecological optima, eco-hydrological surplus was recorded in both Loktak lakes, which is an obvious indication of a reduction in ecological distress that may lead to negative impacts on natural and human well-being. However, due to the constant high-water level in the lake, Phumdi is no longer able to reach the bottom of the lake during the dry season. Since it cannot absorb nutrients, the lake's vegetation declines and rotting sediments settle. Since the Ithai Dam closed the outlet that once connected the lake to the sea, fishermen can no longer dispose of the decomposing biomass.

Four different biosphere regions, each over 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees area, have been selected considering the geospatial and climatic variability of these regions expanding from Central India (CI), the Northeast region (NER), the Western Ghats (WG), and the Western Himalayan region (WHNI). The climatic conditions of these four regions are different so are the biosphere constituents of these regions. We expect the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) to enhance during the all India summer monsoon rainfall season but in varied magnitudes suggesting a role of climatic parameters and flora in these regions. The GPP from FLUXCOM for the duration of 2001 to 2019 (19 years) and satellite-derived vegetation indices like the Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) are used in this study to understand the response of regional vegetation to this variability. EVI seems to be better related to GPP in comparison to NDVI in the preliminary analysis. Further analysis suggests LAI correlates better to GPP than EVI and NDVI in different seasons in these four regions. Also, meteorological parameters like surface temperature, rainfall, soil water, and other derived parameters like Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) are studied. It is also observed that the year-to-year variability in the climatic conditions could also have a role to play in the observed features. It is proven that the climate around the world is experiencing changes. Vegetation is one of the potent markers to monitor the impact of climate change. These long-term data and trends were studied to understand if there is any significant impact of the changing climatic conditions on the vegetation in these regions. Our study shows that there is an increasing (positive) trend in GPP at these locations though at different rates.

Different geophysical data, official data, and open street data were used to assess the land suitability for future urban growth by integrating multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques and different geo-statistical models, namely multi-influence factor, frequency ratio, weights of evidence, and evidential believe function. Based on the land suitability assessment (LSA) outcomes, four different zones were identified such as zone of very high suitability zone, high suitability zone, moderately suitable zone, and low suitable zone. The findings of this study revealed that the 1/3rd of the area in SMC, especially in the central-western part has observed as low suitability for sustainable urban development, whereas moderately suitable areas (32-36%) are composed of well-connected regions and 13-24% area has been noticed as the high to very high suitable zone for sustainable urban development. The outcome of the selected models has been validated (> 80%) by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve after checking multi-collinearity and variance inflation factors (VIF). Still, the northernmost and eastern parts of the SMC region have a high proportionality of new residential and built-up area sites that can be utilised as second-degree suitable land for future sustainable urban development.

The WQI values for four sampling sites were calculated and indicated that the water at Site I was the most contaminated followed by Site IV, while Site III was the least contaminated. Thus, highlighting that the pressure of anthropogenic activities is subjecting Dal Lake to an unnatural death.","[Ahmad, Tawseef; Gupta, Gaganjot; Sharma, Anshula; Kaur, Baljinder] Punjabi Univ Patiala, Dept Biotechnol, Patiala 147002, Punjab, India; [Alsahli, Abdulaziz Abdullah; Ahmad, Parvaiz] King Saud Univ, Bot & Microbiol Dept, Fac Sci, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Ahmad, Parvaiz] Sri Pratap Coll, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190001, Jammu & Kashmir, India",,"Kaur, B (corresponding author), Punjabi Univ Patiala, Dept Biotechnol, Patiala 147002, Punjab, India.;Ahmad, P (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Bot & Microbiol Dept, Fac Sci, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.;Ahmad, P (corresponding author), Sri Pratap Coll, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190001, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",tawseef.672@gmail.com; gaganbt01@gmail.com; anshula2sharma@gmail.com; baljinderkaur@pbi.ac.in; aalshenaifi@ksu.edu.sa; parvaizbot@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,13.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2020,12.0,9,,,,,,,2365,10.3390/w12092365,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12092365,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000580247000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study focused on assessment of combined hydrological response of LULC change and climatic variability in the upper catchment of Wular Lake. Multi-temporal satellite data were used for assessment of temporal dynamics of the lake catchment. The spatio-temporal pattern of annual soil loss and sediment yield has been assessed using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation approach and sediment delivery ratio adopted from USDA Soil Conservation Service in GIS environment. The runoff was estimated in the watershed using SCS curve number. The main impelling forces that led to the changes in land use/land cover in the catchment is mainly due to increased human activities, which ultimately leads to the increased erosion and sediment yield. The anticipated mean annual soil loss which was found 123.23 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the year 1992 increased to 942.52 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the year 2013. Similarly, estimated mean annual sediment yield also indicated an increase from 34.7 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the year 1992 to 233.4 t ha(-1) year(-1) in the year 2013. In addition, the decrease in rainfall from the last 35 years has led to the decline in runoff and consequent reduction in the surface water supply. The results of the present study indicate due to the changes in LULC and consequent hydrological changes like decreased run-off, increased erosion and sedimentation reduce the water holding capacity of lake day by day, thus leading to its deterioration.","[Mushtaq, Fayma; Lala, Mili Ghosh Nee] Birla Inst Technol Mesra, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi 835215, Bihar, India",,"Mushtaq, F (corresponding author), Birla Inst Technol Mesra, Dept Remote Sensing, Ranchi 835215, Bihar, India.",fayma1987@gmail.com; mili@bitmesra.ac.in,,,,,,,,13.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2017,76.0,22,,,,,,,760,10.1007/s12665-017-7065-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-017-7065-z,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000416820300029,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Rana, P; Varshney, LR",,,,"Rana, Pushpendra; Varshney, Lav R.",,,Exploring limits to tree planting as a natural climate solution,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Large-scale tree planting has been advocated for decades in many countries as a cost-effective strategy to mitigate carbon, rejuvenate degraded landscapes, and support local livelihoods. Recent studies, however, suggest limited ecological and livelihood impacts of tree planting programs, indicating possible limits to tree planting as a natural climate solution. In this paper, we explore these carrying capacity-like limits by evaluating the site suitability of forestry landscapes of the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh using theory/expert-based rules and machine learning algorithms. We find that the state can only achieve a maximum of 31.54% forest cover due to socio-ecological and biophysical constraints, much less than India's goal of bringing 66% of the total geographical area of Himalayan states into forest cover. The low availability of suitable lands for growing trees, together with poor plantation site selection by forest range officers limit the use of tree planting as a sole climate mitigation strategy. To approach theoretical planting limits, we propose an ePSA (e-Plantation Site Assistant) recommendation system based on our site-suitability results to assist forest rangers in selecting suitable sites for planting trees. An initial deployment of the recommender system suggests its potential utility in shaping the longterm success of tree plantations as an effective carbon strategy in northern India and beyond. Overall, we argue that there is a need to realign over-ambitious national and international tree planting targets with actual limits from site characteristics to avoid massive wastage of funds and to obtain feasible carbon mitigation outcomes.","[Rana, Pushpendra] Indian Forest Serv, New Delhi, India; [Varshney, Lav R.] Univ Illinois, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Champaign, IL USA; [Rana, Pushpendra] Indian Forest Serv, Shimla 171001, Himachal Prades, India",,"Rana, P (corresponding author), Indian Forest Serv, Shimla 171001, Himachal Prades, India.",hp131@ifs.nic.in; varshney@illinois.edu,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 15,2023,384.0,,,,,,,,135566,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135566,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135566,,DEC 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000904914000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To assess forest health, we exained multiple forest indicators including di-versity, age structure, regeneration, and edaphic factors of the dominant and associated tree species in their natural forest habitats. A stratified random cluster sampling strategy was used to gather vegetation samples from the five main forest types in the Zabarwan Mountain Range-Acacia forest (ACFT), Broad leaved forest (BLFT), Oak forest (OKFT), Pinus wallichiana forest (PWFT), and Scrub forest (SRFT). The Pearson method and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to investigate the relationship between tree species and edaphic fac-tors. A total of 22 tree species were found, of which 13 were exotic and 9 were native. The proportion of exotic species was highest in OKFT (85%), followed by BLFT (75%), and the least (50%) SRFT. The BLFT forest type had the highest Shannon diversity while the lowest was the SRFT. ACFT and BLFT forest types have significantly higher Shannon diversity indexes than other forest types. Based on the density-girth class distribution, ACFT & SRFT forest types showed an Inverse-J distribution pattern, indicating a stable population structure. The dominant tree species, such as Populus alba in BLFT, demonstrated comparatively no regeneration, whereas Parrotiopsis jacquemontiana in SRFT, Pinus wallichiana in PWFT, Quercus robur in OKFT, and Robinia pseudoacacia demonstrated adequate regeneration performance. Overall exotic tree species such as Robinia pseudoacacia, Prunus cerasifera, Celtis australis, and Ailanthus altissima showed high/sufficient regeneration performance. The average seedling/tree value for all forest types in the area was 2.14, with the highest value at BLFT (3.61) and the lowest value at SRFT (0.71). In the CCA it showed that SRFT forests were greatly influenced by salinity and organic carbon, whereas ACFT and OKFT forests had comparable habitat preferences and were mutually influ-enced by electrical conductance and phosphorus availability. Prunus cerasifera was the only species positively associated with available calcium. By combining the data of numerous field-based indicators into a single in-tegrated study, our research will give decision-makers an update on a forest's current and anticipated health.","[Haq, Shiekh Marifatul; Bussmann, Rainer W.] Ilia State Univ, Inst Bot, Dept Ethnobot, Tbilisi, Georgia; [Waheed, Muhammad] Univ Okara, Dept Bot, Okara 56300, Pakistan; [Khoja, Aadil Abdullah] Glocal Univ Saharanpur, Dept Bot, Saharanpur 247121, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Amjad, Muhammad Shoaib] Women Univ Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Dept Bot, Bagh 12500, Pakistan; [Amjad, Muhammad Shoaib] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Inst Forest Res, Birmingham B15 2TT, England; [Bussmann, Rainer W.] Inst Life Sci, State Museum Nat Hist, Dept Bot, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Ali, Kishwar] Univ Doha Sci & Technol, Coll Gen Educ, Jelaiah St,POB 24449, Doha, Qatar; [Jones, David Aaron] Univ Doha Sci & Technol, Coll Hlth Sci, Jelaiah St,POB 24449, Doha, Qatar",,"Amjad, MS (corresponding author), Women Univ Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Dept Bot, Bagh 12500, Pakistan.;Amjad, MS (corresponding author), Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Inst Forest Res, Birmingham B15 2TT, England.;Jones, DA (corresponding author), Univ Doha Sci & Technol, Coll Hlth Sci, Jelaiah St,POB 24449, Doha, Qatar.",malikshoaib1165@yahoo.com; davidaaron.jones@udst.edu.qa,,,,,,,,8.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2023,150.0,,,,,,,,110225,10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110225,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110225,,APR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000983878000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A number of initiatives were taken for grafting this species to obtain better seeds for oil production, without the basic information on their ecology and management. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the composition, structure and regeneration dynamics of Olea ferruginea forests in Malakand Division, Hindukush range of Pakistan. In the present study, five communities dominated by Olea ferruginea were identified using Ward's agglomerative cluster analysis. Total tree density ranged from 153-2602 plants/ha, and basal area from 19.55 to 2353 m(2) ha(-1) with Olea having a relative density of 51% to 87% and basal area of 48% to 93%, respectively. The density of juveniles of the dominant and subordinate tree species were generally low which reflect their narrow distribution in the study area. Size-class distributions of O. ferruginea disclosed a bell-shaped pattern, indicating that forests were heavily exploited by local inhabitants in previous periods and recently by armed forces owing to security risks in the study area. The age (mean max. 300 +/- 34 years) and annual increment (3.2 +/- 1.2 years/cm) indicates that the species is long lived and generally slow growing among the different broad leaved species studied so far. However, the oldest trees can be found by the exploration of large diameter trees in the area. In addition, we found a stable linear relationship between the age and diameter (r (2) = 0.779), indicating that diameter is a good predictor of age for this broad leaved species. In view of its relatively slow growth, longevity and positive ring-width characteristics O. ferruginea seems to be a suitable choice for dendroecological and dendrochronological studies in lesser Himalayan and Hindukush ranges of Pakistan.

Evaluation of plants' functioning across habitats helps in understanding which traits are contributing to invasion success in response to changing environmental factors as well as the habitat preference and vulnerability of invasive plants. This study analyzed the effects of forest types on the growth and reproduction capacity of a dreadful invasive alien weed Ageratina adenophora (Spreng.) King and Rob. Different forest types selected for the present study were Sal, Sal-mixed, Chir-Pine, Banj-Oak, Cypress, and Kharsu-Oak forests in Kumaun Himalaya, India. At each forest site, twenty-four 1 x 1 m size quadrats were randomly laid during the peak growth period of A. adenophora (mid-March-April). The numbers of A. adenophora individuals/quadrats were also counted to compute the density of this weed in each forest type. Three plants were chosen at random from each quadrat and uprooted carefully followed by their morphological and reproductive traits assessment in each forest type following standard methods. To check the variability in soil physicochemical properties, the soil was collected from the surface layer (0-15 cm depth) of each forest type in replicates of three using soil corer. Other environmental variables like aspect, elevation, and solar irradiance were also recorded for selected forest types. ANOVA results showed a significant effect of forest types on all the measured plant traits except root length (p = 0.427), root/shoot ratio (p = 0.201), and root weight ratio (p = 0.225). Soil physicochemical properties also showed considerable variations across forest types except for soil pH. The maximum density (109 individuals/m(2)), plant height, (149.6 cm/plant), aboveground biomass (19.59 g/plant), and belowground biomass (2.82 g/plant) were recorded in the Cypress forest population, while the lowest growth was recorded in the Kharsu-Oak forest population with 10 individuals/m(2) density, 57.94 cm plant height, 3.36 g aboveground biomass, and 0.30 g belowground biomass/plant. Generally, A. adenophora allocated maximum biomass to shoots (57-81%), thus increasing carbon assimilation, while minimum biomass was allocated to reproductive parts (0-17%) indicating higher growth through vegetative propagation. Leaf area was highest in the Banj-Oak forest (2266.04 cm(2)), while reproductive performance in terms of seed numbers (13,646 seeds/plant), seed weight (0.54 g/plant), and reproductive index (119.26) was highest in the Sal-mixed forest. This study concluded that A. adenophora acclimates to heterogeneous environments in different forest ecosystems through higher plasticity in most of the observed traits. The maximum growth performance of A. adenophora recorded in open-canopied Cypress forest suggested some kind of shade treatment before the emergence of the invader as a control measure to check the invasion.","[Khatri, Kavita; Negi, Bhawna; Bargali, Kiran; Bargali, Surendra Singh] Kumaun Univ, Dept Bot, DSB Campus, Naini Tal 263002, Uttarakhand, India",,"Bargali, SS (corresponding author), Kumaun Univ, Dept Bot, DSB Campus, Naini Tal 263002, Uttarakhand, India.",kabitakhatri000@gmail.com; negibhawna20@gmail.com; kiranbargali@yahoo.co.in; surendrakiran@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,2023 JUL 3,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10668-023-03529-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-03529-x,,JUL 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001022794200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Furthermore, our data advances the understanding of Hg dynamics in remote, high mountain ecosystems and provides baseline data for biomonitoring for reduction of Hg emission globally.","[Hu, Huijian; Zhou, Zhixin; Singh, Paras Bikram; Hu, Yiming] Guangdong Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Guangdong Key Lab Anim Conservat & Resource Utili, Guangdong Publ Lab Wild Anim Conservat & Utilizat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yanju] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518005, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ma, Yanju; Chen, Lianghua] Southeast Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210088, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shang, Lihai; Zhang, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, Guiyang 550081, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China",,"Hu, YM (corresponding author), Guangdong Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Guangdong Key Lab Anim Conservat & Resource Utili, Guangdong Publ Lab Wild Anim Conservat & Utilizat, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.",yiming1226@126.com,,,,,,,,4.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 1,2021,288.0,,,,,,,,117752,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117752,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117752,,JUL 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000697022600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The inter-annual glacier ice thickness observations (more than 5 years) exploit the glacier mass changes. Ice thickness is one of the important parameters to predict the future sea-level rise. Without adequate knowledge and precise information of glacier ice thickness distribution, future sea-level changes cannot be accurately assessed. In this study, we use an existing flow model to estimate the ice thickness of the High Mountain Asia (HMA) glaciers, using remote sensing techniques. The glacier ice velocity is one of the significant parameters in the Laminar flow model to retrieve the ice thickness. The glacier ice velocity is derived by utilizing the Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) technique. The most optimum DInSAR data (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2) is used for estimating the ice velocity of the HMA glaciers. The ice thickness is mainly estimated for five different states in the HMA region, namely Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, Bhutan, and Arunachal Pradesh. Most of the states are observed with a mean ice thickness of 100 m. Five benchmark glaciers (Samudra Tapu, Bara Shigri, Chhota Shigri, Sakchum, and Gangotri glaciers) are also selected for validating our results with the existing thickness information. The issues related to velocity-based ice thickness inversion are also emphasized in this study. The high-velocity rate due to the influx of melting water from adjacent glaciers causes an increment in the flow rate. This abnormal velocity derives erroneous ice thickness measurements. This is one of the major problems to be considered in the velocity-based thickness-derived procedures. Finally, the investigation suggests the inclusion of the velocity influencing parameters in the physical-based models for an accurate ice thickness inversion.","[Nela, Bala Raju; Singh, Gulab] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Kulkarni, Anil, V] Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bengaluru 560012, Karnataka, India",,"Singh, G (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",gulab.singh@iitb.ac.in,,,,,,,,9.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2023,195.0,1,,,,,,,15,10.1007/s10661-022-10658-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10658-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000871077800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet little is known about its pres-ence in, and implications for, freshwater ecosystems or its downstream contribution to plastic pollution in the ocean. This study documents fishing gear-related debris in one of the world's largest plastic pollution contribut-ing river catchments, the Ganges. Riverbank surveys conducted along the length of the river, from the coast in Bangladesh to the Himalaya in India, show that derelict fishing gear density increases with proximity to the sea. Fishing nets were the main gear type by volume and all samples examined for polymer type were plastic. Il-legal gear types and restricted net mesh sizes were also recorded. Socio-economic surveys of fisher communities explored the behavioural drivers of plastic waste input from one of the world's largest inland fisheries and revealed short gear lifespans and high turnover rates, lack of appropriate end-of-life gear disposal methods and ineffective fisheries regulations. A biodiversity threat assessment identified the air-breathing aquatic vertebrate species most at risk of entanglement in, and impacts from, derelict fishing gear; namely species of threatened freshwater turtle and otter, and the endangered Ganges river dolphin. This research demonstrates a need for targeted and practical interventions to limit the input of fisheries-related plastic pollution to this major river system and ultimately, the global ocean. The approach used in this study could be replicated to examine the inputs, solo-economic drivers and ecological impacts of this previously uncharacterised but important source of plastic pollution in other major rivers worldwide.

Himalayan physiographic unit of India in due course has become populated and is tolerating all kinds of human interventions. Soil erosion in this region has been identified as a major problem due to both natural and anthropogenic factors. Remote sensing and Geographical Information system (GIS) techniques hold great promises in the assessment and conservation of natural resources including the surface soil. The major objective of the present study was to apply a process based model to quantify soil erosion and to prioritize the sub-watershed on this basis. The sub-watershed located at Jakhan rao area of Western Dun in lower Himalayan belt was taken as the test site for the study at 1 : 50,000 scale. Deforestation, unscientific agricultural practices, terrace farming, cattle grazing and land degradation in the sub-watershed are some of the anthropogenic factors causing soil erosion in the area. Here, MMF model was used for estimation of soil erosion by incorporating layers derived from both remote sensing and ancillary data. IRS 1C LISS III satellite data was used for the preparation of land use map that was used to derive RD map, BD map and K map. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) provided slope map, an intermediate layer used in equation 6 to generate G map, and soil map provided MS map, BD map and K map. The above intermediate layers generated were then integrated in GIS domain to estimate the amount of soil erosion in the sub-watershed area. Results show high values 4572.333 kg/m(2) for G map, which depicted transport capacity of overland flow. Comparatively lower values 13.15, and 7.98 kg/m(2) were observed for F map, which depicted soil detachment by raindrop impact. The subtracted image of the aforesaid layers produced the real picture, where in the highest value 3.770 kg/m(2) was found in the midland region of the site. The crossed erosion map was then classified into different erosion classes for sub-watershed area. This study illustrates the applications of remote sensing and GIS techniques for soil erosion modeling.","[Behera, Pallavi] Indian Inst Remote Sensing NRSA, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Rao, K.

The purpose of this study is to develop the fully polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) deep neural networks classification approach for the extraction of different features of the alpine glaciers. The developed approach was tested and classification results were compared with the support vector machines-based classification over the part of two glaciers: Siachen glacier and Bara Shigri glacier. The overall accuracy (OA) of GF-DNN classification is relatively high (91.17% for Siachen and 89% for Bara Shigri) with a good kappa coefficient (0.88 for Siachen and 0.85 for Bara Shigri) as compared to SVM for both the selected glaciers. An improvement of more than 10% is achieved in the OA of GF-DNN classification as compared to SVM for both the glaciers.

Among these, air pollution has generated much interest, since it has a major influence on the transboundary dispersion of pollutants globally. Air pollution tolerance index (APTI) value represents tolerance level of plants which help in selecting the most suitable plant species for plantation in/around affected areas. This parameter in conjunction with Anticipated Performance Index (API) can provide a logical solution for green belt development by considering biological and socio-economic aspect of the species and help in reducing the levels of pollutants. The present study was conducted in Himachal Pradesh, constituting a very vital part of the Indian Himalayan Region. In the present study, APTI and API values of six commonly growing temperate and sub-temperate plant species viz., Quercus leucotrichophora, Rubus ellipticus, Debregeasia saeneb, Hypericum oblongifolium, Punica granatum, and Grevillea robusta, were evaluated along the National Highway-5 in Himachal Pradesh. The highest value of APTI was observed for Grevillea robusta (12.89), followed by Punica granatum (10.87), Debregeasia saeneb (10.50), Hypericum oblongifolium (10.43), Rubus ellipticus (10.18), and Quercus leucotrichophora (9.68). Upon assessment of API, it was observed that Grevillea robusta (62.50%) was the highest scoring plant species in trees, while Rubus ellipticus and Debregeasia saeneb were the highest scoring shrub species (56.25% each) and thus can be recommended for green belt development and attenuation of air pollution in the region.

Authentic standards of most SOA products were not commercially available at the time of this study, so surrogate standards were used for semiquantitation. Using an empirical approach to uncertainty estimation based on homologous series of atmospherically relevant model compounds, analytical uncertainties ranged from 32% for SOA tracers with structurally similar surrogates to more than 100% for tracers with a poorly matched surrogate. Biogenic SOA contributions to PM2.5 organic carbon content in the 2005 monsoon and post-monsoon season ranged from 2-19% for isoprene, 1-5% for monoterpenes and 1-4% for sesquiterpenes.

It is hypothesized that distribution pattern of J. dolomiaea and associated community structure is strongly influenced by environment prevalent variables. The present study revealed a total of 60 plant species belonging to 50 genera and 25 families recorded in association with J. dolomiaea with Asteraceae, Poaceae and Rosaceae as the dominant plant families. J. dolomiaea was recorded with highest average IVI value of 31.01 accompanied by Co-dominant taxa including Sibbaldia cunneata, Carex nubigena, Poa alpina and Poa pratensis. Jurinea dolomiaea exhibited a distinct distribution pattern in open sunny slopes confined to the south facing aspect receiving maximum solar insolation enabling the plant to survive in extremely cold alpine habitat. The average values of Simpsons and Shannons diversity for the recorded plant communities were 0.90 and 2.67 respectively, whereas Species evenness averaged as 0.68. Vegetation exhibited relatively higher (>50) value of maturity averaging as 62.57.

In this study, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Himalayan spruce needle samples from Zhangmu-Nyalam region (central-Himalayas) were analyzed and the altitudinal gradient of these pollutants was investigated. Total HCHs and DDTs concentration in needles were in the range of 1.3-2.9 ng g(-1) dry weight and 1.7-11 ng g(-1) dry weight, which were lower than concentrations reported in spruce needles from Alps, however higher than concentrations in conifer needles from mountain areas of Alberta. Total Himalayan spruce needle PAHs was below 600 ng g(-1) and fluorene, phenanthrene and acenaphthene were abundant individual compounds measured. The ratios of alpha-HCH/gamma-HCH in pine needles were similar with the usual values for technical HCH, implying technical HCHs might be used in this region. The high ratios of o-p'-DDT/p-p'-DDT and no p-p'-DDE measured in this study led to the suspicion that a new source of o-p'-DDT and/or p-p'-DDT existed in this region. In addition, higher ratios of low molecular weight-/high molecular weight-PAHs in this region indicated that petroleum combustion, vehicle emission and low-temperature combustion might be the major contributions of PAH source. To examine the POPs distillation, the analyte concentrations were correlated with altitude. The more volatile OCPs, alpha-HCH, gamma-HCH, aldrin and alpha-endosulfan positively correlated with altitude, however, less volatile OCPs (DDT and DDD) inversely related with elevation. Almost all PAHs detected in this area showed positive correlations with altitude. It is worthy to note that heavy PAHs (Benzo[k] fluoranthene and Benzo[a] anthracene) displayed positive correlation, which implied the sources of PAHs were near the sampling sites. The distillation of POPs was strongly affected by the proximity between sampling sites and contaminant sources. If the contaminant sources are close to the mountains, it may be the dominant factor that controls the concentration gradient.

The land use/cover change maps between 2001 and 2016 derived from remotely sensed imagery showed that the Pong Dam wetland is severely affected due to anthropogenic pressure posing risks of habitat destruction within its catchment area. The agriculture area increased by 159% and barren land decreased by 53% between 2001 and 2016. It indicates the rapid conversion of unused or scrub land for agriculture purpose in the area. The rate of sedimentation in the wetland is around 24.4M.cum/year, and the survival age of the wetland is about 100years. This rate is likely to increase in the near future due to large-scale unregulated development in the area. To reduce further destruction in this wetland, agricultural practices should be minimized in the area, and agroforestry practices should be encouraged to maintain the health and ecology of the wetland.","[Malik, Maansi; Rai, S.

We are now at the beginning of the international decade for biodiversity and by the time we travel through the decade, there would be sea-changes in the measurement and monitoring approaches, database management options, and inter-linked studies on biodiversity. With the onset of geoinformatics techniques comprising remote sensing, global positioning system (GPS), integrative tools, such as GIS, is realized as a complimentary system to ground-based biodiversity studies. Recently, a nationwide biodiversity study at landscape level using geoinformatics modeling techniques for India has been completed. The study has assessed plant diversity using a three-tier approach, wherein six biodiversity attributes (i.e., spatial, phytosociological, social, physical, economical, and ecological) were linked together based on their relative importance to stratify biological richness of forest vegetation (non-agricultural) of India. It has enumerated 7,964 plant species from 20,000 nested quadrate sampling plots of 0.04 ha each, delineated and mapped 120 vegetation classes; and organized the geo-spatial database on bisindia web portal. Here, we have (i) proposed a method to incorporate the fauna component in-line up with the existing methodology and (ii) utilized the GPS-gathered positional information on the distribution of two species (i.e., Medicago sativa and Poa annua to simulate their distribution for the year 2020 (SRES A1-B scenario, IPCC) using Maxent model. The study conducted in a test site of western Himalayas estimated (i) 24% increase in the overall biologically rich areas on supplement of fauna data and (ii) distribution of both the species would tend to increase in favor of shorter cold season. The study highlights the importance of geoinformatics technique-based biodiversity study for its amenability to incorporate any further change or modification, and utility of the geo-spatial biodiversity database for simulating various species distribution scenarios to understand their ecology in today's fast changing climate for effective conservation prescriptions.","[Matin, Shafique; Chitale, Vishwas Sudhir; Behera, Mukunda Dev; Mishra, Birupakshya; Roy, Partha Sarathi] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Oceans Rivers Atmosphere & Land Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India",,"Matin, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Oceans Rivers Atmosphere & Land Sci, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",shafiquematin@gmail.com,,,,,,,,14.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2012,21.0,5,,,SI,,1229,1250,,10.1007/s10531-012-0233-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-012-0233-2,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000302570400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Over the western part of the region, almost one-third of the annual precipitation is received in winter during cyclonic storms embedded in westerlies, known locally as the western disturbance. In the present paper, the regional winter climate over the western Himalayas is analyzed from simulations produced by two regional climate models (RCMs) forced with large-scale fields from ERA-Interim. The analysis was conducted by the composition of contrasting (wet and dry) winter precipitation years. The findings showed that RCMs could simulate the regional climate of the western Himalayas and represent the atmospheric circulation during extreme precipitation years in accordance with observations. The results suggest the important role of topography in moisture fluxes, transport and vertical flows. Dynamical downscaling with RCMs represented regional climates at the mountain or even event scale. However, uncertainties of precipitation scale and liquid-solid precipitation ratios within RCMs are still large for the purposes of hydrological and glaciological studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A model for metamorphic assemblage was developed to predict the nature and grade of metamorphism in order to address the problem with the inadequate quantification of mineral spectral mixing. The study addresses the problem by incorporating semi-empirical method of classification of metamorphic rock assemblage based on reflectance characteristics. We use the simulated spectral library of Hyperion satellite data which is favourable for classifying geological outcrops in metamorphic terrain of the Almora nappe of lower Himalayas. The Hyperion data analysis reveals the nature and trend of change of the metamorphic grades within different zones based on mass proportion of index mineral assemblages.

Delineating the patterns and processes shaping the evolution of urban regions is an essential part of this step. Utilizing remote-sensing techniques and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools, we performed an integrated analysis on urban expansion in Srinagar city and surrounding areas from 1999 to 2017 at multiple scales in order to assist urban planning initiatives. To capture various spatial indicators of expansion, we analysed (i) land use/land cover (LULC) changes, (ii) rate and intensity of changes to built-up areas, (iii) spatial differentiation in landscape metrics (at 500, 1000 and 2000 m cell-size), and (iv) growth type of the urban expansion. Global Moran's I statistics and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were also employed to identify hotspots of change in landscape structure. Our methodology utilizes a range of geovisualization tools which are capable of appropriately addressing various elements required for strategic planning in growing cities. The results highlight aggregation and homogenization of the urban core as well as irregularity and fragmentation in its periphery. A combination of spatial metrics and growth type analysis supports the supposition that there is a continuum in the diffusion-coalescence process. This allows us to extend our understanding of urban growth theory and to report deviations from accepted stages of growth. As our results show, each dominating growth phase of the city-both diffusion (1999) and coalescence (2009 and 2017)-is interspersed with features from the other type. An improved understanding of spatial differentiation and the identification of hotspots can serve to make urban planning more tailored to such local conditions. An important insight derived from the results is the applicability of remote-sensing data in urban planning measures and the usefulness of freely available medium resolution data in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of cities.","[Anees, Mangalasseril Mohammad; Sharma, Mani; Joshi, Pawan K.] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Spatial Anal & Informat Lab SAIL, New Delhi 110067, India; [Anees, Mangalasseril Mohammad; Banzhaf, Ellen] UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Mann, Deepika] Shiv Nadar Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Dadri 201314, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Mann, Deepika] Eberswalde Univ Sustainable Dev, Ctr Econ & Ecosyst Management, D-16225 Eberswalde, Germany; [Sharma, Mani] Govt Haryana, GIS Div, Gurugram Metropolitan Dev Author, Gurugram 122003, Haryana, India; [Joshi, Pawan K.] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Special Ctr Disaster Res, New Delhi 110067, India",,"Anees, MM (corresponding author), Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Spatial Anal & Informat Lab SAIL, New Delhi 110067, India.;Anees, MM (corresponding author), UFZ Helmholtz Ctr Environm Res, Dept Urban & Environm Sociol, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",anees.mangalasseril-mohammad@ufz.de; dm434@snu.edu.in; ellen.banzhaf@ufz.de; pkjoshi@mail.jnu.ac.in,,,,,,,,21.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2020,12.0,8,,,,,,,1306,10.3390/rs12081306,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12081306,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000534628800079,View Full Record in Web of Science

Darjeeling, located in the Eastern Himalayan Region of India, is such a city which faces acute water scarcity in most part of the year, except during monsoon. The city cannot use ground water directly, and there is no river as source of water as well. It only uses spring water and rain water. The climatic condition and local environmental conditions have higher control over the availability of daily water. This article analyses the city's 100-year climatic conditions as well as the condition of vegetation cover and built-up areas using NDVI and BUI methods, respectively. The present study explores that the deterioration of natural environmental conditions and increasing demand from both the permanent population and transitory population accelerate the intensity of water scarcity. Measuring the fluctuation of discharge (during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon period), the paper discusses how except in monsoon, most of the spring's discharge gets reduced and increases the level of water stress in the city. Using quantitative methods, this empirical study explores that the loss of vegetation and haphazard constructions have enormous impact on the fragile hill ecosystem and reduce the rate of infiltration of water in the sub-surface zones, thus reducing the discharge ultimately. Therefore, the study recommends immediate actions to protect the city environment and to revive those springs for the city's water security.","[Koner, Kaberi; Samanta, Gopa] Univ Burdwan, Dept Geog, Burdwan 713104, W Bengal, India",,"Koner, K (corresponding author), Univ Burdwan, Dept Geog, Burdwan 713104, W Bengal, India.",kaberikoner.geo@gmail.com; gopasamanta@gmail.com,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2021,23.0,12,,,,,17459,17482,,10.1007/s10668-021-01396-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01396-y,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000640476100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

With transport to the nearby Himalayas and deposition to its surfaces the particles contribute to glacier melt and snowmelt via darkening of the highly reflective snow. The central Himalayas have been identified as a region where LAPs are especially pronounced in glacier snow but still remain a region where measurements of LAPs in the snow are scarce. Here we study the deposition of LAPs in five snow pits sampled in 2016 (and one from 2015) within 1 km from each other from two glaciers in the Sunderdhunga Valley, in the state of Uttarakhand, India, in the central Himalayas. The snow pits display a distinct enriched LAP layer interleaved by younger snow above and older snow below. The LAPs exhibit a distinct vertical distribution in these different snow layers. For the analyzed elemental carbon (EC), the younger snow layers in the different pits show similarities, which can be characterized by a deposition constant of about 50 mu g m(-2) mm(-1) snow water equivalent (SWE), while the old-snow layers also indicate similar values, described by a deposition constant of roughly 150 mu g m(-2) mm(-1) SWE. The enriched LAP layer, contrarily, displays no similar trends between the pits. Instead, it is characterized by very high amounts of LAPs and differ in orders of magnitude for concentration between the pits. The enriched LAP layer is likely a result of strong melting that took place during the summers of 2015 and 2016, as well as possible lateral transport of LAPs. The mineral dust fractional absorption is slightly below 50% for the young- and old-snow layers, whereas it is the dominating light-absorbing constituent in the enriched LAP layer, thus, highlighting the importance of dust in the region. Our results indicate the problems with complex topography in the Himalayas but, nonetheless, can be useful in large-scale assessments of LAPs in Himalayan snow.","[Svensson, Jonas; Asmi, Eija; Hooda, Rakesh; Lihavainen, Heikki; Hyvarinen, Antti] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Atmospher Composit Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Svensson, Jonas; Jacobi, Hans-Werner] Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD, INP G,IGE, Grenoble, France; [Strom, Johan] Stockholm Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Honkanen, Henri; Lepparanta, Matti] Univ Helsinki, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res, Fac Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Dkhar, Nathaniel B.; Tayal, Shresth; Sharma, Ved P.] Energy & Resource Inst TERI, New Delhi, India; [Tayal, Shresth; Sharma, Ved P.] TERI Sch Adv Studies TERI SAS, New Delhi, India; [Lihavainen, Heikki] Svalbard Integrated Arctic Earth Observing Syst, Longyearbyen, Norway",,"Svensson, J (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, Atmospher Composit Res, Helsinki, Finland.;Svensson, J (corresponding author), Univ Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IRD, INP G,IGE, Grenoble, France.",jonas.svensson@fmi.fi,,,,,,,,6.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 26,2021,21.0,4,,,,,2931,2943,,10.5194/acp-21-2931-2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-2931-2021,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000635131000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A temperature index model WinSRM is used to calculate the discharge from simulated snowmelt runoff during 2010-2014. The variables of the model include precipitation, rainfall, air temperature, and snow cover area (SCA). Air temperature and precipitation are obtained from the MERRA-2 reanalysis and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded data, respectively, over the delineated zones of the basin. The SCA is estimated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow product: MOD10A2 data with an 8-day period or composite SCA of 500-m spatial resolution interpolated to a daily scale. Five-year simulation results show that the discharge maintains a high flow in monsoon with a mean value of 375.50 m(3)/s. However, the model underestimates the average runoff volume by 7% in 2013 and overestimates it by 10% in 2010. The observed snow volume difference (D-v%) is - 10.32 and + 4.36 for the years 2010 and 2012, respectively. Measured and simulated discharge rates are found to be in agreement with correlation coefficients in the range of 0.81-0.84 during the 2010-2014 period. Simulated discharge rates showed strong variability with typically highest values from mid-June to August (e.g. 3400.31 m(3)/s in 2013). The model also showed some additional peaks in September and June as seen in measurements during 2010, 2013, and 2014.

The study area falls under the international boundary region which generally covered by the snow (38%) on high altitude regions of the western part of Himalayas. Avalanches are triggered in study area during snowfall resulting in loss of human life, property and moreover the transportation and communication affected by the debris which ultimately delays the relief measures. Therefore in this study three major causative parameters i.e terrain, ground cover and meteorological have been incorporated for the identification of avalanche hazard zones (AHZ) by integrating Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method in Geographical Information System (GIS). In the first part of study, avalanche sites have been identified by the criteria related to terrain (slope, aspect and curvature) and ground cover. Weights and ratings to these causative factors and their cumulative effects have been assigned on the basis of experience and knowledge of field. In the second part of the study, single point interpolation and Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) method has been employed as only one weather station falls in study area. Accordingly, it has been performed to generate the meteorological parameter maps (viz. air temperature and relative humidity) from the field observatories and Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) located at Baaj OP in Uri sector. Finally, the meteorological parameter maps were superimposed on the terrain-based avalanche hazard thematic layers to identify the dynamic avalanche hazard sites. Conventional weighted approach and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) method have been implemented for the identification of AHZ that shows approximately 55% area under maximum hazard zone. Further, the results were validated by overlapping the existing registered avalanche sites. The sites were identified through field survey and avalanche data card followed by its delineation from the toposheet (1:50,000 scale). Interestingly study found that 28% area under moderate and maximum AHZ correlated well with registered avalanche sites when they were overlapped.

The study used observed precipitation data from fifty in-situ stations and reanalysis products from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction/the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) during 1981-2018. A suite of seven extreme precipitation indices and non-parametric statistical techniques were used to infer trends in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation indices. An increase in frequency and intensity of overall extreme indices was evident, with a maximum tendency in the country's northwestern (z-score=>2.5), central, and eastern (z-score > 4) monsoon-dominant parts. The northern and southwestern parts of the country exhibited a slight decrease (z-score <-2) in frequency and intensity. The Sen's Slope estimator (SSE) shows an increase in western parts (0.20 days) indicating a shift in the maxima of the monsoon precipitation. The regional precipitation shows an increase in wet days (R1 mm) with higher values of mMK (3.71) and SSE (0.3) in region 2 Similar results of moderate regional increase are evident for extreme indices except regions 1 and 3. The extreme 1-day maximum precipitation increased in region 3 (mMK: 1.39, SSE: 2.32). The extremely wet days (R99p TOT) precipitation has a moderate increase in all regions with a decrease in region 1. The temporal mutations showed dynamic changes, clearly reflecting the country's historical extreme events. The frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes negatively correlated with the altitude (R = -0.00039). The probability density function (PDF) showed a significant increase in the density during June and September with a probabilistic positive shift during July and August. The intensified mid-latitude westerlies and subtropical zonal easterlies teleconnections, strengthening of the monsoon trough, and land-ocean thermal contrast are the potential drivers of the increasing trend in precipitation extremes. The current study could serve as a benchmark for future researchers and policymakers to devise effective mitigation strategies for sustainable development.","[Ullah, Waheed] Rabdan Acad, Def & Secur, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Ullah, Waheed; Karim, Aisha; Wang, Guojie; Abbas, Adnan; Hagan, Daniel Fiffi Tawia; Zhu, Chenxia] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteorol, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Karim, Aisha; Ullah, Sami; Rehman, Atta-Ur] Univ Peshawar, Dept Geog, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Bibi, Tehmina] Univ Azad Jammu & Kashmir, Inst Geol, Muzaffarabad, Pakistan; [Ullah, Safi] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Environm Sci & Engn Program, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Ullah, Safi] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, KAUST Climate & Livabil Initiat CLI, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Bhatti, Asher Samuel] Bacha Khan Univ Charsadda, Dept Geol, Charsadda, Pakistan; [Ali, Gohar] Pakistan Meteorol Dept, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Nooni, Isaac Kwesi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Binjiang Coll, Wuxi, Peoples R China; [Hussain, Azfar] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Karst Geol, Int Res Ctr Karst Ausp UNESCO, Guilin, Peoples R China",,"Wang, GJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol NUIST, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteorol, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",gwang@nuist.edu.cn,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 8,2023,11.0,,,,,,,,1228817,10.3389/fenvs.2023.1228817,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1228817,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001069914200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Little is known about how different sources contribute to PAH concentrations at different elevations along mountain slopes. To estimate the distribution and sources of PAHs at different altitudes in mountainous areas of southwestern China, samples of soils and leaves from Keteleeria trees were collected from 1000 to 1500 m asl in the Dawangling forest and analyzed for PAHs. Total PAH concentrations ranged from 93.9 to 802.3 ng g(-1) (average, 252.3 ng g(-1)) in soils and from 4.1 to 100.9 ng g(-1) (average, 23.1 ng g(-1)) in leaves. Our results suggest that soil PAH levels in the study area could be classified as weakly contaminated. The PAH levels in leaves from the Dawangling forest were lower than those found in Himalayan spruce needles from the central Himalayas in China and from an agricultural station in southern England. Total PAHs in the Dawangling forest soils increased with elevation, primarily due to the low-molecular-weight PAHs, which accumulated in samples from higher altitudes. In contrast, high-molecular-weight PAHs were inversely related to or unrelated to elevation. The PAH profiles were similar in soils and leaves from all mountainous regions. Diagnostic ratios showed that the PAHs in soils at different altitudes were from different pollution emission sources; therefore, PAHs in the entire study area were probably derived from mixed sources. Cluster analyses confirmed that liquefied petroleum gas, coal/wood combustion, and petroleum combustion were likely the predominant PAH sources in this region.","[Shi, Bingfing; Wu, Qilin; Ouyang, Huixiang; Liu, Xixiang; Ma, Bo; Zuo, Weiyuan; Chen, Shengyu] Baise Univ, Dept Chem & Life Sci, Baise 533000, Guangxi, Peoples R China",,"Shi, BF (corresponding author), Baise Univ, Dept Chem & Life Sci, 21 2nd Zhongshan Rd, Baise 533000, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",shibingfang@126.com,,,,,,,,7.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV-DEC,2014,43.0,6,,,,,1942,1952,,10.2134/jeq2014.04.0177,http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2014.04.0177,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000345096000013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study evaluates the performance of original and location specific calibrated Hargreaves equation (HARG) with the estimates of Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Penman Monteith (PM) method for higher altitudes in East Sikkim, India. The results show that the uncalibrated HARG model underestimates ET (o) by 0.35 mm day(-1) whereas the results are significantly improved by regional calibration of the model. In addition, this paper also presents the variability in the trajectory associated with the climatic variables with the changing climate in the study site. Nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test was used to investigate and understand the mean monthly trend of eight climatic parameters including reference evapotranspiration (ET (o)) for the period of 1985 - 2009. Trend of ET (o) was estimated for the calculations done by FAO PM equation. The outcomes of the trend analysis show significant increasing (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) trend represented by higher Z-values, through MK test, for net radiation (Rn), maximum temperature (T (max)) and minimum temperature (T (min)), especially in the first months of the year.

Declining trend in sunshine duration, VPD and ET (o) is found in spring (March - May) and monsoon (June - November) season. The result displays significant (0.01a parts per thousand currency sign p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05) decreasing ET (o) trend between (June - December) except in July, exhibiting the positive relation with VPD followed by sunshine duration at the station. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of trend analysis of ET (o) and other climatic variables for efficient planning and managing the agricultural practices, in identifying the changes in the meteorological parameters and to accurately assess the hydrologic water balance of the hilly regions.","[Yadav, Shweta] Asian Inst Technol, Water Engn & Management, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand; [Deb, Proloy] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Ctr Water Climate & Land Use CWCL, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia; [Kumar, Sonu; Pandey, Pankaj Kumar] Northeastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Agr Engn, Nirjuli 791109, Arunachal Prade, India; [Pandey, Vanita] Coll Agr Engn & Post Harvest Technol, Dept Soil & Water Engn, Ranipool 737135, Sikkim, India",,"Yadav, S (corresponding author), Asian Inst Technol, Water Engn & Management, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand.;Deb, P (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Ctr Water Climate & Land Use CWCL, Fac Sci & Informat Technol, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.;Kumar, S; Pandey, PK (corresponding author), Northeastern Reg Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Agr Engn, Nirjuli 791109, Arunachal Prade, India.;Pandey, V (corresponding author), Coll Agr Engn & Post Harvest Technol, Dept Soil & Water Engn, Ranipool 737135, Sikkim, India.",shwtdv@gmail.com; debproloy@gmail.com; snu4ucau@gmail.com; vanita2@gmail.com; pandeypk@gmail.com,,,,,,,,26.0,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2016,13.0,2,,,,,302,315,,10.1007/s11629-014-3238-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-014-3238-3,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000370161700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

The NOAA AVHRR/2 provides a unique data source for long-term, large-spatial-scale monitoring of snow-covered areas at a daily scale. However, the value of AVHRR/2 in mapping snow-covered areas is limited, due to its lack of a shortwave infrared band for snow/cloud discrimination. We simulated the reflectance in the 3.75 mu m mid-infrared band with a radiative transfer model and then developed three fractional-snow-cover retrieval algorithms for AVHRR/2 imagery at 1 km and 5 km resolutions. These algorithms are based on the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis algorithm (MESMA), snow index (SI) algorithm, and non-snow/snow two endmember model (TEM) algorithm. Evaluation and comparison of these algorithms were performed using 313 scenarios that referenced snow-cover maps from Landsat-5/TM imagery at 30 m resolution. For all the evaluation data, the MESMA algorithm outperformed the other two algorithms, with an overall accuracy of 0.84 (0.85) and an RMSE of 0.23 (0.21) at the 1 km (5 km) scale. Regarding the effect of land cover type, we found that the three AVHRR/2 fractional-snow-cover retrieval algorithms have good accuracy in bare land, grassland, and Himalayan areas; however, the accuracy decreases in forest areas due to the shading of snow by the canopy. Regarding the topographic effect, the accuracy evaluation indices showed a decreasing and then increasing trend as the elevation increased. The accuracy was worst in the 4000-5000 m range, which was due to the severe snow fragmentation in the High Mountain Asia region; the early AVHRR/2 sensors could not effectively monitor the snow cover in this region. In this study, by increasing the number of bands of AVHRR/2 1 km data for fractional-snow-cover retrieval, a good foundation for subsequent long time series kilometre- resolution snow-cover monitoring has been laid.","[Pan, Fangbo; Jiang, Lingmei; Wang, Gongxue; Cui, Huizhen; Zhou, Xiaonan; Huang, Jinyu] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Pan, Fangbo; Jiang, Lingmei; Wang, Gongxue; Cui, Huizhen; Zhou, Xiaonan; Huang, Jinyu] Beijing Normal Univ, Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Zhaojun] China Meteorol Adm, Natl Satellite Meteorol Ctr, Satellite Meteorol Inst, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Gongxue] PLA Informat Engn Univ, Inst Geospatial Informat, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China",,"Jiang, LM (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Jiang, LM (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",panfb@mail.bnu.edu.cn; jiang@bnu.edu; zhengzj@cma.gov.cn; wanggx@mail.bnu.edu.cn; cuihz@mail.bnu.edu.cn; zhouxn@mail.bnu.edu.cn; huangjy@mail.bnu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,3.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2022,14.0,14,,,,,,,3303,10.3390/rs14143303,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14143303,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000831635800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To better understand the sources and build a proper mitigation strategy for PM10, we have segregated PM10 into PM1 and PM1-10 using the Anderson cascade impactor. A total of 620 sets of samples were collected during the entire study period. PM10 was found to remain within its Indian standard (60 mu gm- 3) in every year of the study period (long-term average PM10: 46 +/- 8 mu g m-3). PM10 pollution during winter (74.0 +/- 15.1 mu gm- 3) and premonsoon (73.1 +/- 12.1 mu g m- 3) was highest compared to other seasons. Bi-modal mass size distribution of composite PM10 was observed for all the seasons with maximum peak intensity at the finer mode (PM1). Most of the anthropogenic water-soluble ionic components as well as carbonaceous aerosols exhibited maximum intensity at PM1 too. PM10 exhibited a steady decrease from 2009 to 2013 but since 2014, a sharp rise was observed. Further, we have observed that premonsoon and winter-time PM1 pollution was the key factor for a such high rise in PM10. PM1 increased sharply at a rate of 4.1 mu gm- 3 yr- 1 in premonsoon and 3.3 mu gm- 3 yr- 1 in winter since 2014. Auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for future prediction revealed that PM10 would cross its Indian standard and PM1 alone would cross the PM2.5 standard in 2024 if the current scenario remains the same and the city would be enlisted among the non-attainment cities of the country under National Clean Air Program (NCAP) of Government of India. The Positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was run to apportion the sources of PM1 and PM10. It was observed that the vehicular emissions in premonsoon (33% in PM1; 28% in PM10; contribution of vehicular emission in PM1 to PM10 > 90%) and biomass burning in winter (27% in PM1; 23% in PM10; contribution of PM1 to PM10 > 80%) are the most influencing sources that need to be curbed to mitigate PM1 and hence PM10 pollution over Darjeeling.","[Ghosh, Abhinandan] IIT Kanpur, Ctr Environm Sci & Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Kanpur 201086, India; [Dutta, Monami; Chatterjee, Abhijit] Bose Inst, Environm Sci Sect, EN Block,Sect V, Kolkata 700091, India",,"Chatterjee, A (corresponding author), Bose Inst, Environm Sci Sect, EN Block,Sect V, Kolkata 700091, India.",abhijit.boseinst@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 1,2023,306.0,,,,,,,,119845,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119845,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119845,,MAY 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001001237100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The task is much more daunting in a risk-prone, fragile, and low productive hilly region due to the depletion of supporting and regulating ecosystem services. A five-year long-term (2012-2017) field experiment was conducted to stabilize the yield and soil quality through legume green manuring and crop residue recycling in intensified cropping systems in the Eastern Himalayan region of India. Four treatments involving three green manures [green gram (Vigna radiata); cowpea (Vigna unguiculata); Sesbania (Sesbania aculeata) along with control (no-green manure)], three cropping systems [groundnut (Arachis hypogaea)-pea (Pisum sativum); maize (Zea mays)-pea, and maize + groundnut-pea] and two levels of residue management practices [residue removal and residue retention] were evaluated in three times replicated split-split plot design. Among the green manure options, Sesbania exerted a significant positive impact on the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, available micro- (Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu), and macronutrients (N, P and K) in surface (0-0.15 m) and subsurface (0.15-0.45 m) soils. The improvement in soil enzymatic activities (acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, and aryl sulfatase activity) (p < 0.05) in Sesbania-treated soil was +28.1% to +38.9% in surface and +18.3% to +27.3% in subsurface soils over non-green manure. Sesbania-treated soils also exhibited higher soil quality index (SQI) and stratification ratio (SR) of available soil nutrients and enzymes over non-green manured soils. Among the cropping systems, groundnut intercropped with maize followed by peas (MGP) with in situ residue retention increased (p < 0.05) the available soil macro- and micronutrients, SOC stock, soil enzymes, SR, and SQI in comparison to other cropping systems. Sesbania green manuring and residue retention improved the yield sustainability by +19% and +11% in the MGP system over non-green manuring and residue removal, respectively.

Harsh in-stream environmental conditions (high discharge and stream water velocity) at the upstream site resulted in lower values of alpha diversity metrics. Despite statistically significant spatial variations, macroinvertebrates remained stable across seasons due to low taxa replacement and harshness of climatic factors. Multivariate dispersion homogeneity and composition analysis showed that the macroinvertebrate composition varied similarly among sites, with different compositions. Distance-based redundancy analysis indicated that water temperature, discharge, dissolved oxygen, pH and total phosphorus are major environmental factors determining the benthic macroinvertebrate diversity (alpha diversity) and composition (beta diversity) throughout the study area.","[Hamid, Aadil; Bhat, Sami Ullah] Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Aquat Ecol Lab, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Jehangir, Arshid] Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Terr Ecol Lab, Srinagar, India",,"Bhat, SU (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Aquat Ecol Lab, Srinagar 190006, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",samiullahbhat11@gmail.com,,,,,,,,7.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV 26,2021,37.0,9-10,,,,,746,766,,10.1080/02757540.2021.1987419,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2021.1987419,,OCT 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000706264600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

An adequate and diverse prey spectrum favours carnivore persistence. Prey depletion and habitat loss elicit conflict with humans and require sound conservation measures. We evaluated the conflict between common leopards and humans in a densely populated Himalayan forest area of Pakistan. In two decades, the local forests decreased at an average rate of 65.5 ha/year (6.6%), with a concomitant increase in areas covered by human settlements (81.5%) and agricultural lands (15.4%). Ranging movements of a GPS/GSM-radiotagged male leopard over 16 months encompassed an area inhabited by c. 124,000 people. Livestock dominated the leopard's diet (absolute frequency of occurrence: 80%), while wild ungulates were rarely eaten (absolute occurrence: 22%). Domestic goats were the most frequent diet item (61%), followed by domestic dogs (12%) and Bos spp. (6%). Wild prey included canids, small carnivores, rhesus monkeys, small mammals and gallinaceous birds. Socioeconomic implications of human-leopard coexistence were investigated: 18.5% of the households interviewed (N = 1016) suffered livestock depredation by leopards, with an overall loss of 123 USD/km(2)/year, in an area of 328 km(2). In the first c. 15 years of this century, about 2 attacks to humans/year were recorded, half of which were lethal, whereas c. 6 leopards/year were killed in retaliation. The common leopard is 'critically endangered' in Pakistan mainly because of habitat loss and concurrent prey depletion. To increase the long-term survival of leopards and mitigate human-carnivore conflicts, priority should be given to restoration of a diverse natural prey assembly and protection of forest habitats, together with improved livestock management practices and livestock compensation. The latter will require a sustainable financial mechanism.","[Khan, U.; Lovari, S.; Ferretti, F.] Univ Siena, Dept Life Sci, Res Unit Behav Ecol Ethol & Wildlife Management, Via PA Mattioli 4, I-53100 Siena, Italy; [Khan, U.] WWF Pakistan, Lahore, Pakistan; [Lovari, S.] Maremma Nat Hist Museum, Str Corsini, I-58100 Grosseto, Italy; [Shah, S.

The highest green cob yield of maize was produced under the chemical check treatment (10323 kg/ha). Statistically equivalent green cob yield was produced under RSSB + hoeing, that was 9208 kg/ha. While considering the system as a whole, it was found that intercropping followed by chemical control and RSSB + hoeing produced the most energy from the crops' primary products. Crop rotation treatment combined with RSSB resulted in significantly greater energy use efficiency (12.3%).

However, many questions regarding sediment transport patterns and their controlling factors at different time scales remain unanswered. Therefore, in the present study, a gravity core named BoB-79, based on the southern Bay of Bengal (BoB) was selected to investigate sediment provenance shift and its corresponding mechanism to sedimentary environment change since the last glacial maximum (LGM). The clay mineral compositions are analyzed and the whole core sediments reveal a feature dominated by illite (similar to 55%), followed by chlorite (similar to 24%) and kaolinite (similar to 17%), and the content of smectite (similar to 4%) is the lowest. A trigonometric analysis of provenance discrimination of clay minerals showed that the Himalayas, together with the Indian Peninsula, represent the main sources of southern BoB sediments, and the last glacial period might have been controlled by the dominant Himalayan provenance, with an average contribution of approximately 90%. However, as a secondary source, the influence of the Indian Peninsula increased significantly during the Holocene, and its mean contribution was 24%, thus, indicating that it had a crucial effect on the evolution process of BoB. The sediment transportation pattern changed significantly from the LGM to the Holocene: in the last glacial period, the low sea level exposed the shelf area that caused the Ganges River connected with the largest submarine canyon in BoB named Swatch of No Ground (SoNG), and the Himalayan materials could be transported to the BoB directly under a strong turbidity current, thereby forming the deep sea deposition center with a sedimentation rate of 4.5 cm/kyr. Following Holocene, the sea level increased significantly, and the materials from multiple rivers around the BoB were directly imported into the continental shelf area. The intensive Indian summer monsoon dominated the transportation process of the terrestrial materials, thereby forming a deposition center in the shallow water area of the continental shelf northeast Indian Ocean; subsequently, the material flux relative to the input to the deep sea area decreased significantly, and the sedimentation rate in the southern BoB decreased to 1.7 cm/kyr.","[Liu, Shengfa; Ye, Wenxing; Zhang, Hui; Cao, Peng; Li, Xiaoyan; Fang, Xisheng; Shi, Xuefa] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Marine Geol & Metallogeny, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shengfa; Zhang, Hui; Cao, Peng; Li, Jingrui; Li, Xiaoyan; Fang, Xisheng; Shi, Xuefa] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Ye, Wenxing] Ocean Univ China, Coll Marine Geosci, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xingquan] Jimo Dist Bur Nat Resources, Qingdao, Peoples R China; [Khokiattiwong, Somkiat; Kornkanitnan, Narumol] Minist Nat Resources & Environm, Dept Marine & Coastal Resources, Marine & Coastal Resources Res & Dev Inst, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Liu, SF; Shi, XF (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 1, Key Lab Marine Geol & Metallogeny, Qingdao, Peoples R China.;Liu, SF; Shi, XF (corresponding author), Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Lab Marine Geol, Qingdao, Peoples R China.",liushengfa@fio.org.cn; xfshi@fio.org.cn,,,,,,,,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 24,2023,10.0,,,,,,,,1106663,10.3389/fmars.2023.1106663,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1106663,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000926386900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This paper reports on the results of two case studies from high mountain areas, one in the Upper Beas River watershed of the Indian Himalaya, and the other in the Arrow Lakes area of the Canadian Cordillera. Specifically, this paper describes sustainability indicators which were enumerated by local people in two differing cultural-historical, but environmentally similar, contexts. These indicators may be reflective of local, indigenous knowledge about the environment and therefore may be of significance in impact assessment and monitoring environmental change. Results from the Upper Beas watershed reveal a highly discriminated set of indicators which may be grouped as: forest cover indicators; forest-linked indicators; forest management indicators; agricultural livelihood indicators; and socioeconomic indicators. Local people demonstrated a very precise knowledge of the state of the biophysical resources of their village use areas. Specific indicators identified include: forest cover area (decreasing), forest species diversity (some species such as deodar decreasing), forest tree density (decreasing), consistency of water flow (decreasing) and frequency of avalanches and slides (increasing). These are all indicators which can be measured and verified independently of local knowledge. All suggest declining sustainability. Residents in the Arrow Lakes area demonstrated much less precise knowledge of biophysical indicators of sustainability. They enumerated a set of indicators which emphasized institutional arrangements for forest and resource management. For example, few respondents identified the extent of forest cover as important whereas the majority identified forest/land use rules in place as being important indicators of sustainability. in both case studies, people mentioned a number of socioeconomic factors as being important indicators of sustainability.","Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; Univ Delhi, Dept Geog, New Delhi, India",,"Univ Manitoba, Nat Resources Inst, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada.",,,,,,,,,18.0,23.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,1998,18.0,1,,,,,35,49,,10.2307/3673866,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3673866,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000072195200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

CALIOP-derived aerosol properties show vertically elevated aerosol profiles (up to 4 km altitude), majorly consisting of dust particles during all three PrM seasons with maximum loading in May, 2008. The above inference is well corroborated with columnar aerosol properties from MODIS and AERONET observations. The results also show higher aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Delhi as compared to Kanpur The high aerosol loading found during the late PrM season at both locations can be attributed to the fact that dust/burning activities are at their peak in May during the PrM season over the IGB. The analyses of optical and microphysical parameters coupled with backward trajectory analyses indicate the presence of three different aerosol types (Type I, Type II and Type III) over both cities during PrM 2009. Type I is characterized as dust-dominated aerosols coming via long-range transportation from major dust sources (desert of Sahara, Iran, Afghanistan and western India), whereas a mixture of absorbing aerosols and dust coming from the Arabian Peninsula and the Thar Desert is characterized as Type II aerosols. The presence of highly absorbing, fine mode dominated Type III aerosols are categorized as urban-industrial/biomass burning aerosols, mainly locally originated and/or influenced by agriculture fires in the Himalayan foothills. A combination of CALIOP and PARASOL observations with ground-based measurements also highlights the dominance of biomass burning smoke (mixed with polluted continental) over the IGB during the middle of May in 2009. The variability in aerosol types found during the PrM season indicates the significant effect of natural/human activities, associated with different meteorological conditions, on aerosol behavior over the region.","[Mishra, Amit Kumar; Shibata, Takashi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Srivastava, Arun] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India; [Mishra, Amit Kumar] Weizmann Inst Sci, Dept Environm Sci & Energy Res, IL-76100 Rehovot, Israel",,"Mishra, AK (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",amit.mishra.jnu@gmail.com,,,,,,,,10.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2014,14.0,3,,,,,767,782,,10.4209/aaqr.2013.03.0083,http://dx.doi.org/10.4209/aaqr.2013.03.0083,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000333743900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two recent satellite rainfall estimates (SREs) from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)-era-Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG-V06) and gauge calibrated Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP-V07) are evaluated for their spatiotemporal accuracy and ability to capture extreme precipitation events using 279 gauge stations from southern slope of central Himalaya, Nepal, between 2014 and 2019. The overall result suggests that both SREs can capture the spatiotemporal precipitation variability, although they both underestimated the observed precipitation amount. Between the two, the IMERG product shows a more consistent performance with a higher correlation coefficient (0.52) and smaller bias (-2.49 mm/day) than the GSMaP product. It is worth mentioning that the monthly gauge-calibrated IMERG product yields better detection capability (higher probability of detection (POD) values) of daily precipitation events than the daily gauge calibrated GSMaP product; however, they both show similar performance in terms of false alarm ratio (FAR) and critical success index (CSI). Assessment based on extreme precipitation indices revealed that the IMERG product outperforms GSMaP in capturing daily precipitation extremes (RX1Day and RX5Day). In contrast, the GSMaP product tends to be more consistent in capturing the duration and threshold-based precipitation extremes (consecutive dry days (CDD), consecutive wet days (CWD), number of heavy precipitation days (R10mm), and number of extreme precipitation days (R25mm)). Therefore, it is suggested that the IMERG product can be a good alternative for monitoring daily extremes; meanwhile, GSMaP could be a better option for duration-based extremes in the mountainous region.","[Nepal, Bikash] Govt Nepal, Dept Hydrol & Meteorol, Kathmandu 406, Nepal; [Nepal, Bikash; Shrestha, Dibas; Sharma, Shankar; Aryal, Deepak] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Hydrol & Meteorol, Kathmandu 44613, Nepal; [Shrestha, Mandira Singh] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Khumaltar 44700, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Shrestha, Nitesh] World Food Programme, Lalitpur 44600, Nepal",,"Shrestha, D (corresponding author), Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Hydrol & Meteorol, Kathmandu 44613, Nepal.",bikash.nepal@nepal.gov.np; dibas@cdhmtu.edu.np; shankarsharma@cdhmtu.edu.np; mandira.shrestha@icimod.org; deepak@cdhmtu.edu.np; nitesh.shrestha@wfp.org,,,,,,,,32.0,33.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,12.0,2,,,,,,,254,10.3390/atmos12020254,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12020254,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000622159500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Reach-specific channel morphodynamics is measured through training the observed dataset using the autoregressive integrated moving average model where the root mean squared error found at the best-fit model scenario was considered as the measure of relative variations in the morphometric variables. Channel reaches under direct structural control are morphologically most unstable where the faultline-induced possible sedimentation controls the fluvio-geomorphic processes intensively. The nature of morphological adjustment varies on different surface gradients but local variations in structural setup determine its spatial nature. The temporal variations of channel morphological parameters are responsive to peak discharge strength coupled with controls of channel gradient. Moreover, channel morphological change to hydrological variation is more sensitive on the piedmont surface compared to low gradient plain. This research contributes towards a close understanding of reach-specific channel morphological behaviour which is important while predicting its future and implementation of any river management strategies.","[Saha, U.

The cumulative impacts of livestock grazing, fuel wood extraction and other anthropogenic pressures on forest cover in and around camping sites have been analyzed using satellite data and field observations. Multi-date satellite data were used to map the forest cover around 16 seasonal livestock camps. An annual loss of about 7.25 ha of forest covers during 1976-1990, 13.57 ha during 1990-1999 and 11.46 ha during 1999-2005 are recorded. A loss of 108.53 ha of forestland has been estimated during 1976-1990, about 122.16 ha during 1990-1999 and 68.78 ha during 1999-2005. It is also observed that many of the isolated camping sites are now connected due to loss of vegetation. Phytosociological analysis indicates that the number of seedlings and saplings in three species of Quercus (Q. leucotrichophora, Q. floribunda and Q. semecarpifolia) as compared to mature tress is very less around cattle camping sites. The ratio of number of sapling with seedling and trees indicates that the status of sapling is nil to very poor, an indication of loss of saplings due to either trampling or grazing.","[Thakur, Arun K.; Singh, Sarnam] ISRO, NRSC, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun 248001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Gajendra; Rawat, G.

Although the Indian monsoon and westerlies are generally regarded as the primary carriers of pollutants to this region via the heavily industrialized Indo-Gangetic Plain, the concentrations of total suspended particles (TSP) and HgP in Kathmandu were higher than those in Dhulikhel, thus suggesting a substantial contribution from local sources. Both isotopic (delta 200Hg and Delta 199Hg) and non-isotopic evidence indicated that dust, waste burning, and industrial byproducts (without Hg amalgamation) were the major sources of Hg in Kathmandu during the study period. Mercury may have been transported via air masses from Kathmandu to Dhulikhel, as indicated by the similar organic carbon/ elemental carbon ratios and seasonal trends of TSP and HgP in these two locations. Local anthropogenic sources were found to contribute significantly to atmospheric Hg pollution through dust resuspension. Therefore, dust resuspension should be considered when evaluating the long-range transport of air pollutants such as Hg, particularly in anthropogenically stressed areas.","[Guo, Junming; Sharma, Chhatra Mani; Tripathee, Lekhendra; Kang, Shichang; Chen, Pengfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Sharma, Chhatra Mani] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Environm Sci, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Tripathee, Lekhendra] Himalayan Environm Res Inst HERI, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Kang, Shichang] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Kang, Shichang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Fu, Xuewu] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Environm Geochem, 99 Lincheng West Rd, Guiyang 550081, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shrestha, Kundan Lal] Kathmandu Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Dhulikhel, Nepal",,"Tripathee, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",lekhendra.t@gmail.com,,,,,,,,14.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 1,2021,286.0,,,,,,,,117317,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117317,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117317,,MAY 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000688586700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite aforesaid advantages these fans are hitherto not studied. Thus, the present study is an attempt to understand the morphology of these fans and explore factors affecting fan morphology, primarily through morphometry. Data were derived from various satellite imageries, topographical sheets, DEM and field observations. Various parameters of 51 fans and of their basins were measured and relationships among different parameters were examined. The results of the study are generally comparable to literature though these fans are much steeper than their counterparts in similar environmental settings. Multi-proxy approach was used to explore controlling factors. Fan Conicality Index (FCI) and sweep angle of fan (S-A ) suggest confinement imposed by surrounding environment has considerably reduced the size of these fans. Further, valley-floor width to height ratio (V-f ), feeder channel and geological group-wise analyses reveal that active tectonic attitude, order of feeder channel, lithology and characteristics of contributing basin along with associated depositional processes exercise significant control on morphology of these fans.","[Shoshta, Amit] Govt Coll, Dept Geog, Bhoranj, Himachal Prades, India; [Marh, Bhupinder S.] Himachal Pradesh Univ, Dept Geog, Shimla, Himachal Prades, India",,"Shoshta, A (corresponding author), Govt Coll, Dept Geog, Bhoranj, Himachal Prades, India.",amitshoshta189@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 4,2023,44.0,2,,,,,136,161,,10.1080/02723646.2021.1907883,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.2021.1907883,,APR 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000635440000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This site is characterized by several carbon dioxide discharges having maximum fluxes larger than 10 kg m(-2) d(-1). Radon concentration was monitored with autonomous Barasol (TM) probes between January 2008 and November 2009 in two small natural cavities with high CO2 concentration and at six locations in the soil: four points having a high flux, and two background reference points. At the reference points, dominated by radon diffusion, radon concentration was stable from January to May, with mean values of 22 +/- 6.9 and 37 +/- 5.5 kBq m(-3), but was affected by a large increase, of about a factor of 2 and 1.6, respectively, during the monsoon season from June to September. At the points dominated by CO2 advection, by contrast, radon concentration showed higher mean values 39.0 +/- 2.6 to 78 +/- 1.4 kBq m(-3), remarkably stable throughout the year with small long-term variation, including a possible modulation of period around 6 months. A significant difference between the diffusion dominated reference points and the advection-dominated points also emerged when studying the diurnal Si and semi-diurnal S-2 periodic components. At the advection-dominated points, radon concentration did not exhibit S-1 or S-2 components. At the reference points, however, the S2 component, associated with barometric tide, could be identified during the dry season, but only when the probe was installed at shallow depth. The S-1 component, associated with thermal and possibly barometric diurnal forcing, was systematically observed, especially during monsoon season. The remarkable short-term and long-term temporal stability of the radon concentration at the advection-dominated points, which suggests a strong pressure source at depth, may be an important asset to detect possible temporal variations associated with the seismic cycle.

This study has attempted to show the relationship of the SRIR runoff with the regional meteorological and global oceanic indices. The monotonic Mann-Kendal, Sen Slope, and wavelet analysis were employed to assess the trends and periodicity in the hydro-meteorological variables. Monthly runoff from all sub-basins shows increasing trends from October to March and decreases from April to September, except for western tributaries. Most sub-basins in the SRIR are experiencing significant increases in winter while decreases in summer. The annual runoff trend suggests an increase after 2000 from the Kabul River Basin (KRB). However, contrasting results are evident in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB). The Jhelum River Basin (JRB) has shown a significant declining trend since the mid-1990s. Annual runoff (3.19 m3/s), precipitation (0.24 mm/ year), temperature (0.011 degrees C/year), and NDVI (0.002) increased in the SRIR, whereas PET (-0.020 mm/year) and NDSI (-0.003) declined during 1970-2016. In general, built-up grassland, snow/ice, water bodies, and wetlands increased, while barren land, cropland, and forest/shrubland declined between 2001 and 2018. Overall, all the factors displayed a positive correlation with runoff. Generally, runoff has a stronger association with regional environmental factors than global, as evident in correlation and wavelet analysis, which implies that local factors had a more significant effect on runoff. However, NAO, AO, and ISMI shared a significant correlation other than the regional environmental factors concerning the oceanic indices. The warmer and wetter climate hastened the melting of snow/glaciers via runoff variation, and rising water inputs may have had a secondary impact on the SRIR. These findings have significant implications for decision-makers seeking to enhance water resource planning and operations in the SRIR in the context of future water management.","[Hussain, Azfar; Wu, Xiuqin; Zhou, Jinxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Jianshui Res Stn, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hussain, Azfar; Wu, Xiuqin; Zhou, Jinxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Key Lab State Forestry & Grassland Adm Soil & Wate, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cao, Jianhua] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Karst Geol, Guilin, Peoples R China; [Ali, Shaukat] Minist Climate Change, Global Change Impact Study Ctr, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Ullah, Waheed] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteorol, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Muhammad, Sher] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Hussain, Ishtiaq] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Appl Math, Chungli, Taiwan; [Rezaei, Abolfazl] Inst Adv Studies Basic Sci, Dept Earth Sci, Zanjan, Iran; [Rezaei, Abolfazl] Inst Adv Studies Basic Sci, Ctr Res Climate Change & Global Warming, Zanjan, Iran; [Hamal, Kalpana] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Int Ctr Climate & Environm Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Akhtar, Mobeen] Peking Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & GIS, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Abbas, Haider] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Synth Res Ctr Chinese Ecosyst Res Network, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modelling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Jinxing] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Zhou, JX (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Soil & Water Conservat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zjx001@bjfu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,16.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2022,140.0,,,,,,,,109014,10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109014,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109014,,JUN 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000810733000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Qomolangma (Mt. Everest),ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Weather and climatic conditions over the Himalaya regions are of great interest to the scientific community at large. The objective of this study is to present spatial and temporal variations of air temperatures and relative humidity on the north slope of Mt. Qomolangma. Both hourly air temperatures and relative humidity were measured at seven automatic weather stations (AWS) from 5207 to 7028 m a.s.l. from May 2007 through September 2008. Long-term (1959-2007) air temperature and precipitation data were obtained from Dingri Meteorological Station. The preliminary results show that the elevational gradient of mean annual air temperature is non-linear, which decreases from 0.2 degrees C at an elevation of 5207 m to -4.4 degrees C at 5792 m, and -5.4 degrees C at 5955 m. The maxima are 14.6, 9.1, and 18.6 degrees C, and the minima are -24.2, -28.8, and -29.3 degrees C at the three elevations, respectively. The relative humidity does not change significantly with increasing elevation except over glacier ice, but the mixing ratio decreases due to the decrease in air temperature. The mean diurnal ranges of air temperature and relative humidity decrease with increasing elevation. The daily maximum air temperature occurs significantly later at the high-elevation site than that at the low elevation site because the air temperature at the high-elevation site is affected to a large extent by downward mixing of warm air near the ablation zone of the glacier during daytime. The air moisture content reflects the pronounced alternation of the wet and dry seasons, and the highest water vapor content is associated with the southwesterly Indian monsoon. The mean annual surface air temperature-elevation gradient is 0.72 +/- 0.01 degrees C (100 m)(-1), and also shows a pronounced seasonal signature. Mean annual air temperatures have increased by about 0.62 degrees C per decade over the last 49 years in this region; the greatest warming trend is observed in winter, the smallest in summer. Warmer conditions have been observed since the mid-1980s. Additional studies have shown a reduction in precipitation in the 1960s that resulted in a decrease in net snow accumulation. Therefore, accelerated retreat of the Rongbuk Glacier since the 1980s may be caused by rising air temperature and the decreased precipitation.","[Yang, Xingguo; Qin, Dahe; Kang, Shichang; Qin, Xiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tingjun] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Res Inst, State Key Lab Frozen Soil Engn, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tingjun] Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Natl Snow & Ice Data Ctr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Kang, Shichang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, TJ (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Cooperat Inst Res Environm Sci, Natl Snow & Ice Data Ctr, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",tzhang@nsidc.org,,,,,,,,40.0,43.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2011,43.0,1,,,,,147,160,,10.1657/1938-4246-43.1.147,http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-43.1.147,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000288633400015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, climate anomalies might provide opportunities to identify the relationship of past climate in deriving the distribution of invasive species and to detect their probable future distribution. In this work, we studied the correlation of climate anomaly i.e. temperature and precipitation with an indicative map of plant invasive species (1 degrees grid) of India. The indicative map was generated through the plant data available from the project Biodiversity Characterization at Landscape Level'. Climate anomaly was calculated and represented by average temperature and precipitation using Climate Research Unit' data for the period of 1901 to 2000. A comparison of local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and a global ordinary least square regression (OLS) model was carried out for statistical analysis to depict the correlation at 1 degrees spatial grids. Overall, 20,501 records with a total of 9112 unique plots and 161 unique invasive species were recorded in the database that shows a maximum of 15 invasive species in a 0.04ha nested quadrat. Cumulative analysis showed a maximum of 53 invasive species at 1 degrees grid. Individually, GWR could reveal a significant correlation with invasive species distribution for temperature anomaly (r(2)=0.73, AIC=2206) and precipitation anomaly (r(2)=0.74, AIC=2221), while OLS model did not offer a good correlation (r(2)<0.001, AIC>2400) compared to GWR. Combination of temperature and precipitation anomaly (shared model) showed an improved spatial correlation (r(2)>0.75) using GWR. Variation partitioning revealed the dominant influence (>0.40 of variation) of temperature anomaly over Deccan Peninsula, Himalaya and North East zone. Influence of precipitation anomaly was more prominent over arid and semi-arid zone explaining >0.35 of variation. Results revealed the strength of GWR to see the interaction of invasive plant species w.r.t. climate anomalies that explain the influence of spatial variation due to heterogeneity at varying neighbour distances. The significant correlation of invasive species with both the anomalies revealed the affinity of invasive species towards warmer, drier and wet places. This gives an indication that the distribution of invasive species could be triggered by climate anomaly. The use of other predictor variables (i.e. edaphic and anthropogenic) could be an inclusive input in a future perspective.","[Tripathi, Poonam] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Tripathi, Poonam; Behera, Mukunda Dev] Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Ctr Oceans Rivers Atmosphere & Land Sci CORAL, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India; [Roy, Partha Sarathi] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Innovat Syst Dry Lands, Syst Anal Climate Smart Agr, Hyderabad 502324, India",,"Tripathi, P (corresponding author), Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev, GPO Box 3226, Kathmandu, Nepal.;Tripathi, P (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Kharagpur, Ctr Oceans Rivers Atmosphere & Land Sci CORAL, Kharagpur 721302, W Bengal, India.",tripathy.poonam@gmail.com; mukundbehera@gmail.com; R.Parthsarathi@cgiar.org,,,,,,,,9.0,10.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2019,28.0,8-9,,,SI,,2049,2062,,10.1007/s10531-019-01711-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-019-01711-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000470665000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

The performance of the summer monsoon rainfall of 2013 over Indian meteorological sub-divisions is assessed at different temporal scales. Comparison of daily accumulated rainfall over India from IMSRA shows a linear correlation of 0.72 with TMPA-3B42 and 0.70 with GSMaP estimates. IMSRA is capable to pick up daily rainfall variability over the monsoon trough region as compared to TMPA-3B42 and GSMaP products, but underestimates moderate to heavy rainfall events. Satellite-derived rainfall maps at meteorological sub-divisional scales are in reasonably good agreement with IMD-SRG based rainfall maps with some exceptions. However, IMSRA performs better than GSMaP product at meteorological sub-divisional scale and comparable with TMPA data. All the satellite-derived rainfall products underestimate orographic rainfall along the west coast, the Himalayan foothills and over the northeast India and overestimate rainfall over the southeast peninsular India. Overall results suggest that IMSRA estimates have potential for monsoon rainfall monitoring over the Indian meteorological sub-divisions and can be used for various hydro-meteorological applications.","[Bushair, M.

It becomes necessary to continuously monitor and understand the distribution of aerosol loading over the Indian landmass, as it might have serious health and climatic implications. Whereas there have been extensive studies reporting seasonal distribution and trends of columnar aerosol amounts over the Indian region using data from ground based as well as space borne measurements, in-depth studies on the aerosol vertical profile distribution and in particular, seasonal trends are still lacking. This paper demonstrates the seasonal variability of aerosol vertical structure over the Indian mainland using decadal daily datasets (2009-2018) from CALIOP Lidar (onboard NASA-CNES's CALIPSO satellite) augmented by the variability in columnar AOD from MODIS (onboard NASA's AQUA and TERRA platforms). The changing aerosol amounts in both vertical and total column levels have also been presented. Over Indian landmass, we could find statistically significant increasing trends in aerosol extinction within lower altitude levels during all the seasons. The trends in the vertical distribution of aerosols are also compared with respect to trends in AOD derived from MODIS (Aqua/Terra). Additionally, we have also examined the seasonal variability and trends of aerosol extinction over five selected cities (based on pollution and population levels) of the country.","[Mehta, Manu; Khushboo, Richa; Raj, Rahesh] ISRO, IIRS, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Khushboo, Richa] Univ Kalyani, Kalyani, W Bengal, India; [Raj, Rahesh] IIITM, Trivandrum, Kerala, India; [Singh, Narendra] ARIES, Manora Peak, Nainital, India",,"Mehta, M (corresponding author), ISRO, IIRS, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.",manu@iirs.gov.in,,,,,,,,18.0,19.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN 1,2021,244.0,,,,,,,,117902,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117902,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.117902,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000591727900005,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sampling was carried out for two seasons, pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM), at 16 locations distributed over the entire Tawi watershed. The physico-chemical variables like water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, TDS, total alkalinity, total hardness, DO, BOD, COD, nitrate, and phosphate were analyzed. The seasonal distribution of the pollution-tolerant algal genera and species was recorded and the algal pollution index for both genus (AGP index) and species (ASP index) was also calculated. The concentration of BOD, COD, and nitrate in the sampled river water was found to be higher during the PRM season as compared to the POM season. The lower stretch of the watershed (Jammu Sub-Watershed) falls in class IV-V as per the polluted river stretch priority ranking based on BOD levels as BOD levels are >3 mg/L in the downstream locations during both seasons. A total of 23 algal taxa belonging to 8 families, Chlorophyceae (4 algal genera), Cyanophyceae (2 algal genera), Bacillariophyceae (7 algal genera), Zygnematophyceae (3 algal genera), Trebouxiophyceae (2 algal genera), Ulvophyceae (1 algal genus), Mediophyceae (1 algal genus), and Euglenophyceae (3 algal genera), have been reported in the Tawi watershed. The results of the Palmer indices showed a lack of organic pollution in the upstream, varying pollution levels in the midstream, and partially high to very high organic pollution levels in the downstream of the watershed. Comparative temporal analysis of the distribution of pollution-tolerant algal genera and species showed more organic pollution during PRM. Navicula and Cymbella were found to be the most abundant genera in almost all the stations, whereas Ulothrix, Cocconeis, Anacystis, and Crucigenia were the least recorded genera in the entire watershed. The results will enhance the understanding of the health status of the watershed, and provide database for watershed vulnerability assessment for sustainability and watershed management with spatio-temporal improvement.","[Kour, Gagandeep; Dhar, Sunil; Pathania, Deepak; Kothari, Richa] Cent Univ Jammu, Dept Environm Sci, Samba 181143, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Tyagi, Inderjeet] Zool Survey India, Mol Systemat Div, Ctr DNA Taxon, M Block,New Alipore, Kolkata 700053, India; [Kumari, Sarita] Sardar Patel Univ, Dept Zool, Mandi 175001, Himachal Prades, India",,"Kothari, R (corresponding author), Cent Univ Jammu, Dept Environm Sci, Samba 181143, Jammu & Kashmir, India.",kothariricha21@gmail.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2023,195.0,12,,,,,,,1402,10.1007/s10661-023-11975-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11975-3,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001098035600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The increasing trend of CAGR has boosted the tourism economy in the state while impacting the local environment. The negative impacts have recently increased due to changes in climatic patterns and increased tourism influx during the post-pandemic period. In this context, the present study analyzed the impact of tourism on the environment, economy, and energy consumption using the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The novelty of this study is to the existing literature on sustainable tourism development through investigating the interrelationship between tourism, environment, economy, energy consumption, and carbon emissions by employing the Toda-Yamamoto (TY) technique. This study will be a pioneering scientific investigation with quantitative results in the western Himalayan states of India, encompassing Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh. The annual data for each variable, such as per capita carbon emission (CEP), per capita Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), per capita GSDP square, per capita energy consumption (ECP), and per capita tourism receipts (TRP), was collected from 2010 to 2021. This study exhibited an inverted-U EKC in the state, signifying the initial stage of economic development and extensive exploitation of natural resources for tourism. The TY results indicated an inter-causal relationship and feedback association among the variables in the study area. Thus, increased TRP would lead to an upsurge in energy consumption affecting the environmental quality due to increased carbon emissions. Such environmental degradation in the state would negatively impact the tourism sector in the long run. The research findings would guide planners and policymakers in promoting sustainable tourism.","[Manisha, Keerti; Singh, Inderpal] Natl Inst Technol, Dept Architecture, Hamirpur 177005, Himachal Prades, India; [Manisha, Keerti] Christ, Sch Architecture, Mysore Rd, Bangalore 560074, Karnataka, India; [Chettry, Vishal] Indian Inst Technol BHU Varanasi, Dept Architecture Planning & Design, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Manisha, K (corresponding author), Natl Inst Technol, Dept Architecture, Hamirpur 177005, Himachal Prades, India.;Manisha, K (corresponding author), Christ, Sch Architecture, Mysore Rd, Bangalore 560074, Karnataka, India.",ar.keertimanisha@gmail.com; ipsingh05@gmail.com; vishalchettry33@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,2023 DEC 14,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s10668-023-04252-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-04252-3,,DEC 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001122247200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For twenty-four stations spread across the study area, the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator, version six (LARS-WG6), was used to downscale the daily data from the six different RCMs for maximum temperature (T-max), minimum temperature (T-min), and precipitation (pr) at a spatial resolution of 0.44 degrees. Investigations were made to predict changes in mean annual values of T-max, T-min, and precipitation during two future periods, i.e., the mid-century (2041-2070) and end-century (2071-2100). The model results from statistical and graphical comparison validated that the LARS-WG6 can simulate the temperature and the precipitation in the UIB. Each of the six RCMs and their ensemble revealed a continuously increased temperature projection in the basin; nevertheless, there is variation in projected magnitude across RCMs and between RCPs. The rise in average T-max and T-min was more significant under RCP 8.5 than RCP 4.5, possibly due to unmitigated greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). The precipitation projections follow the non-uniform trend, i.e., not all RCMs agree on whether the precipitation will increase or decrease in the basin, and no orderly variations were detected during any future periods under any RCP. However, an overall increase in precipitation is projected by the ensemble of RCMs.","[Khan, Summera Fahmi; Naeem, Usman Ali] Univ Engn & Technol, Taxila, Pakistan; [Khan, Summera Fahmi] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Wah Campus, Wah Cantt, Pakistan",,"Khan, SF (corresponding author), Univ Engn & Technol, Taxila, Pakistan.",fahmi.wah@gmail.com; usman.naeem@uettaxila.edu.pk,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2023,195.0,7,,,,,,,810,10.1007/s10661-023-11419-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11419-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001003009000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Landsat TM and OLI images for 1990 and 2015 were utilized to evaluate the changes in forest cover. The frequency ratio model was used for deforestation susceptibility mapping. The extent of deforestation was examined by overlaying forest fragmentation map and deforestation susceptibility map. The results showed that about 112.5 km(2) forest area has been deforested over the last 25 years. Of the total existing forest, nearly 10% area falls under very high, 17% under high and 30% under moderate deforestation susceptibility categories. Patch, edge and perforated have influenced high (64%) and very high (81%) deforestation susceptibility zones.

(2) The seasonal variation of inorganic ion concentration is very obvious. Ion concentration is high in winter and spring, but low in summer and autumn. (3) Because erosion and transport of rock weathering by runoff process are the main source of runoff ion, the ion concentration in watershed water varies significantly in space, gradually enriched with altitude from high to low, especially Ca2+, HCO3-.

This study was conducted during 2018 to 2020 to investigate the climatic effects on flowering cycle of plants. The main focus of the study was to find out the particular association between flowering phenology of plants and climatic variables. Month-wise phenological response of plants was recorded during frequent field visits at multiple representative microhabitats. The response data is saved as binary data matrix, and mean monthly climatic data is obtained through remote sensing, and analysed by using multivariate analyses like canonical correspondence analysis, hierarchical classification and pseudo canonical correlation. CCA and Hierarchical classification were applied to assess the importance climatic variations towards the flowering phenological response and potential groups respectively. A total of 404 plant species of 223 genera belonging to 75 plant families were examined. Majority of plant species were found in flowering during the month of March (174 spp.) followed by April (159 spp.) and August (158 spp.), similarly, Summer was the leading season (208 spp.) followed by Monsoon (203 spp.), Spring (181 spp.) and Autumn (157 spp.). CCA results depicted that total variations in the flowering phenology response data were 3.45084, and about 45.6% were explained by the explanatory climatic variables. Wind speed, mean monthly maximum temperature and soil moisture were detected as most influential drivers of flowering phenology in the study area. The current study will be useful for researchers as a major source of knowledge for the conservation of valuable species. Such type of attempts will be supportive to explore the phenological response of plants in various habitats such as forest, hilly, riverine, desert and range lands flora in their future projects.","[Majeed, M.; Bhatti, K.

In this study, the chemical characteristics of the thermal waters are investigated to identify the main geochemical processes affecting the composition of thermal waters during its ascent toward the surface as well as to determine the subsurface temperature of the feeding reservoir. The thermal waters are mainly Ca-Mg-HCO3 type with moderate silica and TDS concentrations. Mineral saturation states calculated from PHREEQC geochemical code indicate that thermal waters are supersaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite, aragonite, chalcedony, quartz (SI[ 0), and undersaturated with respect to gypsum, anhydrite, and amorphous silica (SI < 0). XRD study of the spring deposit samples fairly corroborates the predicted mineral saturation state of the thermal waters. Stable isotopes (delta O-18, delta H-2) data confirm the meteoric origin of the thermal waters with no oxygen-18 shift. The mixing phenomenon between thermal water with shallow ground water is substantiated using tritium (H-3) and chemical data. The extent of dilution is quantified using tritium content of thermal springs and non-thermal waters. Classical geothermometers, mixing model, and multicomponent fluid geothermometry modeling (GeoT) have been applied to estimate the subsurface reservoir temperature. Among different classical geothermometers, only quartz geothermometer provide somewhat reliable estimation (96-140 degrees C) of the reservoir temperature. GeoT modeling results suggest that thermal waters have attained simultaneous equilibrium with respect to minerals like calcite, quartz, chalcedony, brucite, tridymite, cristobalite, talc, at the temperature 130 +/- 5 degrees C which is in good agreement with the result obtained from the mixing model.","[Chatterjee, Sitangshu; Sinha, Uday Kumar; Deodhar, Archana.

The leftover oil residue optimized through Response Surface Model (RSM) using ultrasonic assisted extraction (UAE) with four-factors in Plackett-Burman (PBD) and three-factors in Central composite design (CCD). The model showed good fitness under optimum extraction conditions and total phenolics, flavonoids, tannins, and antioxidant activity were closely fit with the model predicted values. HPLC-PDA analysis detects ten polyphenolic compounds under optimized extraction conditions. The anti-aging activity by tyrosinase and hyaluronidase indicated that extract is good in inhibiting tyrosinase (IC50-1.81 +/- 0.02 mg/mL) and hyaluronidase (IC50-0.90 +/- 0.03 mg/mL) enzyme.

Data were collected through a pre-tested questionnaire from 107 randomly selected households in 18 villages of Uttarakhand. The villages were categorised into 3 classes (core, nearby, faraway) based on proximity to the forests. The contingent-valuation method was used to evaluate WTP [Rs 3,802 (approximate to$57)] and WTA [Rs 38,224 (approximate to$571)] for water as an ecosystem-service and statistical-analyses were performed to evaluate whether factors such as gender, age, household-income and location explained differences in the parameters. It was found that gender had a significant impact on WTP, with women having higher WTP, and that location had significant impact on WTA. The result shows that WTA increased with increasing distance from the sacred-groves (Rs 43,077 +/- 21,139 in faraway-villages and Rs 35,323 +/- 10,483 in corevillages). The results indicated that consideration of gender inequality and education status in villages should be included in planning and decision making about participatory forest management of sacred-groves. These findings facilitate forest-resource-management in mountains and provide guidance for programmes and policies dealing with irrigation, drinking-water and community development.","[Jana, Purna; Todaria, Nagendra P.] HNB Garhwal Univ, Dept Forestry & NR, Chauras Campus, Garhwal 246174, Uttarakhand, India; [Pandey, Rajiv] ICFRE, Biodivers & Climate Change Div, Dehra Dun 248006, Uttarakhand, India; [Semarao, Teodoro; Areteno, Roberta] Univ Salento, Dept Biol & Environm Sci & Technol, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Alatalo, Juha M.] Qatar Univ, Dept Biol & Environm Sci, Coll Arts & Sci, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar; [Tripathi, Ravi] Indian Inst Technol BHU Varanasi, Dept Civil Engn, Banaras Hindu Univ Campus, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Jana, P (corresponding author), HNB Garhwal Univ, Dept Forestry & NR, Chauras Campus, Garhwal 246174, Uttarakhand, India.",purnajana1986@gmail.com,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2021,21.0,8,,,,,4343,4354,,10.2166/ws.2021.181,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2021.181,,JUN 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000660630100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aims to investigate sorption kinetics of As(III & V) and its feedback to arsenic mobilization in the mangrove sediment. It ranges from sand to silty clay loam and shows the adsorption of As(III & V) following the Langmuir relation. Estimates of the maximum adsorption capacity are 59.11 +/- A 13.26 mu g g(-1) for As(III) and 58.45 +/- A 8.75 mu g g(-1) at 30A degrees C for As(V) in the pH range 4 to 8 and salinity 15-30 psu. Extent of adsorption decreases with increasing pH from 4 to 8 and desorption is the rate-limiting step in the reaction of arsenic with sediment. Arsenic in the sediment could be from a Himalayan supply and co-deposited organic matter drives its release from the sediment. Arsenic concentration in the sediment is well below its maximum absorption capacity, suggesting the release of sorbed arsenic in pore water by the microbial oxidation of organic matter in the sediment with less feedback of adsorption.","[Mandal, S.

As revealed by the combined analysis of atmospheric circulation, air-mass three-dimensional back trajectories, and satellite measurements of atmospheric aerosol loading, surface open fire, and tropospheric NOx, the large amount of SLCF/P reaching the NCO-P appeared to be related to natural (mineral dust) and anthropogenic emissions occurring within the PBL of central Pakistan (i.e., Thar Desert), the Northwestern Indo-Gangetic plain, and the Himalayan foothills.

This study examines the distribution and habitat suitability of exotic Grevillea robusta trees in the northwestern Himalayas (state: Uttarakhand), focusing on the interaction between G. robusta and abiotic factors, such as climate, soil, and habitat suitability. This multipurpose agroforestry species is mainly grown by farmers as a boundary tree, windbreak, or shelterbelt and among intercrops on small farms in agroforestry systems worldwide. The results indicate that phenotypic plasticity is determined by tree height and diameter, indicating a higher frequency of young and adult trees. The study also highlights spatio-temporal modeling coupled with geological analysis to address the current distribution pattern and future habitat suitability range through MaxEnt modeling. The AUC ranged from 0.793 +/- 3.6 (RCP 6.0_70) to 0.836 +/- 0.008 (current) with statistical measures, such as K (0.216), NMI (0.240), and TSS (0.686), revealing the high accuracy of the model output. The variables, which include the minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio 6), the slope (Slo), the mean temperature of the driest quarter (Bio 9), and the precipitation of the driest quarter (Bio 17), contribute significantly to the prediction of the distribution of the species in the Himalayan state. The model predicts a significant habitat suitability range for G. robusta based on bio-climatic variables, covering an area of approximately similar to 1641 km(2) with maximal occurrence in Pauri (similar to 321 km(2)) and Almora (similar to 317 km(2)). Notably, the future prediction scenario corroborates with the regions of Tons (Upper Yamuna, Uttarkashi), Kalsi (Mussoorie, Dehradun), the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Badrinath Forest Division for the potentially suitable areas. The climate was found to have a strong influence on the species' distribution, as evidenced by its correlation with the Koppen-Geiger climate classification (KGCC) map. While the species demonstrated adaptability, its occurrence showed a high correlation with bedrocks containing an elevated iron content. Furthermore, the study also provides the first trees outside forests (TOF) map of G. robusta in the region, as well as insight into its future habitat suitability.","[Dabral, Aman; Shankhwar, Rajeev; Kant, Rama; Meena, Rajendra K.; Ginwal, Harish S.; Bhandari, Maneesh S.] ICFRE Forest Res Inst, Div Genet & Tree Improvement, Dehra Dun 248195, India; [Martins-Ferreira, Marco Antonio Cacador] Univ Fed Goias, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Rua Mucuri, BR-74968755 Aparecida De Goiania, Brazil; [Pandey, Shailesh] ICFRE Forest Res Inst, Div Forest Protect, Forest Pathol Discipline, Dehra Dun 248006, India; [Chandra, Girish] Univ Allahabad, Dept Stat, Prayagraj 211002, India; [Thakur, Pawan Kumar] ICFRE Himalayan Forest Res Inst, Forest Ecol & Climate Change Div, Shimla 171013, India; [Sahu, Netrananda] Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Dept Geog, Delhi 110007, India; [Nayak, Sridhara] Japan Meteorol Corp, Res & Dev Ctr, Osaka 5300011, Japan",,"Bhandari, MS (corresponding author), ICFRE Forest Res Inst, Div Genet & Tree Improvement, Dehra Dun 248195, India.;Nayak, S (corresponding author), Japan Meteorol Corp, Res & Dev Ctr, Osaka 5300011, Japan.",amandabral93@gmail.com; 1986sergent@gmail.com; martinsmarco@gmail.com; pandeysh@icfre.org; ramakant@icfre.org; rajendra@icfre.org; dr.girishchandra@allduniv.ac.in; ginwalhs@icfre.org; thakurpawankumar0431@gmail.com; bhandarims@icfre.org; nsahu@geography.du.ac.in; nayak.sridhara@n-kishou.co.jp,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2023,15.0,16,,,,,,,12292,10.3390/su151612292,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su151612292,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001055824500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The concentration of ions in rain water have been observed to follow the pattern Ca(2+) > HCO(3)(-) > Cl(-) > NO(3)(-) > Na(+) > Mg(2+) > SO(4)(2-) > K(+). In order to estimate the marine and non-marine contribution, sea salt fraction has been calculated taking Na(+) as reference. All ionic ratios have been found to be higher than the recommended sea water ratios in all three types of land use, viz. residential, commercial and industrial, suggesting a significant contribution of non-marine origin for these components. A comparison with the data of the other Indian sites validates the inverse relation of Cl(-) and Na(+) with distance from the sea and highlights higher Ca(2+) concentration and lower SO(4)(2-) concentration.

Collected samples of PMs were analyzed for major chemical species as anions (F-, Cl-, SO4 (2-), NO2 (-) and NO3 (-)) and cations (Na+, NH4 (+), K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) by ion chromatography. During the study period, the concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 78.7 +/- 25.1 and 111.8 +/- 23.4 mu g m(-3), respectively. The measured chemical species were found a large variability in different seasons due to the impact of emissions and meteorological parameters. The measured water-soluble (WS) chemical species of PM2.5 and PM10 were 43% (33.7 mu g m(-3)) and 57% (64.2 mu g m(-3)), respectively, with the highest concentrations during the winter season followed by summer, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. A significant positive correlation was observed between NH4 (+) and other species (Cl-, SO4 (2-) and NO3 (-)) in both PM2.5 and PM10, which indicates its presence in the atmosphere as ammonium salts. As a result, NH4 (+) play a crucial role in neutralization of acidic species in the winter season; however, the contrary feature was observed in the summer season where Ca2+ was responsible for the main neutralizing species, mainly transported from the inland region during the summer. Principal component analysis shows that secondary aerosol, biomass burning, and soil-driven dust were the possible sources of the measured species over the station. Further, air mass back trajectory analyses indicate that the highest mass concentrations of PMs and WS chemical species were in the post-monsoon season when the air masses pass from eastern Pakistan and western part of India over receptor site. In the winter season, the concentrations of PMs and WS species were highest (second) when the air masses transported from a long distance up to Southern Afghanistan covering with Pakistan and western part of India. In overall, the study suggests the long-range transport of pollutants plays a crucial role in the enhancement of PMs over Alaknanda valley region.","[Gautam, Alok Sagar] Cent Univ, HNB Garhwal Univ, Dept Phys, Srinagar 246174, Uttarakhand, India; [Negi, Rajendra Singh; Singh, Santosh] Cent Univ, HNB Garhwal Univ, Dept Rural Technol, Srinagar 246174, Uttarakhand, India; [Srivastava, Atul Kumar; Tiwari, Suresh; Bisht, Deewan Singh] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Delhi Branch, Prof Ram Nath Vij Marg, New Delhi 110060, India",,"Bisht, DS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Delhi Branch, Prof Ram Nath Vij Marg, New Delhi 110060, India.",dsbisht@tropmet.res.in,,,,,,,,9.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2018,12.0,5,,,,,681,691,,10.1007/s41742-018-0125-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41742-018-0125-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000443431600012,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present research deals with hydrogeochemical analysis of the eco-sensitive Baraila wetland and possible sources of anthropogenic pollution. The hydrochemical characterization was performed in GIS environment, considering meteorologically induced parameters and spatial variability. Temporal variations were assessed through different seasons, namely pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon with the help of multivariate statistics. The changes in water depth across the seasons showed significant hydrochemical variations in the vertical profile of the wetland apart from thermal demarcation. Seasonal variations in the hydrogeochemistry were induced by multiple physicochemical parameters, geochemical processes, geomorphology of the surrounding area and land use and land cover (LULC) changes. The pre-post flooding changes revealed that aquatic vegetation was increased by 15.36% whereas a major decrease in water bodies (- 73.2%) occurred. Dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature and carbonates are fundamental towards establishing wetland's water chemistry. The water type is primarily of Ca-HCO3 type, mostly derived from rock-water interactions and cation exchange processes. Irrigational quality of water was assessed through multiple indices (sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), %Na, residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MH) and total hardness (TH)) and plots. The heavy aquatic vegetation abundance and eutrophication because of agricultural run-off is currently the major issue with the Baraila wetland and may be playing a simultaneous role in regulating the water chemistry to a large extent apart from other geochemical processes. The hydrogeochemical interactions between sediment and overlying water have created distinct effects on biota and land use/land cover changes. Their role in the landscape is prominent in this respect and may be utilized for environmental management, eco-tourism and employment boost. Serious lack of hydrogeochemical studies in this important floodplain wetland and its rapid deterioration deems it necessary to focus on the comprehensive research and wetland management options for its conservation and sustainable usage in future.","[Aslam, Alvia; Ranjan, Rajesh Kumar] Cent Univ South Bihar, Dept Environm Sci, Gaya 824236, India; [Ahmad, Tauseef] Canakkale Onsekiz Mart Univ, Dept Geol Engn, TR-17100 Canakkale, Turkiye",,"Ranjan, RK (corresponding author), Cent Univ South Bihar, Dept Environm Sci, Gaya 824236, India.",rajeshkranjan@gmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2023,30.0,13,,,,,39223,39245,,10.1007/s11356-022-25005-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-25005-1,,JAN 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000907103500004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In batch sorption experiments, the effects of pH, contact time, initial concentration of metal ions, and sorbent dosage on the adsorption process were trialed. The ideal biosorption conditions for each of the two metals were recorded. The biosorption process was quick, and the equilibrium times for the above-mentioned metals were recorded as 90 and 60 min, with removal percentages of 85% and 83%, respectively. The point zero charge of algal biomass was 4.5, which indicates a negative charge on the surface of the biosorbent. The model-based assessment of the biosorption process was revealed to have followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. The adsorption isotherms for lead and cadmium achieved a best fit with the Langmuir model, with monolayer biosorption capacities of 102 and 128 mg g(-1), respectively. The desorption of both metals achieved more than 70% by using HCl. The FT-IR revealed the presence of hydroxyl and amine groups on the surface of the adsorbent that are involved in the biosorption process, and morphological changes were assessed by SEM.

However information on the outcome of these approaches for conservation is often lacking. In this study, the effectiveness of community-based approaches for conservation of biodiversity was examined in Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) (Nepal) through a combination of ecological assessments and social surveys undertaken both within and outwith ACA. Forest basal area and tree species diversity were found to be significantly higher inside ACA than in neighbouring areas outside. The mean density of cut tree stumps was significantly lower inside ACA, associated with a decline in use of fuelwood as an energy source over the past decade. Social surveys also indicated that wild animal populations have increased inside ACA since the inception of community-based conservation. Observations of animal track counts, pellet counts and direct observations of selected species such as barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak) and Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlethicus) indicated higher abundances within ACA. The community-based management has been successful in delivering conservation benefits in ACA, attributable to changing patterns of resource use and behaviour among local communities, increased control of local communities over their local resources, increased conservation awareness among local people resulting from environmental education, and the development and strengthening of local institutions such as Conservation Area Management Committees (CAMC).

To reduce its potential negative effects, it needs to investigate the susceptibility of glacier debris flow. However, when evaluating the susceptibility of glacier debris flow, most research work considered the impact of existing glacier area, while ignoring the impact of changes in glacier ablation volume. In this paper, we considered the impact of the changes in the glacier ablation volume to investigate the susceptibility of glacier debris flow. We proposed to evaluate the susceptibility analysis in G217 gullies with frequent glacial debris flow on the Duku highway, Xinjiang Province. Specifically, by using the simple band ratio method with the manual correction to identify glacier outlines, we identified the ablation zone by comparing the glacier boundary in 2000 with that in 2015. We then calculated ablation volume by changes in glacier elevation and ablation area from 2000 to 2015. Finally, we used the volume of glacier melting in different watersheds as the main factor to evaluate the susceptibility based on the improved geomorphic information entropy (GIE) method. We found that, overall, the improved GIE method with a correction coefficient based on the glacier ablation volume is better than the previous method.

The present study investigates the commercial collection of lichens, quantifies the traded volume and relates it to a market scenario, and discusses conservation measures in relation to established legal practices in Nepal. Data on lichen trade and revenue generated for the 12 years (2000-2011) were collected and analyzed from 74 districts of Nepal. Voucher specimens were deposited at TUCH (Tribhuvan University Central Herbarium) in Nepal. The lichens collected in West Nepal are mainly used in international trade, while those in East Nepal are used locally for food. A total of 20 commercially important species of lichens were identified from five trade centers and one local market. During 2000-2011, Nepal legally exported 2020 tons of lichens and collected NRs 25,293,305 (USD 240,000). The average annual quantity of turnover was 168 tons, though it is estimated that much was exported illegally. The hill districts in Nepal, which traded 1774 tons, were more important for the collection of commercial lichen species than the Mountainous and inner-Tarai districts, which traded 167 and 108 tons, respectively. Through the Forest Act, Forest Regulations and its amendment in 2011, the collection of lichens for harvest, trade and export in any crude or processed form was banned. However, the legislation lacks an effective implementation strategy, and sustainable harvest of lichen resources based on scientific data would better serve local livelihood and lichen conservation in Nepal.","[Devkota, Shiva; Werth, Silke; Scheidegger, Christoph] Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland; [Chaudhary, Ram Prasad] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Bot, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Chaudhary, Ram Prasad] Tribhuvan Univ, Res Ctr Appl Sci & Technol RECAST, Kirtipur, Nepal; [Werth, Silke] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Plant Sci, Holteigasse 6, A-8010 Graz, Austria",,"Devkota, S (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Res Inst WSL, Zurcherstr 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland.",shiva.devkota@gmail.com,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2017,26.0,10,,,,,2491,2505,,10.1007/s10531-017-1371-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-017-1371-3,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000406637700013,View Full Record in Web of Science

We obtained locations of 781 fires during the 2000-2008 dry seasons, from the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) that delivers global MODIS hotspot/fire locations using remote sensing and GIS technologies. Annual number of fires rose significantly from around 20 at the start of the study period to over 90 after 2002, with most (85%) detected between December and January. Over half of the fires occurred in tall grasslands, but fire density was highest in wetland and riverine vegetation, dry at the time. Most burning took place near rivers, roads and the park boundary, suggesting anthropogenic origins. A kernel density map of all recorded fires indicated three heavily burnt areas in the MNP, all within the tall grasslands.

A total of 55 (2 in pre-monsoon and 53 in monsoon) RW samples were collected during the study period (June-September 2012) and were analyzed for major anions and cations using an ion chromatograph. The pH of precipitation events ranged from 4.95 to 6.50 (average 5.6 +/- 0.3) was observed during the monsoon period (near to the acidic), whereas during the pre-monsoon, the pH was 6.25 +/- 0.49 (alkaline) over the study region; it is due the mixture of anthropogenic as well as the natural chemical constituents. The average ionic concentration (sum of measured chemical constituents) was similar to 3 times higher during the pre-monsoon (986 +/- 101 mu eq/1) compared to that in the monsoon season (373 +/- 37 mu eq/1). This is mainly due to the presence of more natural aerosols in the pre-monsoon season which is also reflected in the pH of rainwater (average 6.25 +/- 0.50) as well as ionic concentration. The chemical composition suggests that Ca2+ was the major contributor (34%) among cations, followed by Na+ (10%), K+ (8%), and Mg2+ (9%), whereas Cl-, NO3-, and SO42- contributed similar to 13, 11, and 9%, respectively, among anions. The average ratio of acidic species (SO42-/NO3-) is 1.56, suggesting 61 and 39% contribution of SO42- and NO3-, respectively, which is very close to the estimated contribution of H2SO4 (60-70%) and HNO3 (30-40%) in the precipitation samples. Neutralization factors for Ca2+, Mg2+, and NH4+ in RW at Nainital are 4.94, 1.21, and 0.37, respectively, indicating their crucial role in neutralization of acidic species. The non-sea-salt (NSS) contribution to total Ca2+, K+, and Mg2+ is estimated to be similar to 98, 97, and 74%, respectively, suggesting the dominance of crustal sources for cations. In contrast, the NSS contribution to the total Cl-and SO42- is 16 and 69% indicating their anthropogenic origin, respectively. Principle component analysis also suggests that the first factor (i.e., natural sources, mainly dust, and sea-salts) accounts for similar to 33% variance, whereas the second factor (i.e., fossil fuel and biomass burning) accounts for similar to 18% variance of the measured ionic composition. The remaining contributions are attributed to the mixed emission sources and transport of pollutants from Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and western parts of India. The results of the present study reveal a significant contribution of crustal and anthropogenic sources in the RW and neutralization processes in the central Himalaya.","[Bisht, Deewan Singh; Srivastava, A.

In order to better cope with the uncertainty of a changing climate, the study of historical drought and its effects on forests could provide useful insights into ecosystem responses to climate variability. Siberian larch (Larix sibirica) is a dominant tree species in Western Mongolia that provides a valuable source of proxy data in the form of annual rings. We used dendrochronological techniques to establish a standard master chronology and analyze the relationship between annual ring widths and climatic factors. Correlation analyses revealed that the strongest associations of tree-ring index (TRI) values for the master chronology to direct climate variables were June temperature (r= -0.36,p< 0.01) and precipitation (r= 0.39,p< 0.01). The master chronology was strongly correlated to Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for June (r= 0.606,p< 0.001), and this variable (PDSIJun) was chosen for reconstruction. A simple linear regression of PDSI(Jun)based on TRI explained 35.4% of the total variance for the period 1965-2016 and based on this model the PDSI(Jun)changes from 1731-2016 were reconstructed. Split-sample calibration-verification tests were conducted to evaluate the quality of the model used for climate reconstruction. In the past 286 years, the number of non-drought years (PDSI > 0) was low, with a frequency of only 14.1% of the total reconstruction years. Extreme drought (PDSIJun< -2.70) occurred frequently in the 19th and early and late 20th centuries. Multi-taper method (MTM) spectra and wavelet analysis showed that the reconstructed PDSI series had high and low frequency periods (2.4-3.3 and 85-92 years).

During a field campaign, fresh snow samples were collected from the surface of the Yala Glacier in May 2017, which were analysed for BC and water-insoluble organic carbon mass concentration in order to estimate the scavenging ratio and surface albedo reduction. The maximum BC mass concentration in the ambient atmosphere (0.73 mu g m(-3)) was recorded in the pre-monsoon season. The BC and water-insoluble organic carbon analysed from the snow samples were in the range of 96-542 ng g(-1) and 152-827 ng g(-1), respectively. The source apportionment study using the absorption Angstrom exponent from in situ observations indicated approximately 44% contribution of BC from biomass-burning sources and the remainder from fossil-fuel sources during the entire study period. The source contribution study, using model data sets, indicated similar to 14% contribution of BC from open-burning and similar to 77% from anthropogenic sources during the study period. Our analysis of regional contributions of BC indicated that the highest contribution was from both Nepal and India combined, followed by China, while the rest was distributed among the nearby countries. The surface snow albedo reduction, estimated by an online model - Snow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiation - was in the range of 0.8-3.8% during the pre-monsoon season.

We assess the policies implemented to enable the transition of the agricultural sector to organic based on how closely they addressed the challenges commonly faced by farmers. The current study identifies the common challenges farmers face while transitioning to organic agri-culture based on literature and maps the corresponding initiatives taken by the Government of Sikkim through a thorough review of policy documents. Findings indicate that while the State focused on certification of farm-lands, farmers suffered yield losses due to disease and pest infestation. Coercive measures were used to convert the State to organic, but limited income support was provided to farmers to hedge them against the risk of crop loss. When integrated well, circular economy and organic agriculture can reinforce each other's goals.

In this context, the present study aimed to assess the levels of indicator bacteria like total Coliform (TC), fecal Coliform (FC) and fecal Streptococcus (FS) in major watersheds of Kashmir valley. Sampling was carried out for a period of 2 years (summer 2017 to spring 2019) along several upstream, midstream and downstream reaches of Jhelum River Basin (JRB), while analysis was carried out by multiple tube fermentation technique involving Most Probable Number (MPN). Major highlights of the results revealed high levels of TC, FC and FS among downstream sites with pronounced seasonal variations between summer and winter. TC was highest at all the reaches and during all the seasons followed by FC and FS. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed more variation in Coliform count among reaches as compared to seasons. Mantle test revealed that environmental factors like observable environmental pressure (OEP) (r: 0.235, p < 0.0001), DO (r: 0.2815, p < 0.0001) and temperature (r: 0.04419, p = 0.0104) had prominent effect on Coliform distribution as compared to geographical factors. The study thus highlights the prevalence of Coliform bacteria along JRB resulting from fecal sources. Due to growing urbanization and lack of adequate sewage treatment facilities, there is an increase in the levels of Coliform bacteria along downstream reaches especially those residing within lower Jhelum and Dara watershed, which could jeopardize water quality and public health.","[Qayoom, Umara; Islam, Sheikh Tajamul; Sabha, Inam; Bhat, Sami Ullah; Dar, Shahid Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Environm Sci, Srinagar 190006, India",,"Bhat, SU (corresponding author), Univ Kashmir, Dept Environm Sci, Srinagar 190006, India.",umaira_2@rediffmail.com; sheikhsidrah345@gmail.com; sabhainam@gmail.com; samiullahbhat11@gmail.com; shahidahmaaddar8@gmail.com,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2023,30.0,3,,,,,7930,7941,,10.1007/s11356-022-22727-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-22727-0,,SEP 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000849304200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

METEOSAT-5 images are classified into three classes: cloudy, partially cloudy, and clear sky. Five features, which measure the temporal and spatial properties of visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) images of METEOSAT-5, are used for this. The proposed classifier finds out a few human understandable rules (fuzzy rules) using exploratory data analysis. A novel attribute of the system is that it analyzes the behavior of misclassifications during training (i.e., typical mistakes) to extract a few more rules which are augmented to the initial rule base to improve its performance. The scheme is tested on images other than the training image(s) and the performance is found to be quite satisfactory. A post-processing scheme is also developed, which utilizes experts' knowledge to generate additional rules to account for coastal region, sunglint areas, and snow-covered Himalayan region. This improves the performance of the system further. Finally, the classification results are compared with multispectral threshold tests, surface synoptic observations, and total cloud cover (tcdc) of reanalysis data produced by National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The high accuracy achieved by the proposed method may be attributed to (1) better design philosophy of classifiers; (2) good choice for the feature vectors; (3) accurate labeling of training data; and (4) exploitation of experts' knowledge.

For this reason, they are used in ecosystem assessment, formulating conservation plans and in raising the environmental awareness. Quantification of different factors affecting diversity of butterflies is important for their effective conservation. In this study, we investigated abiotic and biotic factors affecting species richness and community composition of butterflies along an elevational gradient in Manang region, central Nepal. We also tested if butterfly species follow the Bergmann's rule. A total of 57 butterfly species belonging to 39 genera and 8 families were recorded in the study area. Out of a total of 127 plant species in identified in the study region, only 67 plant species were visited by butterflies as nectar sources. Species richness of butterflies increased with increasing elevation. Species richness was significantly higher in places with shrubs compared to other places and also in autumn than in summer. Species richness of butterflies also depended on composition of plant species occurring at the localities. Butterfly species composition varied among sampling localities. It was also determined by habitat type, elevation, sampling time, plant species and interactions of elevation x time. The relationship between butterfly size and elevation was in the opposite direction than expected according to the Bergmann's rule. In conclusion, protection of butterfly diversity can only be achieved by protecting different habitats across the diverse physiography of the region and different plant species, in particular herbs and shrubs. Our results do not support the Bergmann's rule for butterflies along an elevational gradient in our region.","[Shrestha, Bimal Raj; Gaudel, Prakash; Basnet, Tej B.] Tribhuvan Univ, Cent Dept Zool, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Timsina, Binu; Munzbergova, Zuzana; Dostalek, Tomas] Charles Univ Prague, Dept Inst Environm Studies Bot, Fac Sci, Benatska 2, Prague 12801, Czech Republic; [Timsina, Binu; Rokaya, Maan B.] Czech Acad Sci, Dept Biodivers Res, Global Change Res Ctr, Belidla 4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Munzbergova, Zuzana; Dostalek, Tomas; Rokaya, Maan B.] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic",,"Rokaya, MB (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Dept Biodivers Res, Global Change Res Ctr, Belidla 4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.;Rokaya, MB (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic.",rajsthbimal9@gmail.com; binu.timsina@gmail.com; zuzana.munzbergova@natur.cuni.cz; tomas.dostalek@gmail.com; prakash.gaudel2@gmail.com; tejbasnet@gmail.com; rokayamaan@gmail.com,,,,,,,,7.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2020,17.0,5,,,,,1115,1127,,10.1007/s11629-019-5381-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-019-5381-3,,MAR 2020,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000520703600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this qualitative study on the forest ecosystem services in Bhutan, we assessed community awareness and perceptions of local forest ecosystem services, identified their top priorities, and evaluated how they have changed over time. The study focused on state reserve forest areas designated for commercial timber production, formally known as forest management units (FMU). We held focus group discussions separately with women and men associated with five FMUs in the central belt of the country. Participants identified 45 ecosystem services, with soil productivity, freshwater, timber, fresh air, construction stone, carbon sequestration, spiritual value, pollination, and local weather regulation comprising the most highly valued services critical to local livelihood and well-being. Participants felt that forest ecosystem services have been generally declining over the past decade in the FMUs and identified a need for forest restoration activities to improve their delivery. We recommend that state forest entities conduct an awareness campaign to empower communities with the conceptual framework and globally recognized concepts to advocate for their needs related to forests. We also recommend that biophysical and economic studies be conducted in these areas to seek evidence for causal linkages between natural resource use and the status of ecosystem services.

The effect of different snowpack conditions on the SD and SWE inversion accuracy was demonstrated by using three TerraSAR-X acquisitions. The algorithm is based on the relationship between the SD, the co-polar phase difference (CPD), and particle anisotropy. The Dhundi observatory in the Indian Himalaya was selected as a validation test site where a field campaign was conducted for ground truth measurements in January 2016. Using the field measured values of the snow parameters, the particle anisotropy has been optimized and provided as an input to the SD retrieval algorithm. A spatially variable snow density (rho s) was used for the estimation of the SWE, and a temporal resolution of 90 m was achieved in the inversion process. When the retrieval accuracy was tested for different snowpack conditions, it was found that the proposed algorithm shows good accuracy for recrystallized dry snowpack without distinct layering and low wetness (w). The statistical indices, namely, the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute difference (MAD), and percentage error (PE), were used for the accuracy assessment. The algorithm was able to retrieve SD with an average MAE and RMSE of 6.83 cm and 7.88 cm, respectively. The average MAE and RMSE values for SWE were 17.32 mm and 21.41 mm, respectively. The best case PE in the SD and the SWE retrieval were 8.22 cm and 18.85 mm, respectively.","[Patil, Akshay; Singh, Gulab] Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Patil, Akshay] IITB Monash Res Acad, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Ruediger, Christoph] Monash Univ, Dept Civil Engn, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia",,"Patil, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Ctr Studies Resources Engn, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.;Patil, A (corresponding author), IITB Monash Res Acad, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, India.",akshay.patil@monash.edu; gulab.singh@iitb.ac.in; Rudiger@monash.edu,,,,,,,,12.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2020,12.0,7,,,,,,,1183,10.3390/rs12071183,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12071183,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000537709600133,View Full Record in Web of Science

Because of the high altitude and remote location, the Karakoram Range is difficult to access and, therefore, remains scarcely monitored. In situ precipitation and temperature measurements are only available at valley locations. High-altitude observations exist only for very limited periods. Gridded precipitation and temperature data generated from the spatial interpolation of in situ observations are unreliable for this region because of the extreme topography. Besides satellite measurements, which offer spatial coverage, but underestimate precipitation in this area, atmospheric reanalyses remain one of the few alternatives. Here, we apply a proven approach to quantify the uncertainty associated with an ensemble of monthly precipitation and temperature reanalysis data for 1979-2009 in Shigar Basin, Central Karakoram. A Model-Conditional Processor (MCP) of uncertainty is calibrated on precipitation and temperature in situ data measured in the proximity of the study region. An ensemble of independent reanalyses is processed to determine the predictive uncertainty of monthly observations. As to be expected, the informative gain achieved by post-processing temperature reanalyses is considerable, whereas significantly less gain is achieved for precipitation post-processing. The proposed approach indicates a systematic assessment procedure for predictive uncertainty through probabilistic weighting of multiple re-forecasts, which are bias-corrected on ground observations. The approach also supports an educated reconstruction of gap-filling for missing in situ observations.","[Reggiani, Paolo] Univ Siegen, Dept Civil Engn, D-57068 Siegen, Germany; [Coccia, Gabriele] Univ Bologna, Dept Biol Geol & Environm Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Mukhopadhyay, Biswajit] DHI India Water & Environm, New Delhi 110020, India",,"Reggiani, P (corresponding author), Univ Siegen, Dept Civil Engn, D-57068 Siegen, Germany.",paolo.reggiani@uni-siegen.de; gabriele.coccia@gmail.com; bim@dhigroup.com,,,,,,,,19.0,22.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2016,8.0,6,,,,,,,263,10.3390/w8060263,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w8060263,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000378851300047,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Moktan, MR",,,,"Moktan, Mani Ram",,,Social and Ecological Consequences of Commercial Harvesting of Oak for Firewood in Bhutan,MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Oak (Quercus spp.) is an important commercially harvested firewood resource in Bhutan. An oak firewood shortage began in 2000-2009, when demand, spurred by urban domestic and institutional use, began to exceed supply, resulting in overcutting of oak-dominant forest, which affected tree species diversity. This study solicited urban and rural perceptions on oak firewood availability, alternative firewood sources, and whether harvest is consistent with oak conservation, and conducted an assessment of the consequences of commercial oak firewood harvest for species diversity and regeneration. Semistructured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted, and regeneration was sampled on unharvested and commercially harvested oak firewood stands. Urban and rural respondents reported that the oak firewood supply was diminishing. Rural respondents said that oak firewood, leaf litter, fodder, and wood for handles for agricultural implements were abundantly available in the past but that, with the increase in population, these products have become less available, a trend that is likely to continue in the future. Urban respondents overwhelmingly chose electricity as an oak firewood substitute because it was associated with clean energy, improved sanitation, and forest conservation. Electricity should be promoted as an oak firewood substitute in urban homes. Oak as a source of firewood, leaf litter, fodder, and handles for agricultural implements is indispensable for sustaining rural livelihoods, and harvest consistent with conservation needs to be practiced. Tree species diversity and regeneration were not significantly higher in unharvested stands compared to harvested stands, indicating that oak firewood harvest may not have impacted species diversity. The findings support banning commercial harvesting of green oak trees for firewood and promoting electricity as an alternative energy source as the most important oak conservation measures.","Council Renewable Nat Resources Res Bhutan, Thimphu, Bhutan",,"Moktan, MR (corresponding author), Council Renewable Nat Resources Res Bhutan, Thimphu, Bhutan.",manirammoktan@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,4.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2014,34.0,2,,,,,139,146,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-12-00113.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-12-00113.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000338441800007,View Full Record in Web of Science

We assess these generalizations in an evaluation of protected areas in India. The 5% of India officially protected covers most ecoregions and protected areas have been an important reason why India has suffered no documented species extinctions in the past 70 years. India has strong legislation favouring conservation, government investment focused on 50 Tiger Reserves, and government compensation schemes that facilitate local support, all of which brighten future prospects. However, many protected areas are too small to maintain a full complement of species, making connectivity and species use of buffer zones a crucial issue. Conservation success and challenges vary across regions according to their development status. In less developed areas, notably the biodiverse northeast Himalaya, protected areas maintaining the highest biodiversity result from locally-focused efforts by dedicated individuals. Across India, we demonstrate considerable opportunities to increase local income through ecotourism. Our evaluation confirms a lack of data, increasing threats, and the importance of local support. Research on biodiversity in buffer zones, development of long-term monitoring schemes, and assessment of cash and conservation benefits from tourism are in particular need. For policy makers, two main goals should be the development of monitoring plans for 'eco-sensitive zones' around protected areas, and a strong emphasis on preserving established protected areas.","[Ghosh-Harihar, Mousumi; Ramakrishnan, Uma; Thatte, Prachi] Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Natl Ctr Biol Sci, Bellary Rd, Bengaluru 560065, Karnataka, India; [An, Ruby; Wacker, Kristen; Price, Trevor D.] Univ Chicago, Dept Ecol & Evolut, 940 E 57Th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Athrey, Ramana] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res, Homi Bhabha Rd, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India; [Borthakur, Udayan; Chetry, Dilip] Aaranyak, 13 Tayab Ali Byelane, Gauhati 781028, Assam, India; [Chanchani, Pranav] WWF India, 172 B Lodhi Estate, New Delhi 110003, India; [Datta, Aparajita; Harihar, Abishek] Nat Conservat Fdn, 1311 Amritha,12th Main,Vijaynagar 1st Stage, Mysore 570017, Karnataka, India; [Harihar, Abishek] Panthera, 8 West 40th St,18th Floor, New York, NY 10018 USA; [Karanth, Krithi K.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, 2300 Bronx Blvd, New York, NY USA; [Karanth, Krithi K.; Mariyam, Dincy] Ctr Wildlife Studies, 551,7th Main Rd Rajiv Gandhi Nagar,2nd Phase, Kodigehalli 560097, Bengaluru, India; [Mohan, Dhananjai] 103,Phase 2, Dehra Dun 248006, India; [Onial, Malvika; Mathur, Vinod B.] Midge Inst India, POB 18, Dehra Dun 248001, India; [Robin, V.

J,"Rawat, A; Joshi, GK",,,,"Rawat, Ankita; Joshi, Gopal K.",,,Physicochemical and microbiological assessment of spring water in central Himalayan region,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"In the present study, water quality of 16 springs, located along National Highway-58 from Rishikesh to Badrinath in India, was assessed by determining various physicochemical and microbiological parameters in three different seasons, i.e., pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon. For majority of the springs, the pH was slightly alkaline with temperature ranging between 10 and 27 degrees C. All other parameters such as total hardness (TH), total alkalinity (TA), chloride, phosphate, nitrate, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were found to lie within the acceptable limit prescribed by various standard national and international agencies. The principal component analysis reveals that water quality of springs mainly depends on mineral contents of water, as there is a loading of TH, TA, EC, TDS, and other mineral components during one or other season of a year. The positive correlation coefficients determined among mineral components of spring water further substantiate this fact. No loading of DO, BOD, nitrate, and phosphate indicates an absence of anthropogenic pollution in the studied area. No trace metals were detected in any of the springs. Most probable number (MPN) index for coliforms was found to be above the acceptable limit for all the springs in one or more seasons of a year, except the one in Pandukeshwar. Plate-based assay revealed the presence of pathogens like Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, and Pseudomonas in some spring water. The findings of the present work reveal that due to high MPN index and presence of other pathogenic bacteria, water from most of the springs cannot be considered completely safe for direct human consumption in its raw form.","[Rawat, Ankita; Joshi, Gopal K.] HNB Garhwal Univ, Dept Zool & Biotechnol, Srinagar 246174, Uttarakhand, India",,"Joshi, GK (corresponding author), HNB Garhwal Univ, Dept Zool & Biotechnol, Srinagar 246174, Uttarakhand, India.",gkjoshi@rediffmail.com,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2019,191.0,4,,,,,,,218,10.1007/s10661-019-7369-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-019-7369-4,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000461375300004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we present the characteristics of multi-layer distribution and effects of Black Carbon (BC) and inorganic ions in the snowpacks of Khardung (KG) and Phuche (PG) glaciers (> 5 km a.s.l.) in the western Himalayas. We observed significant vertical heterogeneity of BC in the snowpacks of KG (-42-428 ng g-1) and PG (-59 and 299 ng g-1), with higher concentrations in aged snow. Similar to BC, ions in the multi-layer snowpack also depicted prominent vertical heterogeneity with strong crustal influence (as indicated by abundant nssCa2+) in the aged snow layers of KG, which also possess a higher snow-melt rate as compared to PG. Among the other inorganic ions, the vertical profiles of nssSO42- and NO3- indicated elution and refreezing effects. The computation of the effective snow albedo for different snow-darkening and snow-physical processes vindicated the need of considering the multilayer model for the accurate quantification of effects of heterogeneous distributions of light absorbing aerosols (LAA) in the snowpacks. Following this, the multi-layer simulations of snow-albedo in the SNICAR model demonstrated the change in snow albedo by 2.5-9.0% for the amount of LAA observed in our study. This resulted in snow albedo forcing of 49.2 Wm-2 for PG, 30.8 Wm-2 for KG1 and 29.6 Wm-2 for KG2 for the typical snow-physical properties in the study region. Comprehensive data sets comprising physical, morphological and chemical properties of aerosols and snow are imperative to predict aerosol-induced snow darkening and the associated anomalous melting of snow/glacier over the Himalayan region.","[Thakur, Roseline C.] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, Helsinki 00014, Finland; [Arun, B.

The magnitude of suspended sediments has important implications for channel morphology, material flux, geochemical cycling, and water quality of the river. This study investigates the dynamics of suspended sediment and its mineralogical and chemical characteristics with meltwater draining from Gangotri Glacier during the ablation season of 2012 in relation to hydrology and geology of the basin. Significant variations in suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and Suspended sediment load (SSL) were observed. The results indicate that there may be a major source (or a few similar sources) of suspended sediment contributing to river discharge over the study site. The concentration of contributing sediment is either diluted by mixing with relatively clean snowmelt water or concentrated by stormwater after interaction with lithology. The major possible source(s) of suspended sediment lies beneath the glacier. In addition, significant variations in relative mineralogy (fine fraction of chlorite, quartz, K-feldspar, and plagioclase) and chemical analyses of alkali and heavy metal (K, Na, Fe, As, Mn, Cu) in the sediment suggest a significant role of subglacial meltwater in controlling the chemical composition of suspended sediment during the ablation season. Snow and glacier melt are the main factors controlling river discharge near the snout of Gangotri glacier. Further, the variability of snow and glacier meltwater due to temperature variation controls the dynamics of suspended sediment concentration.","[Joshi, Rajesh] GB Pant Natl Inst Himalayan Environm, Sikkim Reg Ctr, Gangtok 737101, Sikkim, India; [Khan, Abul Amir] Amity Univ Haryana, Amity Ctr Air Pollut Control ACAPC, Gurugram 122413, Haryana, India; [Khan, Abul Amir] Amity Univ Haryana, Amity Ctr Ocean Atmospher Sci & Technol ACOAST, Gurugram 122413, Haryana, India; [Pant, N.

The Jhelum River is one such transnational mountain river flowing through India and Pakistan. The basin is minimally glacierized and its discharge is largely governed by seasonal snow cover and snowmelt. Therefore, accurate estimation of seasonal snow cover dynamics and snowmelt-induced runoff is important for sustainable water resource management in the region. The present study looks into spatio-temporal variations of snow cover for past decade and stream flow simulation in the Jhelum River basin. Snow cover extent (SCE) was estimated using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) sensor imageries. Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) algorithm was used to generate multi-temporal time series snow cover maps. The results indicate large variation in snow cover distribution pattern and decreasing trend in different sub-basins of the Jhelum River. The relationship between SCE-temperature, SCE-discharge and discharge-precipitation was analyzed for different seasons and shows strong correlation. For streamflow simulation of the entire Jhelum basin Snow melt Runoff Model (SRM) used. A good correlation was observed between simulated stream flow and in-situ discharge. The monthly discharge contribution from different sub-basins to the total discharge of the Jhelum River was estimated using a modified version of runoff model based on temperature-index approach developed for small watersheds. Stream power - an indicator of the erosive capability of streams was also calculated for different sub-basins.","[Sharma, Vaibhav; Mishra, V.

Additional Plateau-scale verification is performed with monthly LST products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Noah land surface model and air temperature measured by Chinese Meteorological Administration. Trend analysis shows that the annual and monthly standardized anomalies are increasing at an averaged rate of 0.5 decade (-aEuro parts per thousand 1). The highest positive trends are noted over the central part of the Plateau, which is on average 0.80 decade (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) with a maximum of 1.44 decade (-aEuro parts per thousand 1). Conversely, a negative trend in the anomalies is found for the Taklamakan desert and the Himalayan foothills with a rate of -0.27 decade (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) and reaching a maximum of -1.4 decade (-aEuro parts per thousand 1). In addition, we find that LST anomaly trends on the Plateau are seasonally dependent and increase with the elevation. These observed trends are in agreement with previous studies conducted with in-situ measurements, which demonstrates the use of long-term earth observation programmes for climate studies as has also been articulated in the 2007 IPCC report.","[Salama, Mhd Suhyb; Van der Velde, Rogier; Ofwono, Matthew; Su, Zhongbo] Univ Twente, ITC, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands; [Zhong, Lei; Ma, Yaoming] Chinese Acad Sci ITP CAS, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Salama, MS (corresponding author), Univ Twente, ITC, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",salama@itc.nl,,,,,,,,55.0,59.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2012,114.0,3-4,,,,,769,781,,10.1007/s10584-012-0427-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0427-3,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000308246300019,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the heart of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, Dal Lake, has witnessed extreme loss in water quality during the last four decades because of anthropogenic pressures. The lake is unique in that over 50,000 people inhabit the lake itself in houseboats, dongas, or islands within the lake. These people derive their livelihood from the lake in terms of tourism, agriculture, fishing, and vegetable farming. The countless ways people use the lake have led to an extreme load of pollution in the lake. Encroachment in and around the lake has led to the loss of volume of water in the lake and consequently increased the concentration of pollutants. Discharge of untreated sewage, agricultural runoff, and sediments from adjoining catchments have further degraded the lake water quality. The changes in water quality are clear from the physio-chemical properties of the lake waters. While transparency and dissolved oxygen in the lake have decreased drastically during the last 40 years, the concentration of harmful substances like phosphates, nitrates, and chlorides has increased. The hardness of water has also increased due to higher levels of carbonates and bicarbonates in the lake. This paper details the changes in the water quality of Dal Lake over the recent past.

The MPs were detected in all water and sediment samples with abundances ranging from 02-64 particles/L and 15-632 particles/kg dw, respectively. The abundance of MPs, dominated by polyethylene and polystyrene, with the majority being fibres and fragments indicated that they were derived from plastic paints, boats or synthetic products. The concentrations of PAEs in the surface sediment samples varied from 06-357 ng/g dw. The most abundant PAEs in the sediments were dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), since they were present in all the samples collected from the lake basin. The relatively higher abundances of MPs and higher concentrations of PAEs were generally found in the vicinity of areas impacted by anthropogenic activities.

However, these groundwater reserves form a substantial part of a rapidly weathering alluvial drainage resulting in major contamination by Arsenic (As) and associated heavy metals thereby raising key concern on their safety and sustained usage. The current study entails a comprehensive qualitative analysis of the potable groundwater reserves using a combination of geographical information system (GIS) and geochemical approaches to determine the severity of groundwater contamination by As and other heavy metals in a total of twenty administrative districts of Assam, India. Furthermore, the groundwater solute chemistry and water quality status in the 20 districts of the study area, which encompasses the Brahmaputra River valley, was also assessed to evaluate the sustainability of these potable groundwater reserves. The findings show that the groundwater aquifers present in these districts of the Brahmaputra River valley in Assam are severely contaminated with As with the highest concentration at similar to 352.56 ppb being observed in the district of Nagaon. The districts of Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Golaghat, Sonitpur, Nagaon, Morigaon, Darrang, Udalguri, Kamrup, Nalbari, and Baksa also showed the presence of elevated levels of dissolved As which on an average exceeded the WHO permissible limit of 10 parts per billion as well as the Bureau of Indian Standards limit of 50 parts per billion. Moreover, notable contamination by other heavy metals including lead, manganese, iron, and zinc exceeding the WHO and BIS prescribed limits were prominent. Also, the groundwater was found to harbour elevated concentrations of ions such as HCO3-, Ca-2(+) and Mg2+ which impart severe restrictions on to the safety, aesthetics and palatability of these potable water reserves. Furthermore, the dissolved As content was found to exhibit a significant correlation to the elemental contaminants such as iron and manganese suggesting that the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides may serve as the underlying mechanism for the As enrichment of these groundwater reserves. Additionally, the impact assessment study through the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality index (GWQI) of the areas studied showed that the groundwater reserves in the majority of the administrative districts are unfit for human consumption, without the intervention through requisite water treatment and/or sustainable remediation approaches.

The GRACE mission data (level 3, release 5, i.e. RL05, time span January 2003 to December 2014) from the three agencies, i.e. CSR, GFZ and JPL, are used to analyse the TWS dynamics for the Indo-Gangetic plain which is one of the most water-stressed regions in the world. The dynamics of TWS is expected to have periodic behaviour due to the seasonal pattern. Because of the vast study area, significant seasonal pattern changes are prevalent in the region. Hence, the entire study area was classified on the basis of seasonal behaviour. For the classification of the study area, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to get the dominant frequency which represents the seasonality. The intensity of most dominant frequency varies spatially from a grid to grid and it actually increases from the upper Indo-Gangetic plain to the lower Indo-Gangetic plain. This intensity variation was used to classify the study area. Further, trend analysis and time series models were established for each classified region. The trend analysis shows that the TWS is depleting at the rate of (3.91 +/- 0.23) cm/month for the region near the Himalayan foot plain, Delhi and Haryana. For the other classified regions, the rate of depletion is (2.75 +/- 0.55) cm/month and(2.58 +/- 0.56)cm/month.

Here, we analyze tropospheric ozone (O-3), formaldehyde (HCHO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) to assess other measures of air quality across South Asia from 2008 to 2018. The IASI-Forli retrieved tropospheric ozone data was validated with ozonesonde, reanalysis (ERA5), satellite (TES), and model simulation products (GEOS-Chem and TOMCAT/SLIMCAT). Space-based observations of these three trace gases were used to conduct a spatio temporal analysis over South Asia using trend analysis (Theil-Sen and linear regression), change-point detection (Pettitt's test), and hotspot identification (Getis-Ord G(i)*). We used the formaldehyde-nitrogen dioxide ratio (FNR) to identify NOx limited, VOC limited, and transitional regimes in South Asia. Counter to previous studies, a statistically significant decrease of HCHO (-0.0041 DU yr(-1)) and O-3 (-0.064 DU yr(-1)) was detected for South Asia; however, NO2 is increasing the 0.001 DU yr(-1) over South Asia during 2008-18. The Indo-Gangetic Plains emerged as being critically affected by the three trace gases. Certain parts of southern and south-eastern India are gradually emerging as NO2 and HCHO hotpots.

The precision of a morphometric analysis depends on the high-resolution digital elevation models and a powerful estimation tool. The purpose of the study is to calculate the geomorphic indices such as Stream length gradient Index & SL-Hot Spot, Topographic swath profile, Transverse topographic symmetry factor, Channel Steepness Index, Hypsometry, and Erosion-Uplift Rate. The comparative analysis was done for the 3 sub-catchments of the Alaknanda Basin namely Upper Alaknanda, Dhauli and Middle Alaknanda. The results obtain from each of the catchment shows the spatial distribution of hot and cold spot that helps to select the zone with high SL anomalous values and principal knickzones. This information is associated with major thrusts such as the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS), Main Central Thrust (MCT), Vaikrita Thrust (VT) of Munsiari group, Alaknanda Fault (AF) and other minor faults with the proof of landscape signature. Various knickpoints were found along the trunk stream and have been precisely analyzed using the SL-HCA approach, validated through aerial imagery and, finally, through the detailed field observations. The study also found that convexity in the river profile and knickpoints around Karnaprayag, Nandaprayag, and Joshimath, the uplift rate exceeds the rate of incision. Further, the findings show that these outputs are used in geomorphological investigations like tectonic activity, rock differential erosion, and hillslope formation.","[Negi, Priyanka; Goswami, Ajanta] IIT Roorkee, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India; [Joshi, Girish Chandra] Govt Uttarakhand, Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Author, Dehra Dun, India",,"Goswami, A (corresponding author), IIT Roorkee, Dept Earth Sci, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India.",ajantagoswami@gmail.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2023,82.0,20,,,,,,,468,10.1007/s12665-023-11158-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-023-11158-w,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001067019900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to investigate the geochemical features of the YT, 18 surface sediment samples were collected; ten trace element concentrations were measured for bulk sediments and two fine grain size fractions. Meanwhile, basic physicochemical parameters and element concentrations of river water were also analyzed. Results indicated that the river water was alkaline (pH 8.42) and that dissolved oxygen was mainly controlled by river water temperature. Some elements (e.g., Zn and Ni) showed close negative relationship to mean grain size of the sediments. Concentrations of most heavy metals, except As of the YT bulk sediments, were similar to those of Upper Crustal Concentration and its lower reaches, indicating almost no anthropogenic impact. Arsenic of the YT sediments was derived fundamentally from the parent rocks of the YT Basin and was far higher than that of its lower reaches. This indicates that relatively small amounts of As from the study area were transported down to the Brahmaputra River under present, relatively dry climatic conditions. However, more YT sediments might have been transported to its low reaches during the Holocene due to the wet climate, giving high As concentration in Holocene sediments of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin. Thus, As transported by the YT may produce important influence on the Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin and contribute to its high As concentration in groundwater.","[Li, Chaoliu; Kang, Shichang; Zhang, Qianggong; Gao, Shaopeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Kang, Shichang] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Sharma, Chhatra Mani] Kathmandu Univ, Aquat Ecol Ctr, Kathmandu, Nepal",,"Kang, SC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",shichang.kang@itpcas.ac.cn,,,,,,,,31.0,34.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2011,33.0,1,,,,,23,32,,10.1007/s10653-010-9311-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-010-9311-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000287510200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our observations indicate that the SPM in general showed higher levels of total mercury compared to the surface sediments while at places the enhancement could be by a factor of 10, say around 25 mug g(-1) in the downstream region that integrates the industrial midstream and agricultural downstream terrain near its confluence with the Ganges. Surface sediments in the upstream direction near the Himalayan foothills and SPM in the lower reaches showed significant high Index of Geoaccumulation (I-geo) as defined by Muller.(1) Size fractionation studies indicate that the finer fraction preferentially showed higher levels of mercury while in the lower reaches of the river, the total mercury is equitably distributed among all size fractions. The proportion of the residual fraction of mercury in relation to mobile fractions, in general decreases downstream towards its confluence with the Ganges river. In sediment cores, the vertical distribution show systematic peaks of mercury indicating that addition of this toxic metal to the aquatic system is in direct proportion to the increase in various types of human activities such as thermal power plants, land use changes ( urbanisation) in the midstream region and intensive fertiliser application in lower reaches of this vast river basin.","Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India; Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci Hydrol, Uppsala, Sweden",,"Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Sch Environm Sci, New Delhi 110067, India.",subrama42@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,10.0,11.0,,,,,,,,,,,,2003,5.0,3,,,,,427,434,,10.1039/b211263a,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b211263a,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000183091600013,View Full Record in Web of Science

AOD derived from MODIS Terra observations shows large spatial inhomogeneity and characteristic variability with distinct temporal distributions. The pre-monsoon (spring) seasons (March-April-May; MAM) is characterized by high aerosol concentration over north-west part of India along with IGP region.

The ion contents of liquids identify two distinguished types of water, namely the Na-SO4-Cl type primarily from geothermal water and the Na-SO4-HCO3 and Na-Ca-CO3-SO4 types primarily from cold water. The compositions of the hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of the samples indicate geothermal waters were recharged by atmospheric precipitation and 3000-4600 m high snow mountain meltwater, which may have experienced circulation of 16,300-17,300 years and mixtures of submodern and recent recharge water sources evidenced by isotopes of H-3, C-13, and C-14 data.

Lumbini is a sacred place as the birthplace of Lord Buddha, and thus a UNESCO world heritage site, located near the northern edge of the central Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and before the Himalayan foothills (and Himalayas) to its north. Average aerosol optical depth (AOD) is found to be 0.64 +/- 0.38 (0.06-3.28) over the sampling period (January 2013-December 2014), with the highest seasonal AOD during the post-monsoon season (0.72 +/- 0.44). More than 80% of the daily averaged AOD values, during the monitoring period, are above 0.3, indicating polluted conditions in the region. The levels of aerosol load observed over Lumbini are comparable to those observed at several heavily polluted sites in the IGP. Based on the relationship between AOD and ngstrom exponent (alpha), anthropogenic, biomass burning, and mixed aerosols are found to be the most prevalent aerosol types.

Sediment samples were collected from two sites in the Indian Ocean during January-February 2010 using gravity corer. Phosphorus fractions in sediments were analyzed by a modified sequential extraction procedure (SEDEX). The vertical profile revealed silt and clay as dominant grain size fractions in both cores. The enriched levels of organic carbon were observed in samples due to adsorption on fine grained sediments. Loosely bound P was the most dominant fraction, and its higher concentration in sediments was due to increased productivity and subsequent inputs of biogenic components. Detritus from marine organisms and lower oxygen concentrations (depleted E-h values) enhanced the production of authigenic P. The lower iron bound P fraction at specific depths was attributed to the nature of Fe minerals present within sediments. Decreased level of organic phosphate fraction was due to mineralization. The presence of Detrital P, the diagenetically stable form of P, might be due to inputs from the Himalayan, peninsular Indian, and Sri Lankan regions. The biogenic form was the dominant phosphate fraction throughout the cores suggesting the dissolution of fish debris. Estimated bioavailable phosphorous (BAP) ranged from 82.2 to 98.7% in Core I and from 90.21 to 92.98% in Core II, suggesting the fact that a major portion of the phosphate was bioavailable and hence the alterations in environmental conditions can release the BAP to water column resulting in nutrient enrichment.

To reveal the geochemical heterogeneity over the multi-spatial and temporal scale, controlling factors (natural and anthropogenic), and source end-members, dissolved load samples were collected during the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon season of the year 2014. Major cations and anions data were analyzed using principal component analysis and mass-balancing equations-based forward modeling to quantify the contribution from the atmosphere, rock weathering, and anthropogenic sources. The results show that chemical weathering predominates the dilution effect during the pre- and post-monsoon season. A high level of pollution prevails during the non-monsoon season and particularly in floodplain tributaries. Anthropogenic sources contribute up to 42% of the dissolved load composition, whereas silicate and carbonate weathering predominantly contributes 93 and 82% of the dissolved load. Further, the silicate weathering rate (4.9 t km(-2) y(-1)) is higher than the carbonate weathering rate and efficiently uptakes an average of 3.5 x 10(5) mol km(-2) y(-1) of CO2.

Some other practices have been done for springs' revival and their improvement in discharge rate, by the government and local communities like construction of percolation pits, contour trenches, check dams, and improvement of water resources which are also tried to touch those areas. It has been observed among the analyzed sample that the Kumaon region is dominated by arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead, whereas aluminum, barium, cobalt, and manganese are more in the Garhwal region. Apart from spring, this review paper also reveals the physicochemical characteristics of the spring-fed river and lakes of the Kumaon region.","[Chhimwal, Monika; Srivastava, Rajeev Kumar] GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol Pantnagar, CBSH, Dept Environm Sci, Pantnagar 263145, Uttarakhand, India; [Kaur, Simran; Prasad, Halkurike Jayadevaish Shiva] GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol Pantnagar, Dept Civil Engn, COT, Pantnagar 263145, Uttarakhand, India; [Hagare, Dharma] Western Sydney Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Sustainable Engn, Penrith, NSW, Australia",,"Chhimwal, M (corresponding author), GB Pant Univ Agr & Technol Pantnagar, CBSH, Dept Environm Sci, Pantnagar 263145, Uttarakhand, India.",monikachhimwal292@gmail.com,,,,,,,,5.0,6.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2022,20.0,4,,,,,737,754,,10.2166/wh.2022.028,http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wh.2022.028,,APR 2022,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000778622100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Zhaxikang geothermal field, located in the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau, is a typical high-temperature geothermal field related to the orogenic rift system. The hydrochemical type of the hot springs is predominantly HCO3-Cl-Na. In this study, the primary hydrochemical processes, including mixing and degassing, were identified and qualified based on hydrogeochemical and isotopic data. The results indicate that the deep geothermal fluid consists of meteoric water (80%) mixed with magmatic water (20%). Mixing with magmatic water and weak water-rock interactions might be responsible for the inapparent oxygen isotope shift. Comprehensive analyses of the Na-K and quartz geothermometers, the Na-K-Ca ternary diagram, as well as the enthalpy-silica and enthalpy-chloride mixing model yield reliable temperature estimates ranging from 180 to 210 degrees C. The equilibrium temperature of the multi-minerals converges at a narrow range from 185 to 205 degrees C, which was determined using geothermometrical modeling after correcting for the dilution and degassing processes. Different degrees of CO2 degassing (0.1-0.7 mol/L) were identified during the upward migration of the geothermal fluid through geothermometrical modeling. The SiO2 concentration (292 mg/L) and chloride concentration (490 mg/L) of the deep geothermal fluid under the Zhaxikang geothermal field were estimated through a comprehensive analysis of the enthalpy-silica and enthalpy-chloride diagrams, respectively.","[Wang, Yingchun; Zuo, Yinhui; Song, Rongcai] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Energy Resources, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Gu, Hongyu; Li, Dan] China Geol Survey, Chengdu Ctr, Chengdu 610081, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yingchun] Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Lyu, Min] China Nucl Power Engn Co Ltd, Beijing 100840, Peoples R China; [Lu, Lianghua] Nanjing Hydraul Res Inst, State Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Hydraul En, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",,"Wang, YC (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Energy Resources, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.;Gu, HY (corresponding author), China Geol Survey, Chengdu Ctr, Chengdu 610081, Peoples R China.;Wang, YC (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, State Key Lab Oil & Gas Reservoir Geol & Exploita, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",wangyingchun19@cdut.edu.cn; xy0909040129@126.com,,,,,,,,14.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2021,80.0,11,,,,,,,415,10.1007/s12665-021-09577-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09577-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000692137000002,View Full Record in Web of Science

To study the same, the two significant meteorological parameters such as temperature and precipitation have been down-scaled at various locations over the Eastern Himalayas. For the downscaling, the latest Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 climate models with Representative Concentration Pathways experiments were utilized. In this article, we have basically emphasized on the temperature extremity in the historical/measured (1979-2005) and twenty-first century projected (2006-2100) time series durations. The precipitation extreme indices have been computed to correlate the effect of temperature extremes. The results showed that there were substantial variations in these two factors, in terms of their rates, intensities and frequencies in intra-decadal (1979-2005, 2006-2030, 2041-2065 and 2076-2100) time durations. A multi-model climatic projection showed a significant increment in the average annual temperature rate across all the climate stations. Analysis results showed that over the period of records: (1) a diurnal variation of temperature is decreasing due to increments in the minimum temperature, especially after the 2030s; (2) extreme indices-based results showed that the frequencies increase for the summer days and tropical nights but decrease for the frost days. Likewise the intensities of warmest nights also increase; (3) a significant geographical heterogeneity was observed in the temperature as per the results from the multi-model projected temperature datasets; and (4) indeed, there were noticeable areas where these datasets differed on both the sign and significance of precipitation and temperature trends.","[Singh, Vishal; Goyal, Manish Kumar] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India",,"Goyal, MK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India.",vipmkgoyal@gmail.com,,,,,,,,21.0,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY,2016,75.0,9,,,,,,,839,10.1007/s12665-016-5651-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5651-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000376030100115,View Full Record in Web of Science

Shrubs are long-neglected life form in the forest ecosystem, playing many roles in the forest and human life. Shrub has great impact on vegetation attributes which in turn modify the C storage and capture. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified. The density and basal area of shrub varied from 1250 to 3750 individuals ha(-1) and 2.79 to 4.92 m(2) ha(-1), respectively. The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of Simpson's index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively. The total biomass and C storage ranged from 6.82 to 15.71 and from 2.93 to 6.76 t ha(-1), respectively. The shrub density, importance value index (IVI), and abundance to frequency ratio (A/F) significantly correlated between high fire and medium fire zone. The basal area was found to be significantly positively correlated between high fire and medium fire, and low and no fire zones, respectively. Two-way cluster analysis reflected various patterns of clustering due to influence of the forest fire which showed that some species have distant clustering while some have smaller cluster. Principal component analysis (PCA) reflects variable scenario with respect to shrub layer. Ventilago calyculata and Zizyphus rotundifolia showed higher correlation between themselves in terms of basal area (BA). The total shrub production was 1.59-3.53 t ha(-1) year(-1) while the C sequestration potential of 0.71-1.57 t ha(-1) year(-1) under different fire regimes. Shrub community in the medium fire zone reflected higher productivity and higher C sequestration in comparison to other fire zone. Among the different plant parts, the biomass accumulation ratio was highest in the root of shrub community among various fire regimes. Screening of species for restoration and different land-use pattern on the basis of biomass accumulation and carbon sequestering potential would be an effective strategy for decision-making in sustainable forest management.","[Jhariya, Manoj Kumar] Sarguja Univ, Dept Farm Forestry, Ambikapur 497001, CG, India",,"Jhariya, MK (corresponding author), Sarguja Univ, Dept Farm Forestry, Ambikapur 497001, CG, India.",manu9589@gmail.com,,,,,,,,30.0,30.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2017,189.0,10,,,,,,,518,10.1007/s10661-017-6246-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-6246-2,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000413354400006,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study first uses DEM (Digital Elevation Model) of Pamir glaciers to develop a denoising model for laser altimetry of ICESat-2 footprints, which reduces the standard deviation of the differences between ICESat-2 footprints and corresponding datum DEM from 13.9 to 3.6 m. Second, the study constructs a calibration processing model for solving the problem that laser footprints obtained at different times have inconsistent plane positions. We calculates plane position and elevation differences between the two laser footprints in the local area of 0.05 x 0.05 degrees from 2018 to 2021. The elevations constructed by laser footprints shows a strong correlation with the datum elevation over the different periods, and effectively preserve the time-series variation information of glacier surface elevation (GSE). Based on these two models, the spatiotemporal variations of the surface elevation of the Pamir glaciers is established as a function of seasons. There are three main conclusions: (1) The GSE in the Pamir increased slightly from 2018 to 2021 at an average rate of +0.02 +/- 0.01 m/year. The time series with elevation increase was located exactly on the glacial ablation zone, and the time series with elevation decrease occurred on the glacial accumulation zone. Both observations demonstrate the surge state of the glacier. (2) The Pamir eastern (Zone I) and northwestern (Zone III) regions had large glacier accumulation areas. GSE in these two regions has increased in recent years at yearly rates of +0.25 +/- 0.13 and +0.06 +/- 0.04 m/year, respectively. In contrast, the GSE of small glaciers in Zones II and IV has decreased at a yearly rate of -0.96 +/- 0.37 and -0.24 +/- 0.18 m/year, respectively. Climate was the primary factor influencing the increase in GSE in Zones I and III. The westerly circulation had been reinforced in recent years, and precipitation had increased dramatically at a rate of +0.99 mm/year in the northwestern section of the Pamir; this was the primary cause of the increase in GSE. (3) The increased precipitation and decreased temperature were both important factors causing an overall +0.02 +/- 0.01 m/year variation of GSE in this region. The GSE in the four sub-regions showed different variation trends because of variations in temperature and precipitation. The external causes that affected the increase in GSE in the region included an average yearly temperature decrease at the rate of 0.54 +/- 0.36 degrees C/year and a total yearly precipitation increase of 0.46 +/- 0.29 mm/year in the study area from 2018 to 2021.","[Du, Weibing; Zheng, Yanchao; Li, Yangyang; Ma, Dandan; Gao, Xin; Pan, Yaming; Wang, Shuangting] Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Surveying & Land Informat Engn, Jiaozuo 454003, Henan, Peoples R China; [Du, Weibing; Bao, Anming; Li, Junli] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Du, Weibing; Bao, Anming; Li, Junli] Xinjiang Key Lab Remote Sensing & Geog Informat S, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China",,"Zheng, YC (corresponding author), Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Surveying & Land Informat Engn, Jiaozuo 454003, Henan, Peoples R China.",212004020028@home.hpu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2022,14.0,19,,,,,,,4923,10.3390/rs14194923,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14194923,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000868042700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Analysis of the effect of land use changes on erosion rate and sediment yield is particularly useful to identify critical areas and define catchment-area treatment plans. This study utilized remote sensing and geographical information system/science (GIS) techniques combined with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) on a pixel basis to estimate soil loss over space and time and prioritized areas for action. The methodology was applied to the Sutlej catchment from the perspective of sedimentation of the Bhakra reservoir, which is leading to the loss of active storage capacity and performance and of the safety and efficiency of many existing hydroelectric projects in the Sutlej and its tributaries that drain the Himalayas. Soil loss estimation using RUSLE was first calibrated using data from three sites, and the calibrated model was then used to estimate catchment soil loss for 21 years (1995-2015). The number of land use/land cover (LULC) classes as 14 and the C factor as 0.63 for agriculture land were optimized using the observed data for the Sutlej catchment. Further, the linkage between soil erosivity and annual precipitation was also established. It was concluded that extensive control treatment would be necessary from the soil and water conservation point of view. Structures like check dams, terraces, bunds, and diversion drains in the upstream can overcome the issue of fragmentation of soil in the Sutlej catchment.","[Gupta, Shishant; Ojha, Chandra Shekhar Prasad] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Roorkee 247667, India; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Adeloye, Adebayo J.] Heriot Watt Univ, Inst Infrastruct & Environm, Edinburgh EH14 4AS, Scotland; [Jain, Sanjay K.] Natl Inst Hydrol, Water Resources Syst Div, Roorkee 247667, India",,"Gupta, S (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Roorkee 247667, India.",sgupta2@ce.iitr.ac.in; cspojha@gmail.com; vijay.singh@ag.tamu.edu; a.j.adeloye@hw.ac.uk; sain.nihr@gov.in,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2023,15.0,20,,,,,,,15177,10.3390/su152015177,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su152015177,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001095136000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The regional difference in xenobiotic levels of breast milk varied with demographic characteristics of mothers and altitudinal variations. The single or multiple pesticides contamination of p,p '-DDE, p,p '-DDT and chlorpyrifos was revealed in 27.45% mothers' milk samples. Among these p,p '-DDE was the major contaminant found in 26.79% samples followed by p,p '-DDT (1.31%) and chlorpyrifos (0.65%). However, residues of other 26 pesticides comprising organochlorines, organophosphorus and synthetic pyrethroids included in this study were below detectable limit (BDL). The determination of a low DDT/DDE ratio (0.050) indicated past exposure of mothers to DDT from the environment. The pesticide residues level in samples drawn from 14 branded infant formulae was BDL. The calculated infants' daily intake (DI) of DDT was 0.0015mgkg(-1) body weight per day compared with a decade-old study (0.021mgkg(-1) body weight per day) suggesting a sharp decline in the residue levels of these pesticides in the Himalayan region. The trend comparison with past studies conducted around the world indicate a decline in the levels of organochlorine pesticide residues in mothers' milk and further drop of DI in infants. However, such comparisons confer very limited utilisation of data generated on pesticide load in mothers' milk and simultaneous infants' DI due to lack of proper research protocol.","[Sharma, Neeta Devi; Sharma, Ishwar D.; Chandel, Rajeshwar Singh] Dr Yashwant Singh Parmar Univ Hort & Forestry, Dept Entomol, Solan, India; [Wise, John C.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",,"Sharma, ND (corresponding author), Dr Yashwant Singh Parmar Univ Hort & Forestry, Dept Entomol, Solan, India.",sharmaneeta16@yahoo.co.in,,,,,,,,6.0,8.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB 19,2016,96.0,3,,,,,225,236,,10.1080/03067319.2015.1137907,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2015.1137907,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000372096800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The incorporation of near-proximal sensor data with satellite data has offered a new angle for rapid, detailed, and reliable assessment of crop biochemical parameters. This study aimed to utilize the higher spatial and spectral resolution of Sentinel-2A multi-spectral instrument (MSI) satellite data in conjunction with near-proximal sensor data to derive the chlorophyll (Chl) content and nitrogen balance index (NBI) of paddy at different growth stages during the monsoon season (2017) in Ranchi district, Jharkhand. The key findings revealed that the satellite-derived Chl content and NBI of paddy were overestimated as compared to the field-based measurements. The correlations between satellite-derived and empirical model-based Chl content and NBI of paddy revealed a R-2 of 0.92-0.99 (p < 0.001) at different growth stages. The Chl content was found higher (20-40 mu g/cm(2)) during the peak growing stage of paddy and subsequently, it decreased (< 20 mu g/cm(2)) by the start of the ripening stage. The root-mean-square error between the empirical model and satellite-based Chl content was from 7.7 to 8.5 mu g/cm2. Thereby, it can be concluded that the MSI sensor with three red-edge bands along with visible and near-infrared has a virtuous capability to quantify the crop biochemical parameters. However, it needs a bias correction to derive Chl content/NBI accurately. The adopted methods of retrieving biochemical parameters at different growth stages would be beneficial for decision-makers in agriculture monitoring and can be incorporated in crop growth modelling and yield predictions.","[Parida, Bikash Ranjan; Kushwaha, Amit; Ranjan, Avinash Kumar] Cent Univ Jharkhand, Dept Geoinformat, Sch Nat Resource Management, Ranchi 835205, Jharkhand, India",,"Ranjan, AK (corresponding author), Cent Univ Jharkhand, Dept Geoinformat, Sch Nat Resource Management, Ranchi 835205, Jharkhand, India.",avinash.ranjan@cuj.ac.in,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,JAN,2022,24.0,1,,,,,1048,1068,,10.1007/s10668-021-01482-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01482-1,,MAY 2021,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000648207200002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In India, groundwater is the backbone of agriculture and drinking purposes. In the present study, an assessment of groundwater reserves was carried out in the Udaipur district, Aravalli range, India. It was observed that the principal aquifer for the availability of groundwater in the studied area is quartzite, phyllite, gneisses, schist, and dolomitic marble, which occur in unconfined to semi-confined zones. Furthermore, all primary chemical ingredients were found within the permissible limit, including granum. We also found that the average annual rainfall days in a year in the study area was 30 from 1957 to 2020, and it has been found that there are chances to receive surplus rainfall once in every five deficit rainfall years. Using integrated remote sensing, GIS, and a field-based spatial modeling approach, it was found that the dynamic GW reserves of the area are 637.42 mcm/annum, and the total groundwater draft is 639.67 mcm/annum. The deficit GW reserves are 2.25 mcm/annum from an average rainfall of 627 mm, hence the stage of groundwater development is 100.67% and categorized as over-exploited. However, as per the relationship between reserves and rainfall events, surplus reserves are available when rainfall exceeds 700 mm. We conclude that enough static GW reserves are available in the studied area to sustain the requirements of the drought period. For the long-term sustainability of groundwater use, controlling groundwater abstraction by optimizing its use, managing it properly through techniques such as sprinkler and drip irrigation, and achieving more crop-per-drop schemes, will go a long way to conserving this essential reserve, and create maximum groundwater recharge structures.","[Shyam, Megha; Meraj, Gowhar; Kanga, Shruti; Sudhanshu; Farooq, Majid] Suresh Gyan Vihar Univ, Ctr Climate Change & Water Res, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India; [Meraj, Gowhar; Farooq, Majid] Govt Jammu & Kashmir, Dept Ecol Environm & Remote Sensing, Srinagar 190018, India; [Singh, Suraj Kumar] Suresh Gyan Vihar Univ, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India; [Sahu, Netrananda] Univ Delhi, Delhi Sch Econ, Dept Geog, Delhi 110007, India; [Kumar, Pankaj] Inst Global Environm Strateg, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan",,"Singh, SK (corresponding author), Suresh Gyan Vihar Univ, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Jaipur 302017, Rajasthan, India.;Kumar, P (corresponding author), Inst Global Environm Strateg, Hayama, Kanagawa 2400115, Japan.",shyam528541@gmail.com; gowharmeraj@gmail.com; shruti.kanga@mygyanvihar.com; cm@mygyanvihar.com; majid_rsgis@yahoo.com; suraj.kumar@mygyanvihar.com; nsahu@geography.du.ac.in; kumar@iges.or.jp,,,,,,,,17.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2022,14.0,4,,,,,,,648,10.3390/w14040648,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14040648,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000762522500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The melting rate varies with the debris cover thickness and glacier orientation. The present study quantifies glacier melting rate attributed to varying thickness of debris cover in the Karakoram. We observed daily melting rates by installing ablation stakes over debris-free and debris-covered ice during a field expedition. The stakes were installed on glacier surface with debris cover thickness ranges between 0.5 and 40 cm at selected experimental sites during the ablation period (September and October 2018) and (July to August 2019). We selected three glaciers including Ghulkin, Hinarchi, and Hoper facing east, south, and north, respectively to assess the role of glacier orientation on melting rates. We observed that the debris-free ice melts faster than the debris-covered ice. Intriguingly, a thin debris layer of 0.5 cm does not enhance melting compared to the clean ice which is inconsistent with the earlier studies. The melting rate decreases as the thickness of debris cover increases at all the three selected glaciers. Furthermore, south-facing glacier featured the highest melting (on average similar to 25% more). However, the north and east-facing glaciers revealed almost same melting rates. We observed that the average degree-day factors (DDF) slightly varies within a range of 0.58-0.73 and 0.55-0.68 cm degrees C-1 day(-1) for debris-free and 0.5 cm debris-covered ice, respectively, however, DDF largely reduces to 0.13-0.25 cm degrees C-1 day(-1) for 40 cm debris-covered ice.

Present study was undertaken to assess economics, energy, and environmental parameters of common diversified crop rotations (maize-tomato, and maize-toria-wheat) vis-a-vis traditional crop rotations like maize-wheat, maize + ginger and rice-wheat of the northwestern Himalayan region of India. Results revealed that maize-tomato and maize + ginger crop rotations being on par with each other produced significantly higher system productivity in terms of maize equivalent yield (30.2-36.2 t/ha) than other crop rotations (5.04-7.68 t/ha). But interestingly in terms of energy efficiencies, traditional maize-wheat system (energy efficiency 7.9, human energy profitability of 177.8 and energy profitability of 6.9 MJ/ha) was significantly superior over other systems. Maize + ginger rotation showed greater competitive advantage over other rotations because of less consumption of non-renewable energy resources. Similarly, maize-tomato rotation had ability of the production process to exploit natural resources due to 14-38 % less use of commercial or purchased energy sources over other crop rotations. Vegetable-based crop rotations (maize + ginger and maize-tomato) maintained significantly the least carbon footprint (0.008 and 0.019 kg CO2 eq./kg grain, respectively) and the highest profitability (154,322 and 274,161 Rs./ha net return, respectively) over other crop rotations. As the greatest inputs of energy and carbon across the five crop rotations were nitrogen fertilizer (15-29 % and 17-28 %, respectively), diesel (14-24 % and 8-19 %, respectively) and irrigation (10-27 % and 11-44 %, respectively), therefore, alternative sources like organic farming, conservation agriculture practices, soil and water conservation measures, rain water harvesting etc. should be encouraged to reduce dependency of direct energy and external carbon inputs particularly in sub-Himalayas of India.","[Singh, Raman Jeet; Sharma, N.

The present study aims to assess the heavy metal concentration in the size-fractionated sediments of River Ganga, and ascertain the sources of contamination in upper Himalayan stretch of around 300 km. The bed sediments of River Ganga were collected from Gomukh, Bhojwasa, Gangotri, Jhala Bridge, Chinyalisaur, Devaprayag, and Rishikesh; and these were size-fractionated in the range of 0-75, 75-150, 150-200, 200-250, 350-300, 300-450, 450-600 mu m par-ticle size to determine the concentration of heavy metals associated with each range of particle size using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). The mean concentration of the metals in the sediments varied in the order Al (126 g/kg) > Fe (68 g/kg) > Cr (79 mg/kg) > Zn (67 mg/kg) > Pb (59 mg/kg) > Ni (38 mg/kg) > Cu (36 mg/ kg) > Cd (2 mg/kg), and representing more affinity of metals with finer particle size of sediments. Contamination Factor and Metal Enrichment Factor indicated that sediments in the lower stretch were contaminated and enriched with many toxic metals. Geo-accumulation index, Sediment Pollution Index, and Pollution Load Index revealed that the sediments of Chinyalisaur, Devaprayag, and Rishikesh were moderately to strongly polluted and are progressively getting deteriorated by metals, thus, classifying these locations as hotspots of contami-nation. The major sources of Al and Fe were found to be natural; whereas Cr, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu and Cd were mainly contributed by anthropogenic sources. The study stresses for immediate interventions to control further contamination by restricting addition of wastewater directly to River Ganga, or through other streams in Ganga basin.","[Radhakrishnan, Naveen; Taneja, Sonam; Ambastha, Saurav; Pipil, Harsh; Haritash, Anil Kumar] Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Bawana Rd Shahbad Daulatpur, Delhi, India",,"Haritash, AK (corresponding author), Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Bawana Rd Shahbad Daulatpur, Delhi, India.",akharitash@dce.ac.in,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2023,188.0,,,,,,,,114650,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114650,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114650,,FEB 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000931977100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The observed daily mean aerosol optical depth (AOD, at 500 nm) at the site varied from 0.01 to 0.14. However, 75 % of the observed AOD lies below 0.05 during the study period. Seasonal peaks of AOD occurred in spring as 0.06 and minimum in winter as 0.03 which represents the aged background aerosols at the site. Yearly mean AOD at 500 nm is found to be around 0.04 and inter-annual variations of AOD is very small (nearly +/- 0.01). Angstrom exponent (a) varied seasonally from 0.73 in spring to 1.5 in autumn. About 30 % of the observed a lies below 0.8 which are the indicative for the presence of coarse-mode aerosols at the site. The station exhibits absorbing aerosol features which prominently occurred during spring and that may be attributed by the transported anthropogenic aerosol from Indo-Gangatic Plain (IGP). Results were well substantiated with the air mass back-trajectory analysis. Furthermore, seasonal mean of single scattering albedo (SSA at 500 nm) varied from of 0.94 to 0.98 and a general increasing trend is noticed from 400 to 870 nm wavelengths. These features are apparently regional characteristics of the site. Aerosol asymmetry factor (AS) decreases gradually from 400 to 870 nm and varied from 0.66 to 0.69 at 500 nm across the seasons. Dominance of desert-dust aerosols, associated by coarse mode, is indicated by tri-modal features of aerosol volume size distribution over the station during the entire seasons.","[Ningombam, Shantikumar S.; Bagare, S.

A multi-instrument research campaign was performed in Delhi during December 2015-February 2016 aimed at exploring the pollution levels and the contribution of various sources to particulate matter (PM) concentrations, black carbon (BC) aerosols, and trace gases. The weak winds (<5-6ms(-1)) along with the shallow boundary layer favoured the formation of thick and persistent fog conditions, which along with the high BC (24.4 +/- 12.2gm(-3)) concentrations lead to the formation of smog. Very high pollution levels were recorded during the campaign, with mean PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO, and O-3 concentrations of 245.5 +/- 109.8gm(-3), 145.5 +/- 69.5gm(-3), 1.7 +/- 0.5ppm, 7.9 +/- 2.3ppb, and 31.3 +/- 18.4ppb, respectively.

In addition, the hot-spot pollution sources in the greater Delhi area were determined via bivariate plots and conditional bivariate probability function (CBPF), while the distant sources were examined via the concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis. The results show that the highest aerosol absorption and scattering coefficients, PM, and trace gas concentrations are detected for weak winds (<2ms(-1)) with a preference for eastern directions, revealing high contribution from local sources and accumulation of pollutants within urban Delhi.","[Dumka, Umesh C.] Aryabhatta Res Inst Observat Sci, Naini Tal 263001, India; [Tiwari, Suresh] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, New Delhi Branch, New Delhi 110060, India; [Kaskaoutis, Dimitris G.] Natl Observ Athens, Inst Environm Res & Sustainable Dev, Athens 11810, Greece; [Soni, Vijay K.; Attri, Shiv D.] Indian Metrol Dept, Lodhi Rd, New Delhi 110003, India; [Safai, Promod D.] Indian Inst Trop Meteorol, Pune 411008, Maharashtra, India",,"Dumka, UC (corresponding author), Aryabhatta Res Inst Observat Sci, Naini Tal 263001, India.",dumka@aries.res.in,,,,,,,,47.0,47.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2019,26.0,4,,,,,3771,3794,,10.1007/s11356-018-3885-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-3885-y,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000457726700060,View Full Record in Web of Science

Taking a case of multifunctional landscape in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan region, we carried out a social survey of ES, focusing on preference, perceived change, and observed relationship among six major ES from the local people's perspective. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, data collection was done from 300 households from 10 categories of human settlements, based on watershed and land cover types. Garrett mean score (GMS), ordinal logistic regression estimates, and Chi-square test were performed for quantitative data, while an inductive approach was adopted for qualitative data analysis. The results show that at the landscape level, local people preferred water yield (GMS = 70) and crop production (GMS = 66) as the most preferred ES, whereas habitat quality (GMS = 37) and carbon sequestration (GMS = 35) were among the least preferred ES. More than 70% of the respondents believed that the supply of crop production has decreased over the last two decades; however, the supply of other provisioning and non-provisioning ES has increased as observed by majority of the respondents. Among the 15 pairs of ES, local people believe that co-occurrence of ES is possible. Majority of the respondents said that there exist synergistic relationship among 13 pairs of ES, except crop production which is negatively related with timber production and carbon sequestration. Among the identified trade-offs in ES, majority of local people believed that direct trade-offs (i.e., linear inverse relationship) is dominant as observed in 8 pairs of ES, followed by concave and convex trade-offs. Based on our analysis, we argue that the preference and perceived change of ES is more dependent on spatial heterogeneity of communities (i.e., watershed type, municipal category, and land cover type of residence) than socio-economic determinants. Further, we have discussed and suggested few policy and management measures including place-based spatial assessment of the social demand and preference, embracing agroforestry practices in ecosystem management programs, mainstreaming non-local ES in local decision making by incentives, and optimizing the supply of desired ES though integrated biophysical and socio-economic assessment of the landscape.","[Aryal, Kishor; Maraseni, Tek; Apan, Armando] Univ Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Aryal, Kishor] Minist Ind Tourism Forests & Environm, Dhangadhi, Sudoorpaschim P, Nepal; [Maraseni, Tek] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Eco Environm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Apan, Armando] Univ Philippines Diliman, Inst Environm Sci & Meteorol, Quezon City, Philippines; [Maraseni, Tek] Univ Southern Queensland, Block Q 525, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia",,"Maraseni, T (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Block Q 525, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",Tek.Maraseni@usq.edu.au,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 15,2023,344.0,,,,,,,,118522,10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118522,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118522,,JUN 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001030546300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The transport mechanism, however, is not well understood. In this study, we use short-lived reactive aromatics as proxies to diagnose transport of pollutants to Tibet. In situ observations of short-lived reactive aromatics across the Tibetan Plateau are analyzed using a regional chemistry and transport model. The model performance using the current emission inventories over the region is poor due to problems in the inventories and model transport. Top-down emissions constrained by satellite observations of glyoxal are a factor of 2-6 higher than the a priori emissions over the industrialized Indo-Gangetic Plain. Using the top-down emissions, agreement between model simulations and surface observations of aromatics improves. We find enhancements of reactive aromatics over Tibet by a factor of 6 on average due to rapid transport from India and nearby regions during the presence of a high-altitude cut-off low system. Our results suggest that the cut-off low system is a major pathway for long-range transport of pollutants such as black carbon. The modeling analysis reveals that even the state-of-the-science high-resolution reanalysis cannot simulate this cut-off low system accurately, which probably explains in part the underestimation of black carbon deposition over Tibet in previous modeling studies. Another model deficiency of underestimating pollution transport from the south is due to the complexity of terrain, leading to enhanced transport. It is therefore challenging for coarse-resolution global climate models to properly represent the effects of long-range transport of pollutants on the Tibetan environment and the subsequent consequence for regional climate forcing.","[Zhang, Ruixiong; Wang, Yuhang; Zhang, Yuzhong; Qu, Hang; Smeltzer, Charles; Li, Jianfeng] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Earth & Atmospher Sci, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [He, Qiusheng] Taiyuan Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Environm & Safety, Taiyuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Laiguo] MEP, Urban Environm & Ecol Res Ctr, SCIES, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Alvarado, Leonardo M.

The major aims were to study, quantify, and understand the concentrations and variations of TSP and major water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) in the valley with limited data. The annual average TSP mass concentration was 135.50 +/- 62.91 mu g/m(3). The average analyzed total WSIIs accounted for 14.4% of total TSP mass. Major anions and cations in TSP samples were SO42- and Ca2+, respectively. Seasonal differences in atmospheric conditions explain the clear seasonal variations of ions, with higher concentrations during pre-monsoon and winter and lower concentrations during the monsoon period. Neutralization factor calculations suggested that Ca2+ in the Pokhara valley mostly neutralizes the acidity in the atmosphere. Principle component analysis, NO3- / SO42- ratio, and non-sea salt fraction calculations suggested that the WSIIs in the valley were mostly derived from anthropogenic activities and crustal mineral dust, which was also supported by the results from precipitation chemistry over the central Himalayas, Nepal. In addition, back trajectories analysis has suggested that the air pollution transported from and through Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) during the dry periods, which has resulted in high ionic loadings during this period.

While several previous studies explored the association between epiphyte diversity and host characteristics, very little is known about the generality of such associations at larger spatial scales. We aim to explore the associations between diversity and distribution of epiphytic orchids and host characteristics in different localities in Nepal. Epiphytic orchids and their hosts were recorded along the transects in total of 23,539 host individuals. To describe the diversity of orchids in the different localities, a rarefaction function was used. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to explore the associations with locality, host characteristics, and their interactions with locality. In total, we recorded 141 species of orchids growing on 192 host species. The five localities significantly differed in orchid diversity and abundance. The number of orchid individuals per host species significantly increased with increasing number of host individuals. Species richness, abundances, occupancy of orchid species on host species and composition of orchids varied across the localities. Species richness and abundance was significantly higher on hosts in the higher strata and differed between families of host species. Abundance was higher on evergreen hosts. Composition of orchid communities are also associated with host characteristics, such as habit (shrub/tree/climber), bark texture, nature (deciduous/evergreen) and the plant families of host species. This study revealed a high diversity of epiphytic orchids in the localities studied and strong associations between the orchids and their hosts. Future studies looking at the relationships between epiphyte communities and host characteristics need to identify relationships at a wider scale in order to determine whether they are really general rather than site-specific.","[Timsina, Binu; Munzbergova, Zuzana; Kindlmann, Pavel; Shrestha, Bikram] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Inst Environm Studies, Benatska 2, Prague 12801, Czech Republic; [Timsina, Binu; Rokaya, Maan B.; Kindlmann, Pavel] Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Dept Biodivers Res, Belidla 4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic; [Rokaya, Maan B.; Munzbergova, Zuzana] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Bot, Zamek 1, Pruhonice 25243, Czech Republic; [Bhattarai, Bishnu] Tribhuvan Univ, Birendra Multiple Campus, Kirtipur, Nepal; [Raskoti, Bhakta B.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Bot, State Key Lab Systemat & Evolutionary Bot, Beijing 100093, Peoples R China",,"Timsina, B (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Bot, Inst Environm Studies, Benatska 2, Prague 12801, Czech Republic.;Timsina, B (corresponding author), Czech Acad Sci, Global Change Res Inst, Dept Biodivers Res, Belidla 4a, Brno 60300, Czech Republic.",binu.timsina@gmail.com,,,,,,,,19.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2016,25.0,13,,,,,2803,2819,,10.1007/s10531-016-1205-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1205-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000387475900014,View Full Record in Web of Science

The formation water in the Halahatang depression can be characterized as CaCl2 type with high total dissolved solids (TDS) generally. The TDS concentration has a weak negative relationship with the depth, and is above 200 g/L in the North Region (north of the pinch-out line), then gradually decreases to the south, but is still greater than 50 g/L. The ion-proportionality coefficients of formation water, including the sodium-chlorine coefficient, desulfurization coefficient and metamorphic coefficient, reflect that the present strata are well sealed and had once experienced strong water-rock interactions. Furthermore, the source and evolution of the formation water presents a closed relationship with the hydrocarbon accumulation. The meteoric source of the formation water indicates the denuding by the Ordovician formation and the damage from the previous oil and gas reservoirs. The reservoir quality was also improved due to the strong karstification during the denudation, which was beneficial for hydrocarbon accumulation. The distribution of the TDS concentration is controlled by the caprock (Sangtamu Formation) and the high salinity fluids from overlying strata and adjacent regions. A geological model was established, the high salinity fluids penetrated the Ordovician strata resulting in the TDS increases in the northern part. Whereas, the South Region (south of the pinch-out line) was less affected due to the shielding layer of the O(3)s. The favorable preservation conditions reflected by the high TDS and ion-proportionality coefficients correspond to the stable subsidence of strata since the Triassic era, the oil and gas reservoirs formed in the Himalayan can be preserved.","[Xu, Tong; Zhu, Chuanqing; Jiang, Xiaoxue; Tang, Boning] China Univ Petr, State Key Lab Petr Resources & Prospecting, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Xu, Tong; Zhu, Chuanqing; Jiang, Xiaoxue; Tang, Boning] China Univ Petr, Coll Geosci, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiang; Zhang, Haizu; Zhang, Baoshou] PetroChina Tarim Oilfield Co, Res Inst Explorat & Dev, Korla 841000, Peoples R China",,"Zhu, CQ (corresponding author), China Univ Petr, State Key Lab Petr Resources & Prospecting, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.;Zhu, CQ (corresponding author), China Univ Petr, Coll Geosci, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",tong_xu111@163.com; tong_xu111@163.com; tong_xu111@163.com; tong_xu111@163.com; tong_xu111@163.com; tong_xu111@163.com; tong_xu111@163.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2022,14.0,5,,,,,,,756,10.3390/w14050756,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14050756,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000771512200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present study investigated the changes in land use in the SCL and their impact on the psychological wellbeing of the indigenous people of the region. Longitudinal data for over 15 years on land-use patterns and cross-sectional data from 481 respondents across 52 villages representing six states in India's North East that are part of the Indian Himalayas were utilized for the study. To analyze subjective wellbeing, Cantril's self-anchoring scale was used, followed by focused group discussions to triangulate the self-reported responses. Results reveal that the respondents were aware of the effects of landscape changes on their psychological wellbeing. These changes mostly represented a decline in shifting cultivation (SC), land ownership, food systems, social cohesion, cultural fulfillment, the diversity of cultivated native plants, and the availability of wild edible plants. Although the decline in SCL led to a gain in the area under green cover, it led to a marked decline in the diversity of cultivated and wild edible plants. This, the respondents perceived as adversely impacting their wellbeing. Empirical analysis established positive effect of SC on the psychological wellbeing of the respondents. However, a decline in SC seemed to have had an adverse impact on the perception of their wellbeing and thus increasing the migration.

Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)-VEGETATION sensor's Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product, aggregated at 0.5A degrees aEuro parts per thousand x 0.5A degrees grid level for the same period (2004 and 2005), was used to correlate the with CH4 concentration. Analysis showed mean monthly CH4 concentration during the Kharif season varied from 1,704 parts per billion volume (ppbv) to 1,780 ppbv with the lowest value in May and the highest value in September. Correspondingly, mean NDVI varied from 0.28 (May) to 0.53 (September). Analysis of correlation between CH4 concentration and NDVI values over India showed positive correlation (r = 0.76; n = 6) in Kharif season. Further analysis using land cover information showed characteristic low correlation in natural vegetation region and high correlation in agricultural area. Grids, particularly falling in the Indo-Gangetic Plains showed positive correlation. This could be attributed to the rice crop which is grown as a predominant crop during this period. The CH4 concentration pattern matched well with growth pattern of rice with the highest concentration coinciding with the peak growth period of crop in the September. Characteristically low correlation was observed (r = 0.1; n = 6) in deserts of Rajasthan and forested Himalayan ecosystem. Thus, the paper emphasizes the synergistic use of different satellite based data in understanding the variability of atmospheric CH4 concentration in relation to vegetation.","[Goroshi, Sheshakumar K.; Singh, R.

Adaptation of birds to changing physical environment can be well understood by analyzing their habitat preferences, and foraging dynamics explored to a limited extent in the Himalayan region, as yet. To achieve a comprehensive understanding of avian guild structure, we used multivariate statistical techniques to classify bird species according to their similarities in foraging patterns and habitat preferences. Observations based on habitat and diet affinities accounted for rich avian diversity with a total of 208 bird species (about 15% of country's avifauna) recorded from six different sites during 1 year survey. Unweighted pair-group average cluster analysis performed on the families revealed ten feeding and fifteen habitat guilds among 63 bird families observed. Subtropical forests harbored more species followed by urban forests and agricultural landscapes. Insectivorous and omnivorous outnumbered other feeding guilds in the study area. Bird assemblages were richer in protected areas and semi-disturbed landscapes and did not show significant variation between the seasons. Results of the study revealed that different functional groups of birds behaved differently, primarily induced by choice of food. The site heterogeneity favored avifaunal persistence by providing favorable foraging, roosting, and nesting opportunities to birds. Composition of avian guilds indicated level of intactness and ecological integrity of ecosystems studied. This outcome thus sets the background for long-term analysis of bird-habitat relationship and their foraging dynamics. The study has the relevance for decision-makers to integrate avian guild structure as an essential ingredient in formulating conservation strategies.","[Sohil, Asha; Sharma, Neeraj] Univ Jammu, Inst Mt Environm, Jammu, India",,"Sharma, N (corresponding author), Univ Jammu, Inst Mt Environm, Jammu, India.",nirazsharma@gmail.com,,,,,,,,13.0,17.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 26,2020,9.0,1,,,,,,,49,10.1186/s13717-020-00250-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13717-020-00250-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000576375900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although it is far away from the Himalayan geothermal belt, hot springs with high contents of SiO2, Li, B and As are widely distributed there. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify the geochemical genesis of the major constituents in geothermal waters and cold groundwaters from the study areas as well as the related hydrogeochemical processes. The results indicate that these constituents can be represented by six factors: factor 1 (F-, Li+, K+ and SiO2), factor 2 (EC, Cl- and Na+), factor 3 (pH HCO3-, Mg2+ and Ca2+), factor 4 (B, As, Fe and Al), factor 5 (SO42- and Sr) and factor 6 (NO3-). Generally, the dissolution of silicate and carbonate minerals is the predominant geochemical processes responsible for the occurrence of the constituents that constitute factors 1 and 3, respectively. In contrast, although halite is not a primary mineral in the aquifer matrix, its leaching results in the enrichment of chloride and sodium in the groundwaters, which make significant contributions to the high EC values of some water samples. Although arsenic and boron are associated with factor 4, elevated levels of these elements in groundwater may be derived from the leaching of crystalline rocks (like granite and gneiss) rather than the input of potential magmatic fluids. Moreover, anthropogenic activity has an impact on the hydrochemistry of the groundwaters as well, as indicated by the elevated concentrations of nitrate (the sole component of factor 6) in some samples. It is also worth noting that the PCA results may not match well with the hydrogeochemical analyses. Factor 5 is composed of sulfate and strontium, whereas celestite is unlikely to be the primary source of sulfate in groundwater.","[Zhang, Xiaobo; Guo, Qinghai; Liu, Mingliang; Yin, Zuowei; Guo, Wei; Li, Jiexiang; Zhou, Chao] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaobo; Guo, Qinghai; Liu, Mingliang; Yin, Zuowei; Guo, Wei; Li, Jiexiang; Zhou, Chao] China Univ Geosci, Gemol Inst, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jin] China Univ Geosci, Fac Engn, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Canhai; Zhu, Mingcheng] Huanghe Hydropower Dev CO LTD, State Power Investment Corp, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China",,"Guo, QH; Yin, ZW (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Guo, QH; Yin, ZW (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Gemol Inst, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",qhguo2006@gmail.com; yinzuowei@cug.edu.cn,,,,,,,,20.0,21.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG,2016,75.0,16,,,,,,,1187,10.1007/s12665-016-5991-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5991-9,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000381986800035,View Full Record in Web of Science

Spectral variation of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) and Asymmetry Parameter (AP) were analysed using AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data. The analysis revealed that coarse particles were dominant in summer and pre-monsoon, while fine particles were more pronounced in winter and post-monsoon. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal variations of Shortwave Direct Aerosol Radiative Forcing (SDARF) and Shortwave Direct Aerosol Radiative Forcing Efficiency (SDARFE) at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA), SURface (SUR) and within ATMosphere (ATM) were calculated using SBDART model. The atmospheric Heating Rate (HR) associated with SDARF(ATM) were also computed. It was observed that the monthly averaged SDARF(TOA) and SDARF(SUR) were found to be negative leading to positive SDARF(ATM) during all the months over all sites. The increments in net atmospheric forcing lead to maximum HR in November December and May. The seasonal analysis of SDARF revealed that SDARF(TOA) and SDARF(SUR) were negative during all seasons. The SW atmospheric absorption translates to highest atmospheric HR during summer over Karachi and during pre-monsoon over Lahore, Jaipur and Kanpur. Like SDARF, the monthly and seasonal variations of SDARFE(TOA) and SDARFE(SUR) were found to be negative, resulting in positive atmospheric forcing. Additionally, to compare the model estimated forcing against AERONET derived forcing, the regression analysis of AERONET-SBDART forcing were carried out. It was observed that SDARF at SUR and TOA showed relatively higher correlation over Lahore, moderate over Jaipur and Kanpur and lower over Karachi. Finally, the analysis of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model revealed that air masses were arriving from multiple source locations.

Relevant parameters such as suspended sediment concentration (SSC), particle size distribution (PSD), shape, and mineralogical composition were measured with an online multi-frequency acoustic instrument and based on manually taken samples from the end of the sand trap of the Toss HPP in the Himalayan region, India. In the laboratory, the samples were analyzed using the gravimetric method, laser diffraction, turbidity, dynamic digital image processing, scanning electron microscope, petrography analysis, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The online instrument and the samples provided measurement results at a single point. To investigate vertical gradients in concentration and particle sizes, additional samples were collected 9 times at 7 relative water depths. The SSC, most particle sizes, and particle shape were found to be evenly distributed over depth except d(90), i.e. the diameter which is not exceeded by 90% of the particle mass. d(90) measured at 76% of the water depth was in the range of fine sand and was multiplied by 1.05 to obtain an average value representative for the entire depth. Improved methodologies to quantify both particle shape and size in an analytical model for hydro-abrasive erosion are proposed. Also, the PSD measuring performance of laser diffraction and dynamic imaging was studied and similar values of the median particle sizes were obtained from both instruments. Further, multi-frequency acoustic, turbidity and laser diffraction techniques were found suitable for SSC measurement at the test case HPP.

Two sets of measurements were used in this study, which included the air samplings of BC particles during 2004-2006 and the ice core drillings of BC deposition during 1986-1994. Two numerical models were used to analyze the measured data. A global chemical transportation model (MOZART-4) was used to analyze the BC transport from the source regions, and a radiative transfer model (SNICAR) was used to study the effect of BC on snow albedo. The results show that during 1991-1992, there was a strong spike in the BC deposition at Muztagh Ata, suggesting that there was an unusual emission in the upward region during this period. This high peak of BC deposition was investigated by using the global chemical transportation model (MOZART-4). The analysis indicated that the emissions from large Kuwait fires at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991 caused this high peak of the BC concentrations and deposition (about 3-4 times higher than other years) at Muztagh Ata Mountain, suggesting that the upward BC emissions had important impacts on this remote site located on the northern Tibetan Plateau. Thus, there is a need to quantitatively estimate the effect of surrounding emissions on the BC concentrations on the northern Tibetan Plateau. In this study, a sensitivity study with four individual BC emission regions (Central Asia, Europe, the Persian Gulf, and South Asia) was conducted by using the MOZART-4 model. The result suggests that during the normal period (non-Kuwait fires), the largest effect was due to the Central Asia source (44 %) during the Indian monsoon period, while during the non-monsoon period, the largest effect was due to the South Asia source (34 %). The increase in radiative forcing increase (RFI) due to the deposition of BC on snow was estimated by using the radiative transfer model (SNICAR). The results show that under the fresh snow assumption, the estimated increase in RFI ranged from 0.2 to 2.5 W m(-2), while under the aged snow assumption, the estimated increase in RFI ranged from 0.9 to 5.7 W m(-2). During the Kuwait fires period, the RFI values increased about 2-5 times higher than in the normal period, suggesting a significant increase for the snow melting on the northern Tibetan Plateau due to this fire event.

This river system ( 750,000 km 2) presents an exceptional temporal and spatial water chemistry variability compared to other major rivers. The total dissolved solid ( TDS) concentration of the Huanghe varied over 2 to 3 orders of magnitude throughout the basin, with a median TDS concentration of 452 mg/L, which is about 4 times the world spatial median value (WSM). In particular, the concentrations of Na+ + K+, SO42-, and Cl- were 10 - 20 times higher than in other major world rivers. Similar to the Changjiang ( Yangtze River) and many other Himalayan rivers, the TDS at a given station is seasonally variable and inversely related to river runoff with a variation factor less than 2.0, despite a water dilution of fourfold to fivefold in the summer flood season. In addition to chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks, evaporation and fractional crystallization were found to be the major natural process controlling the major element chemistry of the Huanghe, owing to the abundance of loess and clastic rocks under arid and semiarid climates. A persistent increasing trend from year to year has been observed in the concentrations of TDS and all the salts except for HCO3- at all main-channel stations except for the uppermost Lanzhou. The rate of increase in the TDS concentration was the highest in the middle reaches (10.52 mg/L yr(-1) at Toudaoguai) and remained to be unusually high in the lower reaches (5.5 mg/L yr(-1) at Stations Luokou and Lijin). The increasing trend coincided with a significant decrease in water discharge at most of the main-channel stations in the past 40 years, and is attributed to increasing regulations of reservoirs and intensive water withdrawal for irrigation and diversions, as well as many other anthropogenic processes. Despite the increasing trend in TDS concentrations, the seaward TDS flux to the sea by the Huanghe has decreased dramatically from more than 20 x 10(9) kg/yr in the 1960s to less than 10 x 10(9) kg/yr at present, due to the sharp decrease in water discharge ( sometimes completely dried up) in the lower reaches of the river. The significant decreases in sea-ward fluxes of water and dissolved salts are expected to have profound physical, ecological, and socioeconomic impacts on the lower reaches of the river, the coastal areas and the Bohai Sea.","Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; Univ Manitoba, Dept Environm & Geog, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; Univ Manitoba, Dept Chem, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; Univ Paris 06, CNRS, Sisyphe, F-75252 Paris, France",,"Peking Univ, Coll Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",wangf@ms.umanitoba.ca,,,,,,,,140.0,162.0,,,,,,,,,,,AUG 27,2005,19.0,3,,,,,,,GB3016,10.1029/2004GB002325,http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2004GB002325,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000231569400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This implies a risk of losing vital information from previous generations regarding plants and their use in traditional medicine. The objective of this study is to catalog the ways employed by inhabitants of the Garhwal Himalayas as part of their traditional approaches to healthcare. Information was gathered through snowball sampling using a questionnaire combined with informal interviews. This was supplemented by discussions with peers and practitioners prominent in this healing technique. The homogeneity within ethnomedicinal knowledge of these rural residents was tested using the informant consensus factor (Fic). The calculation of the fidelity value (FL) and the cultural importance index (CI) were made regarding the population's dependency on plants. A total of 88 plant species from 44 families and 80 genera were identified as medicines for various complaints. Leaves were the most frequently used plant part followed by fruits, seeds, roots, bark, and flowers/buds. The largest number of taxa (15 species) were used for treatment of skin ailments (with Fic score of 0.85) followed by wounds, coughs, and digestive problems. There was a significant relationship observed between the medicinal plants used and distance (time of access) and family income. The present study will provide baseline information to be established for future research. The available information could help to discover new drugs for the pharmaceutical industry. Thus, the study revealed that the plants that have high scores of FL and CI can be used to discover new drug extraction in the future for further studies.","[Kumar, Munesh; Rawat, Sushma] HNB Garhwal Univ, Dept Forestry & Nat Resources, Srinagar 249161, Uttarakhand, India; [Nagar, Bhuvnesh] Coll Hort & Forestry, Dept Forest Prod & Utilizat, Jhalawar 326023, Rajasthan, India; [Kumar, Amit] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Pala, Nazir A.] Sher E Kashmir Univ Agr Sci & Technol Kashmir, Fac Forestry, Jammu 190025, Jammu & Kashmir, India; [Bhat, Jahangeer A.] Rani Lakshmi Bai Cent Agr Univ, Dept Forest Prod & Utilizat, Coll Hort & Forestry, Jhansi 284003, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Bussmann, Rainer W.] Ilia State Univ, Inst Bot, Dept Ethnobot, Tbilisi 0105, Georgia; [Cabral-Pinto, Marina] Univ Aveiro, Dept Geosci, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Kunwar, Ripu] Ethnobot Soc Nepal, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal",,"Cabral-Pinto, M (corresponding author), Univ Aveiro, Dept Geosci, Campus Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",muneshmzu@yahoo.com; rawatsushma26@gmail.com; bhuwi@hotmail.com; amit.agl09@gmail.com; nazirpaul@gmail.com; jahan191@gmail.com; rainer.bussmann@iliauni.edu.ge; marinacp@ua.pt; ripukunwar@gmail.com,,,,,,,,13.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,FEB,2021,18.0,4,,,,,,,1509,10.3390/ijerph18041509,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041509,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000623556400001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Varghese, R; Behera, MD",,,,"Varghese, Roma; Behera, M. D.",,,Annual and seasonal variations in gross primary productivity across the agro-climatic regions in India,ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a vital ecosystem variable that is used as a proxy to study the functional behaviour of a terrestrial ecosystem and its ability to regulate atmospheric CO2 by working as a carbon pool. India, having the potential terrestrial ecosystem dynamics to absorb the atmospheric carbon dioxide to some extent, is one of the least-explored regions in terms of carbon monitoring studies. The current study evaluates the applicability of a newly developed, quantum yield-based, remote sensing data-driven diagnostic model called the Southampton Carbon Flux (SCARF). This model was used to estimate the annual and seasonal variability of the terrestrial GPP over the Indian region with a spatial resolution of 1 km during 2008. This modified version of the conventional production efficiency model successfully predicted GPP using meteorological variables (PAR, air temperature and dew point temperature), the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation and quantum yield of C3 and C4 plants as the key input parameters. The annual GPP values were in the range from 0 to 4147.55 g C m(-2) year(-1), with a mean value of 1507.32 g C m(-2) year(-1). The maximum and minimum GPP were during the summer monsoon and pre-monsoon, respectively. The seasonal and annual distributions of GPP over the study area obtained using the SCARF model, and the MODIS GPP product (MOD17A2H) were similar. However, MODIS was found to underestimate the GPP in all regions and an overestimation in eastern Himalaya region. The study reveals that environmental scalars, specifically water stress, are the pivotal controlling variables responsible for the variation of GPP in India. The estimates of the GPP in different regions of the study area were made using SCARF, and an eddy covariance technique was similar. The SCARF model can be used to estimate GPP on a global scale. SCARF appears to be a better model in terms of the simplicity of the algorithm, performance and resolution. Thus, it may give higher accuracy in carbon monitoring studies.","[Varghese, Roma; Behera, M.

The catchments traditionally provide food and income for local communities, and they are increasingly important for ecological functions, particularly downstream water use. While the hydrological effects of increasing forest cover are generally unclear in the mid-hills region, mismatched perceptions of forest-water relationships between sections of Nepalese society and scientists challenge the management of the catchments in meeting traditional community needs and growing water demand sustainably. This paper shows the prevalence of the culturally formed notion of more forest-more water within broader Nepalese society and the conservation-centric attitude of forest policymakers, who focus on reforestation and afforestation. These perceptions contradict general scientific evidence that shows forest development reduces catchment water yield. Conversely, the results of semistructured interviews (n =150) conducted among members of community forest user groups (CFUGs) in the Roshi Khola catchment of the mid-hills district Kavre showed that 44% of respondents consider that forests contribute to increased water quantity, and 37% think forests decrease it. Furthermore, the respondents that viewed forests as reducing water quantity disliked pine forests because these allegedly caused the reduction. interestingly, there was a positive correlation between the duration of membership in the CFUG and the perception that forests increase water. Thus, while there is a high research need to understand the forest-water relationships in the mid-hills, extensive communication of research results and deliberation about them are crucial to developing widely acceptable plans for managing the catchments. This is particularly important in the context of expanding community forestry practices and the current debate on scientific forestry presented by Nepal's key forestry documents, including the Forestry Sector Strategy 2016-2025 and Forest Policy 2019.","[Badu, Manoj; Nuberg, Ian; Cedamon, Edwin] Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Sharma, Subodh] Kathmandu Univ, Aquat Ecol Ctr, Sch Sci, POB 6250, Dhulikhel, Nepal",,"Badu, M (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Agr Food & Wine, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",manojbadu@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2019,39.0,4,,,,,R27,R36,,10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-18-00023.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-18-00023.1,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000593007100004,View Full Record in Web of Science

The snow-covered areas of the selected glaciers were identified and classified using supervised and rule-based image analysis techniques in three different seasons. Accuracy assessment of the classified images indicated that the supervised classification technique performed slightly better than the rule-based technique. Snow-covered areas on the selected glaciers were generally reduced during the study period but at different rates. Glaciers reached maximum areal snow coverage in winter and pre-monsoon seasons and minimum areal snow coverage in monsoon seasons, with the lowest snow-covered area occurring in August and September. The snow-covered area on Passu glacier decreased by 24.50%, 3.15% and 11.25% in the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. Similarly, the other three glaciers showed notable decreases in snow-covered area during the pre- and post-monsoon seasons; however, no clear changes were observed during monsoon seasons. During pre-monsoon seasons, the eastward-facing glacier lost comparatively more snow-covered area than the westward-facing glacier. The average seasonal glacier surface temperature calculated from the Landsat thermal band showed negative correlations of -0.67, 0.89, -0.75 and -0.77 with the average seasonal snow-covered areas of the Passu, Momhil, Trivor and Kunyang glaciers, respectively, during pre-monsoon seasons. Similarly, the air temperature collected from a nearby meteorological station showed an increasing trend, indicating that the snow-covered area reduction in the region was largely due to climate warming.","[Gul, Chaman; Kang Shi-chang] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryosphere Sci, Lanzhou 73000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Gul, Chaman; Kang Shi-chang; Muhammad, Sher] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, 19A Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Kang Shi-chang; Muhammad, Sher] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Ghauri, Badar] IST, Karachi, Pakistan; [Haq, Mateeul] Space & Upper Atmosphere Res Commiss SUPARCO, Karachi, Pakistan; [Ali, Shaukat] Minist Climate Change, GCISC, Islamabad, Pakistan",,"Kang, SC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryosphere Sci, Lanzhou 73000, Gansu, Peoples R China.;Kang, SC (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, 19A Yuquan Rd, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Kang, SC (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",chaman@lzb.ac.cn; shichang.kang@lzb.ac.cn; b_ghauri@yahoo.com; matee_haq@yahoo.com; sher_muhammad84@yahoo.com; pirshauki@gmail.com,,,,,,,,10.0,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2017,14.0,10,,,,,2013,2027,,10.1007/s11629-016-4097-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-016-4097-x,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000412313000010,View Full Record in Web of Science

High altitude, extreme climate and frequent military conflicts on this glacier create antagonistic surroundings for conventional field studies. Although recent advancements in geodetic technique have helped in the estimation of Siachen mass budget (MB), these geodetic estimates have been observed only for short time periods ranging 6 to 10 years. Hence, current study presents a comprehensive assessment of the Siachen long-term MB (32 years) based on temperature index (TI) model. Annual surface MB variability was modelled between 1986 and 2018 by forcing daily air temperature and precipitation from multiple ground stations distributed well across accumulation/ablation zone of the glacier. Mean annual temperature lapse rate (LR) was found midway between dry adiabatic and moist adiabatic LRs. Precipitation gradient (PG) was observed remarkably different below and above 4800 m.a.s.l. glacier altitude. Furthermore, snowmelt factor (SMF) was also estimated using snow thickness and positive degree days (PDDs) information over the glacier surface. Model results showed a nearly balanced condition (- 0.02 +/- 0.05 m.w.e./year) during 1986-2006 followed by an accelerated rate of mass loss during 2007-2018 (- 0.11 +/- 0.05 m.w.e./year), thus making the overall condition of Siachen MB negative during the period 1986-2018 (- 0.05 +/- 0.05 m.w.e./year). Comparison of modelled MB was made with few geodetic studies conducted for the Siachen Glacier at different time scales (mainly after year 2000). Further, the sensitivity of the modelled glacier-wide MB was - 0.24 m.w.e./year for a temperature rise by 1 degrees C, while the sensitivity towards 10% increase in precipitation was estimated to be + 0.16 m.w.e./year. A relationship of the annual MB with accumulation area ratio (AAR) and equilibrium line altitude (ELA) was also established for Siachen glacier.","[Kumar, Anant; Negi, H.

All the fruit crops showed a sharp decline in microbial biomass and enzyme activities with the increase in soil depth. Each of the four fruit crops showed significant (p<0.05) impact on MBC over the control and the maximum MBC was recorded in plum (1000 mg kg(-1)) and the lowest value was observed in control (457 mg kg(-1)), at the surface layer. Since there is a relationship between MBC and MBN, the similar trend was also observed in MBN as in case of MBC. For MBP, fruit crops showed any significant effect neither on surface soil, nor on subsurface soil layer over control. At the surface layer, unlike microbial biomass the highest dehydrogenase activity was observed in peach (318 mu g TPF g soil(-1) h(-1)) and the lowest value (166 mu g TPF g soil(-1) h(-1)) was attained at control plot. Maximum alkaline phosphomonoesterase activity was observed in peach (381 mu g PNP g soil(-1) h(-1)), although for acid phosphomonoesterase the highest value recorded in apricot (306 mu g PNP g soil(-1) hr(-1)), at surface soil. A significant positive correlation (p <0.01) was observed amongst MBC, MBN and MBP. Both the phosphomonoesterase activities were significantly (p <0.05) correlated with MBP in soil.

In total, twenty indicator alien species were detected across five different semi-arid ecosystems. Par-thenium hysterophorus recorded from all ecotypes except wetland with highest IVI from agroecosystem. Prosopis juliflora was observed in urban ecosystems, while Stellaria media was in both agroecosystems and forests, and Lantana camara was only observed in forests. Our findings reveal patterns and processes of alien invasive plant in different ecotypes, but only remediation and continuous monitoring might affect the situation in the near future. In this regard, the baseline data gathered during the current study would be significant in guiding future sci-entific monitoring of such ecological changes, as well as in landscape ecology management and planning.","[Waheed, Muhammad; Arshad, Fahim] Univ Okara, Dept Bot, Okara 56300, Pakistan; [Haq, Shiekh Marifatul; Bussmann, Rainer W.] Ilia State Univ, Inst Bot, Dept Ethnobot, GE-0105 Tbilisi, Georgia; [Bussmann, Rainer W.] State Museum Nat Hist, Dept Bot, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Ali, Hayssam M.; Siddiqui, Manzer H.] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",,"Haq, SM (corresponding author), Ilia State Univ, Inst Bot, Dept Ethnobot, GE-0105 Tbilisi, Georgia.;Siddiqui, MH (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.",F19-PhD-Bot-5013@uo.edu.pk; marifat.edu.17@gmail.com; fahim.arahad@uo.edu.pk; Rainer.bussmann@iliauni.edu.ge; hayhassan@ksu.edu.sa; mhsiddiqui@ksu.edu.sa,,,,,,,,9.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,APR,2023,148.0,,,,,,,,110053,10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110053,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110053,,FEB 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000964771300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

All the pine residues were comprised of cellulose (25-30%), hemicellulose (32-37%), and lignin (35-40%). PN-R had the highest lignin content of 40%. FTIR analysis of the pine residues confirmed the presence of functional groups such as C = O, C-N, and O-H on pine residue surface. Elemental analysis showed that O/C for PC-R, PB-R, and PN-R was 0.8, 0.7, and 0.6, respectively. The adsorption capacity (mg/g) and removal efficiency (%) of pine residue adsorbents were evaluated by conducting batch adsorption experiments as determined by response surface methodology (RSM). This was done by varying the pH (2.0-6.0), contact time (0.5-24 h), initial Cu(II) concentration (5-70 mg/1), and S:L (2-8 g/1). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for analyzing the results of batch adsorption experiments. PC-R, PB-R, and PN-R were found to have maximum adsorption capacity of 11.4 mg/g, 10.45 mg/g, and 9.7 mg/g respectively at pH 6.0, S:L of 2 g/L, initial copper concentration of 70 mg/L, and contact time of 6-8 h. The study also revealed that the higher the lignin content in the pine residue is, the lower its adsorption capacity is. Likewise, the higher the 0/C ratio in the pine residue is, the higher its adsorption capacity is. Langmuir isotherm model best fitted the adsorption data for PC-R, PB-R, and PN-R, confirming monolayer adsorption. The present study showed that pseudo-first-order best fitted the copper sorption kinetic data for PC-R, PB-R, and PN-R.","[Tyagi, Shivani; Bashir, Misbah; Mohan, Chander; Annachhatre, Ajit] Indian Inst Technol, Mandi 175005, Himachal Prades, India",,"Annachhatre, A (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Mandi 175005, Himachal Prades, India.",ajit@iitmandi.ac.in,,,,,,,,7.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN,2022,233.0,6,,,,,,,226,10.1007/s11270-022-05624-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05624-7,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000809560700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dominance of Ca in the cation budget indicates its importance in the acid neutralization whereas SO4 and NO3 dominate the anion budget. The major ion concentrations measured in this study are on the lower side of the range reported in the previous study (Rastogi and Sarin, 2007) from the same site. Na and Cl show very good correlation with ratio similar to the seawater ratio, implying their marine origin. Na concentration in these samples has been used as a proxy to calculate the non sea salt fraction of other major ions. Non sea salt Ca and Mg vary from 99.0% to 99.6% and 24.6% to 89.1% of the measured Ca and Mg respectively whereas non sea salt component of SO4 and HCO3 contribute 84.3% to 98.9% and 99.1% to 99.9% respectively. Sr concentrations in these rainwaters vary from 32 to 191 nM and Sr-87/Sr-86 ranges from 0.70878 to 0.71027. Sr concentration shows a very good correlation (coefficient 0.93) with the non-sea salt component of Ca and Mg indicating their continental sources and having similar provenances. Carbonates and basalts seem to contribute significantly to dissolved base cations of the rainwaters. The basalts from Deccan region, which is isotopically indistinguishable from the African basalts and the silicate and carbonates from African region along with the sediments from the Ganga plain (which is originated from the Himalayan lithologies) could be potential dust sources for this particular site. The sources of dissolved base cations deduced from Sr isotope composition of the rainwaters are consistent with wind back trajectory data obtained from NOAA HYSPLIT model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Large variations are seen in BC at both diurnal and seasonal scales, associated with the mesoscale and synoptic meteorological processes, and local/regional anthropogenic activities. BC diurnal variations show two peaks (morning and evening) arising from the combined effects of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics and local emissions. The diurnal amplitudes as well as the rates of diurnal evolution are the highest in winter season, followed by autumn, and the lowest in summer-monsoon. BC exhibits nearly an inverse relation with mixing layer depth in all seasons; being strongest in winter (R-2 = 0.89) and weakest (R-2 = 0.33) in monsoon (July-August). Unlike BC, co-located aerosol optical depths (AOD) and aerosol absorption are highest in spring over IGP, probably due to the presence of higher abundances of aerosols (including dust) above the ABL (in the free troposphere). AOD (500 nm) showed annual peak (>0.6) in May-June, dominated by coarse mode, while fine mode aerosols dominated in late autumn and early winter. Aerosols profiles from CALIPSO show highest values close to the surface in winter/autumn, similar to the feature seen in surface BC, whereas at altitudes > 2 km, the extinction is maximum in spring/summer. WRF-Chem model is used to simulate BC temporal variations and then compared with observed BC. The model captures most of the important features of the diurnal and seasonal variations but significantly underestimated the observed BC levels, suggesting improvements in diurnal and seasonal varying BC emissions apart from the boundary layer processes.

The average ratios of NO3- + Cl-/SO42- were 1.08 and 1.64 for Mohal and Kothi, respectively; indicating that a small fraction of HNO3 and HCl influenced the acidic nature of ions. The mass ratios of NH4+/NO3- and NH4+/SO42- were 0.29, 0.5 and 0.15, 0.28; at Mohal and Kothi, respectively. The ratios were below unity showing the predominance of NH4NO3 and (NH4)(2)SO4 in the atmosphere. The descending order of neutralizing factors were observed as Ca2+ > NH4+ > K+ > Mg2+ assuming that the origin is of a crustal source. The non-sea salt fraction for Mohal was found in the descending order of Cl-, Ca2+ and SO42- , which are more than 50% of the total ions except Mg2+ and K+. While for Kothi, the percentage of Cl- and SO42- stood to be more than 50% indicating that these ions are of non-marine origin.

The annual and seasonal variation in the snow cover area (SCA) due to its response to the climatic variables directly influences the water supplies. The aim of current study is to evaluate the spatio-temporal trends in the annual and seasonal snow cover at basin-wide scale. Impact of topography on the SCA is analyzed by revealing the trends in SCA in different elevation bands. It also investigates the trends in hydro-climatic factors (temperature, precipitation and river flows) in the Chitral River basin (Hindukush region) and their linkage to the SCA variations. Snow cover is estimated using cloud-free 8-day MODIS snow products on 17-year time-period (2000-2016). Hydro-climatic data of the river flow (1989-2014), temperature, and precipitation (1965-2013) were obtained from Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), and Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Trend analysis of the SCA and hydro-climatic variables was carried out using Mann-Kendall's trend test and Sen's slope. The results reveal: (1) a significant increasing trend in the SCA at basin-wide scale and at all elevation zones i.e. A to E (1471-7708 m ASL), except zone B (2500-3500 m ASL), (2) decreasing and constant trends in the mean temperature and total precipitation, respectively, over the same time-period as SCA indicating possible reasons for increasing SCA, (3) a slight decrease in the mean annual and summer flow (1989-2014) possibly due to the summer cooling, reduced snowmelt and slightly decreasing summer precipitation over this time-period, and (4) strong dependency of the Chitral River flow on snowmelt, driven by the temperature seasonality. Modeling snowmelt runoff under future climate projections in the study area may help to manage the water resources properly.","[Ahmad, Shakeel; Hayat, Huma; Gul, Jawaria; Wajid, Sara; Tahir, Adnan Ahmad] COMSATS Univ Islamabad CUI, Dept Environm Sci, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad, Pakistan; [Ahmad, Shakeel] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Israr, Muhammad] Univ Agr, Fac Rural Social Sci AMKC, Dept Rural Dev, Peshawar, Pakistan; [Liu, Shiyin] Yunnan Univ, Inst Int Rivers & Ecosecur, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Ashraf, Muhammad] Univ Punjab, Coll Informat & Technol PUCIT, Hydrol & Water Resources, GIS Ctr, Lahore, Pakistan; [Baig, Siddique Ullah] COMSATS Univ Islamabad CUI, High Mt Res Ctr, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad, Pakistan",,"Tahir, AA (corresponding author), COMSATS Univ Islamabad CUI, Dept Environm Sci, Abbottabad Campus, Abbottabad, Pakistan.",uaf_adnan@hotmail.fr,,,,,,,,24.0,25.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAY 18,2020,35.0,7,,,,,711,734,,10.1080/10106049.2018.1524517,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2018.1524517,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000530941100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

AEs are defined as the days having daily-mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) above the decadal mean + 1 STD (standard deviation); the threshold value is defined at 0.93. The analysis identifies 277 out of 2095 days (13.2%) of AEs over Kanpur, which are most frequently observed during post-monsoon (78 cases, 18.6%) and monsoon (76, 14.7%) seasons due to biomass-burning episodes and dust influence, respectively. On the other hand, the AEs during winter and pre-monsoon are lesser in both absolute and percentage values (65, 12.5% and 58, 9.1%, respectively). The modification in aerosol properties on the AE days is strongly dependent on season; during post-monsoon and winter, the AEs are associated with enhanced presence of fine-mode aerosols from anthropogenic emissions and/or biomass burning, while during pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons, they are mostly associated with dust. Aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) calculated using SBDART shows much more surface (similar to-69 to-97 Wm(-2)) and Top of Atmosphere cooling (-20 to 30 Wm(-2)) as well as atmospheric heating (similar to 43 to 71 Wm(-2)) during the AE days as compared to seasonal means. These forcing values are mainly controlled by the higher AODs and the modified aerosol characteristics (Angstrom Exponent a, single scattering albedo SSA) during the AE days in each season. Furthermore, the vertical profiles of aerosols and atmospheric radiative heating exhibit significant increase in lower and mid troposphere during the AE days. This may cause serious climate implications over Ganges Basin and surrounding regions with further consequences on cloud microphysics, monsoon rainfall and melting of Himalayan glaciers.

We used a random sampling technique from 80 grids within 240 sites with a rich diversity of wild grasses and 720 quadrates in triplets from each site across the Jhelum district between 2019 and 2021 to collect data on grass species and the associated environmental factors and conditions. After evaluating the important value index for each plant taxa and for the environmental data, we analyzed the data using ordination and cluster analysis techniques. Fifty-two Poaceae taxa from twenty-nine genera were recorded within the study area. From a total of 52 recorded Poaceae species, 45 were native and 7 were invasive species. The life form (biological) showed the dominancy of 27 therophyte species, followed by 24 hemicryptophyte species, and 1 geophyte species. Microphyll had the leading leaf size spectra (27 species), followed by nanophyll (12 species), macrophyll (10 species), and leptophyll (3 species). The trend of the life cycle was the maximum (27 spp.) during the monsoon season, followed by spring (11 spp.), winter (8 spp.), and summer (6 spp.). The leading genera were Setaria with 9.61% of the species, followed by Panicum, Cenchrus, and Brachiaria with 7.69% of the species. Aristida and Echinochloa made up 5.76% of the species while Chrysopogon, Digitaria, Eragrostis, Pennisetum, and Poa made up 3.84% of the species. Other genera recorded single species. The leaf size spectra of grasses were dominated by microphylls (50%) followed by nanophylls (23.07%), macrophylls (19.23%), and leptophylls (7.69%). On the basis of the importance value index, the most dominant species was Cynodon dactylon (68), followed by Dichanthium annulatum (58), Brachiaria ramose (38), Dactyloctenium aegyptium (37), Eleusine indica (35), Saccharum bengalense (33), and Cenchrus biflorus (28). Two-way cluster analyses classified the grasses into three plant community associations based on the indicator plant species. Soil parameters as subsamples were tested for moisture, pH, EC, OM, macronutrients (CaCO3, N, P, and K), and saturation while the ordination analysis revealed that they had a significant (p <= 0.002) effect on vegetation associations. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the influence of environmental factors on the composition and associations of grass species and the development of scientifically informed management solutions for the ecological restoration of degraded habitats in this Himalayan region.","[Majeed, Muhammad] Univ Gujrat, Dept Bot, Hafiz Hayat Campus, Gujrat 50700, Punjab, Pakistan; [Tariq, Aqil] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Haq, Sheikh Marifatul] Univ Kashmir, Dept Bot, Srinagar 190006, India; [Waheed, Muhammad] Univ Okara, Dept Bot, Renala Khurd 56130, Punjab, Pakistan; [Anwar, Muhammad Mushahid] Univ Gujrat, Dept Geog, Hafiz Hayat Campus, Gujrat 50700, Punjab, Pakistan; [Li, Qingting] Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Airborne Remote Sensing Ctr, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Aslam, Muhammad] Univ West Scotland, Sch Comp Engn & Phys Sci, Paisley G72 0LH, Renfrew, Scotland; [Abbasi, Sanaullah] Shah Abdul Latif Univ, Dept Biochem, Khairpur 66020, Sindh, Pakistan; [Mousa, B.

Being ecologically sensitive and sparsely studied for dynamics in PM2.5 and associated WSIS, the present study is important for developing robust air pollution abatement strategies for the air-shed of NWHR. Twenty-four hourly PM2.5 samples were collected on weekly basis at a receptor site and analyzed for WSIS using ion chromatography system. On annual basis, total sum of WSIS (sigma WSIS) contributed about 28.5% of PM2.5, where the contribution of sulfate-nitrate-ammonium, a proxy for secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA), was found to be 18.7% of PM2.5. The sigma WSIS and PM2.5 concentration showed a seasonal cycle with the maximum concentration during winters and the minimum in summers. Mass fraction of sigma WSIS in PM2.5 showed an anti-phase seasonal pattern indicating more source activity during summers. Season-wise, dominant WSIS constituting PM2.5 were NO3-, SO42-, NH4+, and K+ during winters; whereas summer was marked with dominant contributions from SO42-, NH4+, Ca2+, and K+. Seasonal variability exhibited among SIA constituents underscored the crucial role of air temperature and relative humidity regime. It was observed that nss-K+ + NH4+ were sufficient to neutralize most of the acidic species arising from precursor gases (NOx and SOx).

PM10 samples are analysed for carbonaceous aerosols (Organic Carbon, OC and EC) and water-soluble ionic species (WSIS: Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, PO42- NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) and several diagnostic ratios (OC/EC, K+/EC, etc) have been also used for studying the aerosol sources at Varanasi. PM10 mass concentration varies between 53 and 310 mu m(-3)(mean of 168 73 mu g m(-3)), which is much higher than the National and International air quality standards. The OC mass concentration varies from 6 mu g m(-3) to 24 mu g m(-3) (mean of 12 +/- 5 mu g m(-3); 7% of PM10 mass), whereas EC ranges between 1.0 and 14.3 mu g m(-3) (4.4 +/- 3.9 rig m(-3); similar to 3% of PM()mass). The relative low OC/EC of 3.9 +/- 2.0 and strong correlation (R-2 = 0.82) between them suggest the dominance of primary carbonaceous aerosols. The contribution of WSIS to PM10 is found to be similar to 12%, out of which similar to 57% and 43% are anions and cations, respectively. The composite DARE estimates via SBDART model reveal significant radiative effect and atmospheric heating rates (0.9-2.3 K day(-1)). Although the EC contributes only similar to 3% to the PM10 mass, its contribution to the surface and atmospheric forcing is significantly high (37-63% and 54-77%, respectively), thus playing a major role in climate implications over Varanasi.

Terrestrial laser scanners, a non-contact measuring system, can measure the velocity of a glacier even if there are no control points arranged on a glacier. In this study, six COSMO-SkyMed images acquired between 31 July and 22 December 2016 were used to obtain the glacial movements of five glaciers on the northern slope of the central Himalayas using the offset tracking approach. During the period of image acquirement, a terrestrial laser scanner was used, and point clouds of two periods in a small area at the terminus of the Pingcuoliesa Glacier were obtained. By selecting three fixed areas of the point clouds that have similar shapes across two periods, the displacements of the centers of gravity of the selected areas were calculated by using contrast analyses of feature points. Although the overall low-density point clouds data indicate that the glacial surfaces have low albedos relative to the wavelength of the terrestrial laser scanner and the effect of its application is therefore influenced in this research, the registration accuracy of 0.0023 m/d in the non-glacial areas of the scanner's measurements is acceptable, considering the magnitude of 0.072 m/d of the minimum glacial velocity measured by the scanner. The displacements from the point clouds broadly agree with the results of the offset tracking technique in the same area, which provides further evidence of the reliability of the measurements of the SAR data in addition to the analyses of the root mean squared error of the velocity residuals in non-glacial areas. The analysis of the movement of five glaciers in the study area revealed the dynamic behavior of these glacial surfaces across five periods. G089972E28213N Glacier, Pingcuoliesa Glacier and Shimo Glacier show increasing surface movement velocities from the terminus end to the upper part with elevations of 1500 m, 4500 m, and 6400 m, respectively. The maximum velocities on the glacial surface profiles were 31.69 cm/d, 62.40 cm/d, and 42.00 cm/d, respectively. In contrast, the maximum velocity of Shie Glacier, 50.60 cm/d, was observed at the glacier's terminus. For each period, G090138E28210N Glacier exhibited similar velocity values across the surface profile, with a maximum velocity of 39.70 cm/d. The maximum velocities of G089972E28213N Glacier, Pingcuoliesa Glacier, and Shie Glacier occur in the areas where the topography is steepest. In general, glacial surface velocities are higher in the summer than in the winter in this region. With the assistance of a terrestrial laser scanner with optimized wavelengths or other proper ground-based remote sensing instruments, the offset tracking technique based on high-resolution satellite SAR data should provide more reliable and detailed information for local and even single glacial surface displacement monitoring.","[Fan, Jinghui; Guo, Zhaocheng; Tong, Liqiang; Yuan, Weilin] China Aero Geophys Survey, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Fan, Jinghui; Guo, Zhaocheng; Tong, Liqiang; Yuan, Weilin] Remote Sensing Ctr Nat Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qun] CHECC Data Co Ltd, China Highway Engn Consultants Corp, Res & Dev Ctr Transport Ind Spatial Informat Appl, Beijing 100097, Peoples R China; [Liu, Guang; Zhang, Lu; Yan, Jin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Peng, Junhuan; Zhou, Wei] China Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Perski, Zbigniew] Natl Res Inst, Polish Geol Inst, Carpathian Branch, PL-31560 Krakow, Poland; [Sousa, Joaquim Joao] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Sch Sci & Technol, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal; [Sousa, Joaquim Joao] INESC TEC, P-5000801 Vila Real, Portugal",,"Liu, G; Zhang, L (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Key Lab Digital Earth Sci, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China.",jh15fan@agrs.cn; 2012160034@cugb.edu.cn; liuguang@radi.ac.cn; zhanglu@radi.ac.cn; guozc@agrs.cn; tongliqiang@mail.cgs.gov.cn; 2006012076@cugb.edu.cn; yuanweilin@mail.cgs.gov.cn; zhouw@cugb.edu.cn; zhenjn@radi.ac.cn; zper@pgi.gov.pl; jjsousa@utad.pt,,,,,,,,14.0,15.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2,2019,11.0,6,,,,,,,625,10.3390/rs11060625,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11060625,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000465615300024,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a source of major rivers in Asia, this region provides fresh water to more than one billion people. Any terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes there have major societal effects in large parts of the continent. Due to the recent acceleration in global warming, part of the water environment in TP has become drastically unbalanced, with an increased risk of water disasters. We quantified secular and monthly glacier-mass-balance and TWS changes in water basins from April 2002 to December 2021 through the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment and its Follow-on satellite mission (GRACE/GRACE-FO). Adequate data postprocessing with destriping filters and gap filling and two regularization methods implemented in the spectral and space domain were applied. The largest glacier-mass losses were found in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains and Eastern Himalayas, with rates of -4.92 & PLUSMN; 1.38 Gt a(-1) and -4.34 & PLUSMN; 1.48 Gt a(-1), respectively. The Tien Shan region showed strong losses in its eastern and central parts. Furthermore, we found small glacier-mass increases in the Karakoram and West Kunlun. Most of the glacier mass change can be explained by snowfall changes and, in some areas, by summer rainfall created by the Indian monsoon. Major water basins in the north and south of the TP exhibited partly significant negative TWS changes. In turn, the endorheic region and the Qaidam basin in the TP, as well as the near Three Rivers source region, showed distinctly positive TWS signals related to net precipitation increase. However, the Salween River source region and the Yarlung Zangbo River basin showed decreasing trends. We suggest that our new and improved TWS-change results can be used for the maintenance of water resources and the prevention of water disasters not only in the TP, but also in surrounding Asian countries. They may also help in global change studies.","[Xiang, Longwei; Su, Zhenfeng; Wang, Wenliang; Deng, Fan; Cui, Haifu] Yangtze Univ, Sch Geosci, Wuhan 430100, Peoples R China; [Xiang, Longwei; Wang, Hansheng; Jiang, Liming; Shen, Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Geodesy & Earths Dynam, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China; [Wang, Hansheng; Jiang, Liming; Shen, Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Earth & Planetary Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Steffen, Holger] Lantmateriet, Geodet Infrastruct, S-80182 Gavle, Sweden; [Jia, Lulu] China Earthquake Adm, Inst Geophys, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Qiao, Baojin] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Geosci & Technol, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China; [Gao, Peng] Linyi Univ, Sch Resources & Environm, Linyi 276000, Peoples R China",,"Xiang, LW (corresponding author), Yangtze Univ, Sch Geosci, Wuhan 430100, Peoples R China.;Xiang, LW (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Geodesy & Earths Dynam, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R China.",lwxiang@yangtzeu.edu.cn; whs@whigg.ac.cn; holger.steffen@lm.se; jlm@whigg.ac.cn; cl980606@whigg.ac.cn; jalulu@cea-igp.ac.cn; dengfan@yangtzeu.edu.cn; qiaobaojin@zzu.edu.cn; cuihaifu@yangtzeu.edu.cn; gaopeng@lyu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2023,15.0,14,,,,,,,3505,10.3390/rs15143505,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15143505,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001036423600001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Ghuffar, S",,,,"Ghuffar, Sajid",,,DEM Generation from Multi Satellite PlanetScope Imagery,REMOTE SENSING,,,,Article,,,,,,,,"Planet Labs have recently launched a large constellation of small satellites (3U cubesats) capable of imaging the whole Earth landmass everyday. These small satellites capture multiple images of an area on consecutive days or sometimes on the same day with a spatial resolution of 3-4 m. Planet Labs endeavors to operate the constellation in a nadir pointing mode, however, the view angle of these satellites currently varies within a few degrees from the nadir leading to varying B/H ratio for overlapping image pairs. Due to relatively small scene footprint and small off-nadir angle, the baseline to height ratio (B/H) of the overlapping PlanetScope images is often less than 1:10, which is not ideal for 3D reconstruction. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of Digital Elevation Model generation from this multi-date, multi-satellite PlanetScope imagery. The DEM generation from multiple PlanetScope images is achieved using a volumetric stereo reconstruction technique, which applies semi global matching in georeferenced object space. The results are evaluated using a LiDAR based DEM (5 m) over Mount Teide (3718 m) in Canary Islands and the ALOS (30 m) DEM on rugged terrain of the Nanga Parbat massif (8126 m) in the western Himalaya range. The proposed methodology is then applied on images from two PlanetScope satellites overpasses within a couple of minutes difference to compute the DEM of the Khurdopin glacier in the Karakoram range, known for its recent surge. The quantitative assessment of the generated elevation models is done by comparing statistics of the elevation differences between the reference LiDAR and ALOS DEM and the PlanetScope DEM. The Normalized Median of Absolute Deviation (NMAD) of the elevation differences between the computed PlanetScope DEM and LiDAR DEM is 4.1 m and the elevation differences for the ALOS DEM over stable terrain is 3.9 m. The results show that PlanetScope imagery can lead to sufficient quality DEM even with a small baseline to height ratio. Therefore, the daily PlanetScope imagery is a valuable data source and the DEM generated from this imagery can potentially be employed in numerous applications requiring multi temporal DEMs.","[Ghuffar, Sajid] Inst Space Technol, Dept Space Sci, Geospatial Res & Educ Lab, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan",,"Ghuffar, S (corresponding author), Inst Space Technol, Dept Space Sci, Geospatial Res & Educ Lab, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.",sajid.ghuffar@grel.ist.edu.pk,,,,,,,,39.0,39.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2018,10.0,9,,,,,,,1462,10.3390/rs10091462,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs10091462,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000449993800142,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study we investigated trace element deposition in the snowpacks at two different locations in the northern Tibetan Plateau, including the Laohugou (LHG) and the Tanggula (TGL) glacier basins, and its related atmospheric pollution information in these glacier areas, mainly focusing on 18 trace elements (Li, Be, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Rb, Nb, Mo, Cd, Sb, Cs, Ba, Tl, and Pb). The results clearly demonstrate that pronounced increases of both concentrations and crustal enrichment factors (EFs) are observed in the snowpack at the TGL glacier basin compared to that of the LHG glacier basin, with the highest EFs for Sb and Zn in the TGL basin, whereas with the highest EFs for Sb and Cd in the LHG basin. Compared with other studies in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions, trace element concentration showed gradually decreasing trend from Himalayan regions (southern Tibetan Plateau) to the TGL basin (central Tibetan Plateau), and to the LHG basin (northern Tibetan Plateau), which probably implied the significant influence of atmospheric trace element transport from south Asia to the central Tibetan Plateau. Moreover, EF calculations at two sites showed that most of the heavy metals (e.g., Cu, Zn, Mo, Cd, Sb, and Pb) were from anthropogenic sources and some other elements (e.g., Li, Rb, and Ba) were mainly originated from crustal sources. MODIS atmospheric optical depth (AOD) fields derived using the Deep Blue algorithm and CALIOP/CALIPSO transect showed significant influence of atmospheric pollutant transport from south Asia to the Tibetan Plateau, which probably caused the increased concentrations and EFs of trace element deposition in the snowpack on the TGL glacier basin.

The frequent presence of cloudy conditions severely complicates the discrimination of snow cover from satellite imagery. To accurately monitor the spatiotemporal evolution of snow cover, it is imperative to address these challenges and enhance the segmentation schemes employed for snow cover assessment. In this study, we devised a pixel-wise classification algorithm based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) called the 3-D Orientation Gradient algorithm (3-D OG), which captures the variations of the gradient direction of snow and clouds in spatiotemporal dimensions based on geostationary satellite Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) multi-spectral and multi-temporal optical imagery. This algorithm assumes that the speed and direction of clouds and snow are different in the process of movement leading to their discrepancy of gradient characteristics in time and space. Therefore, in this algorithm, the gradient of the images in the spatiotemporal dimensions is calculated first, and then the movement angle and trend are obtained based on that. Finally, the feature space is composed of the multi-spectral image, gradient image, and movement feature maps, which are used as the input of the SVM. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can identify snow and clouds more accurately during snowfall by utilizing the FY-4A's high temporal resolution image. Weather station data, which was collected during snowstorms in the QTP, were used for evaluating the accuracy of our algorithm. It is demonstrated that the overall accuracy of snow cover segmentation by using the 3-D OG algorithm is improved by at least 12% and 10% as compared to snow products of Fengyun-2 and MODIS, respectively. Overall, the proposed algorithm has overcome the axial swing errors existing in Geostationary satellites and is successfully applied to cloud and snow segmentation in QTP. Furthermore, our study underscores that the visible and near-infrared bands of Fengyun-4A can be used for near real-time snow cover monitoring with high performance using the 3-D OG algorithm.","[Ma, Guangyi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci Technol, Sch Elect & Informat Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Linglong] Wuxi Univ, Sch Internet Things Engn, Wuxi 214105, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yonghong] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Automat, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Sian, Kenny Thiam Choy Lim Kam] Wuxi Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci & Remote Sensing, Wuxi 214105, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yixin] Anhui Meteorol Informat Ctr, Hefei 230031, Peoples R China; [Yu, Tianming] Tiantai Meteorol Bur, Taizhou 317200, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, YH (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Automat, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",gyma@nuist.edu.cn; llzhu@cwxu.edu.cn; zyh@nuist.edu.cn; kennylimks@cwxu.edu.cn; 18752012969@163.com; tianming9313@163.com,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2023,15.0,19,,,,,,,3329,10.3390/w15193329,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15193329,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:001081603300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet the likelihood of successive observed droughts in South Asia (SA) and its four subregions (R-1: semi-arid, R-2: arid, R-3: subtropical wet, and R-4: tropical wet and dry) remains poorly understood. Using the state-of-the-art self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI), we examined the impact of different natural ocean variability modes on the evolution, severity, and magnitude of observed droughts across the four subregions that have distinct precipitation seasonality and cover key breadbaskets and highly vulnerable populations. The study revealed that dryness had significantly increased in R-1, R-2, and R-4 during 1981-2020. Temporal analysis revealed an increase in drought intensity for R-1 and R-4 since the 2000s, while a mixed behavior was observed in R-2 and R-3. Moreover, most of the sub-regions witnessed a substantial upsurge in annual precipitation, but a significant decrease in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during 1981-2020. The increase in precipitation and the decline in VPD partially contributed to a significant rise in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a decrease in dryness. In contrast, a strong positive correlation was found between drought index and precipitation, and NDVI across R-1, R-2, and R-4, whereas temperature and VPD exhibited a negative correlation over these regions. No obvious link was detected with El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, or Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and drought evolution, as explored for certain regions of SA. The findings showed the possibility that the precipitation changes over these regions had an insignificant relationship with ENSO, IOD, and drought onset. Thus, the study results highlight the need for considering interactions within the longer climate system in describing observed drought risks rather than aiming at drivers from an individual perspective.","[Ullah, Irfan] Hohai Univ, Coll Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Ullah, Irfan] Hohai Univ, CMA HHU Joint Lab Hydrometeorol Studies, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xieyao; Yin, Jun; Lu, Kaidong; Xing, Yun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Water Resources, Key Lab Hydrometeorol Disaster Mech & Warning, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xieyao; Yin, Jun; Lu, Kaidong; Xing, Yun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Ren, Guoyu] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Res, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan 340074, Peoples R China; [Iyakaremye, Vedaste] Rwanda Meteorol Agcy, POB 898, Kigali, Rwanda; [Syed, Sidra] Univ Peshawar, Inst Peace & Conflicts Studies, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Biol & Agr Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Singh, Vijay P.] Texas A&M Univ, Zachry Dept Civil Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",,"Ma, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Minist Water Resources, Key Lab Hydrometeorol Disaster Mech & Warning, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Ma, XY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Hydrol & Water Resources, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",irfan.marwat@nuist.edu.cn; xyma@nuist.edu.cn; gyren@cug.edu.cn; jun.yin@nuist.edu.cn; 20195101007@nuist.edu.cn; sid.syed92@yahoo.com; lukaidong@nuist.edu.cn; yxing@nuist.edu.cn; vsingh@tamu.edu,,,,,,,,14.0,14.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2022,14.0,13,,,,,,,3219,10.3390/rs14133219,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14133219,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000823926300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The maize-French bean system had also the highest net profit (US$ 3764.5 ha(-1)) and benefit to cost ratio (2.54). The energy consumed under different inputs/activities across the cropping systems for chemical fertilizers, diesel and machinery ranged from 50.0-62.7%, 17.3-20.8% and 4.6-15.4%, respectively. The maize-fallow system had the highest CF (0.34 kg CO2 e per kg grain) while, themaize-French bean system had the lowest CF (0.19 kg CO2 e per kg grain). The maize-French bean system had also considerably increased eco-efficiency both in terms of energy use (US$ 0.23 MJ(-1)) and (US$ 1.78 per kg CO2 e) over maize-fallow system. Thus, the study has suggested that maizeFrench bean system is energy-efficient, economically viable and environmentally safer systems to utilize maize fallow and improve food security, may help in achieving green/circular economy.

Early loss of seasonal snow exposes the ice layer of the glaciers directly to sunlight, consequently leading to their ablation and alterations in discharge of glacier-fed rivers. Therefore, any alteration in the melting rate of the Himalayan snow pack can significantly affect the ecological balance in the region. Besides global warming, enhanced melting of snow, caused by light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) such as dust and elemental carbon (EC), has also been recognized as prominent cause of enhanced melting of snow in the Himalayas of China and Nepal. However, in light of vast area of the Himalayas and persistent emissions from India, studies, emphasizing the potential of LAIs to substantially affect the snow radiation budget of snow cover in IWHs, are still scanty. Therefore, in this study, field campaigns were made on three glaciers, i.e., Hamta, Beas Kund, and Deo Tibba, in IWHs to collect snow samples for estimation of LAIs. Snow of the studied glaciers was observed to be contaminated with 13.02 to 74.57ng/g of EC and 32.14 to 216.54g/g of dust. Albedo simulations done using SNow and ICe Aerosol Radiation (SNICAR) model indicated that besides the changes caused by increased grain size, EC and dust, cumulatively induced 0.60 to 32.65% reduction in albedo of snow. Further assessment, constrained by measurements, illustrated that radiative forcing (RF), of 1.8 to 80W/m(2), was instigated due to enhanced thermal absorption of snow. Ten hours of daily mean RFs in this range could correspond to 3 to 9.65mm/d of snow melt and contribute significantly in reducing the seasonal snow cover in IWHs. Considering the consequences of LAIs-induced snow melt and lack of in situ observations in the IWHs, the outcomes of this study could assist researchers and policy makers in developing efficient climate models and framing mitigation measures, respectively.","[Thind, Parteek Singh; Chandel, Kamal Kumar; John, Siby] Punjab Engn Coll, Chandigarh 160012, India; [Sharma, Sudhir Kumar; Mandal, Tuhin Kumar] CSIR, Natl Phys Lab, Environm Sci & Biomed Metrol Div, Dr KS Krishnan Rd, New Delhi 110012, India",,"John, S (corresponding author), Punjab Engn Coll, Chandigarh 160012, India.",johnsiby1@gmail.com,,,,,,,,26.0,28.0,,,,,,,,,,,MAR,2019,26.0,8,,,,,7566,7578,,10.1007/s11356-019-04183-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-04183-5,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000463824600023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Ca2+ and HCO3- are the predominant ions in river water. The extremely low K+ and NO3- concentrations and the sparse population suggest that the anthropogenic inputs are limited. The Pearson correlation coefficients and the elemental ratios Ca2+/Na+ versus Mg2+/Na+, Ca2+/Na versus HCO3-/Na+, [Ca2+ + Mg2+]/[HCO3-] versus [SO42-]/[HCO3-] reveal the mixing processes of different sources; the chemical composition of the river water is controlled by the mixture of carbonate weathering, evaporite weathering and silicate weathering inputs. To quantify the contributions of atmospheric input and rock dissolution, the forward method is employed in this study, which is based on the mass balance equation. The calculation results suggest the carbonate weathering inputs and gypsum dissolution make up the majority of the riverine cations, while silicate weathering and halite dissolution constitutes a relatively small proportion, the contributions of the atmospheric input are limited. The fast dissolution rate of evaporite and carbonate minerals and their lithologic distributions should be the key factor. To evaluate the water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes, the drinking water quality guidelines and the calculated parameters were employed, including sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), soluble sodium percentage (Na%,) and residual sodium carbonate (RSC). The assessments indicate that the river waters in the middle-lower reaches are generally suitable for irrigation and drinking purpose, and will not lead to health and soil problems, such as soil compaction and salinization. While in the upper reaches, the dissolution of carbonate and gypsum minerals transport abundant ions into river water and the river waters are not appropriate to use directly. This result highlights that the water quality status can also be affected by natural weathering processes in the area without anthropogenic inputs, where the long-time monitoring of water quality is also necessary.","[Liu, Jinke; Han, Guilin; Liu, Man; Zeng, Jie; Liang, Bin; Qu, Rui] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Inst Earth Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",,"Han, GL (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Beijing, Inst Earth Sci, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",Liujinke@cugb.edu.cn; hanguilin@cugb.edu.cn; lman@cugb.edu.cn; zengjie@cugb.edu.cn; liangbin@cugb.edu.cn; Qurui@cugb.edu.cn,,,,,,,,14.0,16.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC,2019,16.0,23,,,,,,,4670,10.3390/ijerph16234670,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16234670,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000507275700015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The sampling location were characterized by four different categories, such as urban (Bode), semiurban site in the northern Indo-Gangetic Plain (Lumbini), rural (Dhunche), and semiarid rural (Jomsom). A total of 230 aerosol samples were collected from four representative sites for a yearlong period and analyzed for water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs). The annual average aerosol mass concentration followed the sequence as Bode (238.24 +/- 162.24 mu g/m(3))> Lumbini (161.14 +/- 105.95 mu g/m(3))> Dhunche (112.40 +/- 40.30 mu g/m(3))> Jomsom (78.85 +/- 34.28 mu g/m(3)), suggesting heavier particulate pollution in the urban and semi-urban sites. The total soluble ions contributed to 12.61-28.19% of TSP aerosol mass. The results revealed that SO42- and NO3- were the major anion and Ca2+ and NH4+ were the major cation influencing the aerosol composition over the central Himalayas. Calcium played a major role in neutralizing aerosol acidity followed by NH4+ at all the sites. The major compound of aerosol was (NH4)(2)SO4 and NH4HSO4 in the central Himalayas. Clear seasonality was observed at three observation sites, with higher concentrations during non-monsoon (dry periods) and lower during monsoon (wet period), suggesting washing out of aerosol particles by heavy precipitation during monsoon. In contrast, semiarid sites did not show the clear seasonal trend due to limited precipitation. Stationary sources were predominant over the mobile sources mostly in the remote sites. Principal component analysis confirmed that the major sources of WSIIs in the region were industrial emissions, fossil fuel and biomass burning, and crustal fugitive dusts. Nevertheless, transboundary aerosol transport over the region from polluted cities from south Asia could not be ignored as indicated by the clusters of air mass backward trajectory analysis.","[Tripathee, Lekhendra; Kang, Shichang] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Tripathee, Lekhendra] Himalayan Environm Res Inst HERI, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Kang, Shichang; Cong, Zhiyuan; Zhang, Qianggong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Rupakheti, Dipesh; Cong, Zhiyuan; Zhang, Qianggong; Huang, Jie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China",,"Tripathee, L; Kang, SC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.",lekhendra.t@gmail.com; shichang.kang@lzb.ac.cn,,,,,,,,57.0,59.0,,,,,,,,,,,NOV,2017,24.0,31,,,,,24454,24472,,10.1007/s11356-017-0077-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0077-0,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000413649700036,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dalweed (weeds from the world-famous urban Dal Lake) and cow manure (CM) are cheaply and abundantly available bio resources in Kashmir valley. Dalweed (DW), disposed of in the heart of the city, ascribes unpleasant effects on tourism and the natural ecosystem. Initial substrate mixtures of DW and CM with different ratios (CM100, DW100, CM80:DW20, CM60:DW40, CM40:DW60 and CM20:DW80) and castings harvested were analyzed for the following parameters: pH, TOC, TN, NO3- P, K, Fe, Zn, C:N, C:P, and C:S ratio. The results of a 56day study revealed in consistency and disparity towards the bio-optimization of coprolites depending upon the type of waste residue and mixture ratio used. Treatments with medium to low dalweed residues (CM60:DW40 followed by CM80:DW20) were found to be optimum and significantly primed chemical properties of castings using A. caligenosa. C:N, C:P, and C:S ratios showed a non-linear response with maximum decrease in C:N ratio by 35%, C:P ratio by 38% in CM100, and C:S ratio by 67% in DW100.

Results also showed that the earthworm population and biomass significantly increased with the highest respective increments of 57.53% and 74.88% in CM60:DW40 over initial values. Moreover, the highest number of cocoons (95.67 +/- 1.17) were recorded within CM60:DW40 and the lowest in the control (43.33 +/- 1.53). Dehydrogenase and fluorescein diacetate activities were inconsistent with the highest in CM40:DW60 (64.64%) and CM20:DW80 (63.54%) respectively over the initial substrates, while highest urease activity (74.40%) was observed from CM100.

Spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements were performed using the CIMEL CE-318 automatic Sun/sky radiometer. The annual-averaged AOD(500) and angstrom ngstrom exponent (alpha(440-870)) values are found to be 0.43 +/- 0.26 and 0.69 +/- 0.39, respectively. On the seasonal basis, high AOD(500) of 0.45 +/- 0.30 and 0.61 +/- 0.34 along with low alpha(440-870) of 0.41 +/- 0.27 and 0.41 +/- 0.35 during spring (March-May) and summer (June-August), respectively, suggest the dominance of coarse-mode aerosols, while significant contribution from anthropogenic sources is observed in autumn (AOD(500)= 0.47 +/- 0.26, alpha(440-870)= 1.02 +/- 0.27). The volume size distribution and the spectral single-scattering albedo also confirm the presence of coarse-mode aerosols during March-August. An overall dominance of a mixed type of aerosols (similar to 56%) mostly from October to February is found via the AOD(500) vs alpha(440-870) relationship, while marine aerosols contribute to similar to 18%. Spectral dependence of a and its second derivative (alpha') are also used for studying the aerosol modification processes. The average direct aerosol radiative forcing (DARF) computed via the SBDART model is estimated to range from -27.08 W m(-2) to -10.74 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere, from -52.21Wm(-2) to -21.71Wm(-2) at the surface and from 10.97W m(-2) to 26.54 Wm(-2) within the atmosphere. This atmospheric forcing translates into heating rates of 0.31 - 0.75 K day(-1).

An understanding of tree species and forest structural pattern variations across different climatic regions is crucial for mountain ecology. This study strived to carry out a comparative evaluation of species diversity, main stand variables, and canopy cover of forests with contrasting precipitation conditions in the Annapurna range. Firstly, climate data provided by CHELSA version 1.2, were used to identify distinct precipitation regimes. Lamjung and Mustang were selected as two contrasting precipitation regions, and have average annual precipitation of 2965 mm and 723 mm, respectively. Stratified random sampling was used to study 16 plots, each measuring 500 m(2) and near the tree line at an elevation range of 3000 to 4000 m across different precipitation conditions. In total, 870 trees were identified and measured. Five hemispherical photos using a fisheye lens were taken in each plot for recording and analyzing canopy cover. Margalef's index was used to measure species richness, while two diversity indices: the Shannon-Wiener Index and Simpson Index were used for species diversity. Dominant tree species in both study regions were identified through the Important Value Index (IVI). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed to determine the differences in forest structure and composition variables between the two precipitation regimes. In total, 13 species were recorded with broadleaved species predominating in the high precipitation region and coniferous species in the low precipitation region. Higher species richness and species diversity were recorded in the low precipitation region, whereas the main stand variables: basal area and stem density were found to be higher in the high precipitation region. Overall, an inverse J-shaped diameter distribution was found in both precipitation regions signifying uneven-aged forest. A higher proportion of leaning and buttressed trees were recorded in the high precipitation region. However, similar forest canopy cover conditions (>90%) were observed in both study regions. The findings of this research provide a comprehensive narrative of tree species and forest structure across distinct precipitation regimes, which can be crucial to administrators and local people for the sustainable management of resources in this complex region.","[Bhatta, Kishor Prasad; Phomphakdy, Chanthavone; Dorji, Rinzin] Georg August Univ, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Aryal, Anisha] Tech Univ Dresden, Fac Environm Sci, D-01737 Dresden, Germany; [Baral, Himlal] Ctr Int Forestry Res CIFOR, Jalan CIFOR, Bogor 16115, Indonesia; [Baral, Himlal] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Khanal, Sujan] Nepal FECOFUN, Federat Community Forestry Users, Duwakot 44800, Nepal; [Acharya, Amul Kumar] Forest Res & Training Ctr, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal",,"Bhatta, KP (corresponding author), Georg August Univ, Fac Forest Sci & Forest Ecol, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",k.bhatta@stud.uni-goettingen.de; anisaaryal22@gmail.com; H.Baral@cgiar.org; info.sujankhanal@gmail.com; acharya.amulkumar@gmail.com; yoctvppd@hotmail.com; rinzin.dorji@stud.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,,4.0,4.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL,2021,13.0,13,,,,,,,7510,10.3390/su13137510,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su13137510,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000671971400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This concern is in general in the Eastern Himalayan regions (EHR) of India in particular. A field experiment was conducted with the objectives to generate additional biomass and sequester more C in coarse-textured sloping lands. This experiment is done for four consecutive years in the EHR, India. The rice (Oryza sativa L.)-rapeseed (Brassica campestris L. var. rapeseed) cropping system was practiced during the first two years (2012-13 to 2013-14) and rice-rapeseed-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) system during the two following years (2014-15 to 2015-16) of the study under different tillage and mulch systems. The tillage system included: 1) CT-RI: conventional tillage (CT) with 100% residue incorporation (RI) and 2) NT-RR: no-till (NT) with 100% residue retention (RR). The mulches included 1) rice straw mulch (SM), 2) Gliricidia sp. mulch (GM), 3) brown manuring mulch (BM)-cowpea grown as intercrop with rice up to 40 days after sowing (DAS), killed with 2,4-D and 4) no mulch (NM). The cowpea, as a cover crop was introduced during 2014 and 2015 as pre-rainy season crop before the sowing of rice to generate additional biomass in the system. The four year total above ground biomass yield of rice and rapeseed didn't vary significantly between CT-RI (31.93 and 17.40 Mg ha(-1)) and NT-RR (31.86 and 17.46 Mg ha(-1)), respectively. However, the total above ground biomass yield of cowpea was more under NT-RR (10.75 Mg ha(-1)) when compared to that under CT-RI (9.79 Mg ha(-1)). The amount of total biomass (above + below ground) and C added into the soil was more under NT-RR than that under the CT-RI. After 4 cropping cycles, the NT-RR had higher SOC concentration, pool (29.9 vs. 29.1 Mg ha(-1)), sequestration rate (450 vs. 265 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and C retention efficiency (7.7 vs. 4.6%) than those under the CT-RI at 0-30 cm depth. The mulched plots produced more crop biomass (both above and below ground), recycled more C in soils with a trend of relatively more SOC pool (29.7-29.8 vs. 29.0 Mg ha(-1)), sequestration rate (391-428 vs. 221 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and C retention efficiency (6.64-6.94% vs. 4.66%) than those of NM treatment. These results were seen despite difference among the mulch treatments (SM, GM and BM) which were statistically non-significant after 4 cropping cycles. Inclusion of cowpea as cover crop during pre-rainy season in the system doubled the rate of C sequestration (478 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Therefore, the data supports the recommendation of cultivation of the rice -rapeseed system under NT-RR along with cowpea intercropping up to 40 DAS (BM) in rice.

The current attempt aimed at exploring the distribution patterns, diversity and richness of wild grasses with respect to climatic dynamics in the Gujrat district of Punjab, Pakistan. For this purpose, we applied the randomized sample method and sampled a total of 90 sites across the Gujrat district between 2019 and 2021 to document data on wild grasses and related ecological conditions. After assessment of the significant value index of each grass species with ecological records, we evaluated the data by ordination and cluster analysis. A total of 57 wild grasses from 37 genera were documented from the Gujrat district. The leading genera were Brachiaria, Cenchrus and Setaria, each accounting for 7.02% of all documented species, followed by Aristida and Panicum, each representing 5.76% of the species. Dactyloctenium, Dichanthium, Eragrostis, Polypogon, Poa and Saccharum each accounted for 5.26% of the species, and Digitaria, Pennisetum, Eragrostis, Chrysopogon Poa and Setaria each accounted for 3.51% of the species. Other genera each had a single species. Among all grasses, 75.44% of the species were native and 24.56% species were exotic and introduced to the study area. The leading life forms were therophytes (56.14%), followed by hemicryptophytes (42.11%) and geophytes (1.75%). Microphylls, with a 54.39% share, dominated the leaf size spectra of the wild grasses flora in this research. Other frequent classes included nanophylls (21.05%), macrophylls (19.3%) and leptophylls (5.26%). Flowering phenology of wild grasses showed that mainly species at the flowering phase were recorded during the months of June to August (40.35%) and July to September (19.29%). By applying Ward's agglomerative clustering method, we classified the ninety transects into four major groups. Ordination analysis showed that different ecological factors had significant (p <= 0.002) effects on vegetation relations. The present endeavor provides a basic way to understand the impacts of ecological variables on the structure, diversity, composition and associations of wild grasses, which are helpful to improve the scientific-informed conservation and management measures for the environmental reestablishment of degraded habitat in the studied region.","[Tassadduq, Syeda Saba; Akhtar, Shamim; Durr-e-Nayab; Majeed, Muhammad] Univ Gujrat, Dept Bot, Hafiz Hayat Campus, Gujrat 50700, Pakistan; [Waheed, Muhammad] Univ Okara, Dept Bot, Okara 56300, Pakistan; [Bangash, Nazneen] COMSATS Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Pk Rd, Islamabad 45550, Pakistan; [Abbasi, Sanaullah] Shah Abdul Latif Univ, Dept Biochem, Khairpur 66020, Pakistan; [Muhammad, Murad] Univ Peshawar, Dept Bot, Peshawar 25120, Pakistan; [Alataway, Abed; Dewidar, Ahmed Z.; Elansary, Hosam O.] King Saud Univ, Prince Sultan Inst Environm Water & Desert Res, Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Int Prize Water Chair, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Dewidar, Ahmed Z.] King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Dept Agr Engn, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Elansary, Hosam O.] King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Plant Prod Dept, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia; [Elansary, Hosam O.; Yessoufou, Kowiyou] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geog Environm Management & Energy Studies, APK Campus, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa",,"Elansary, HO (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Prince Sultan Inst Environm Water & Desert Res, Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz Int Prize Water Chair, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.;Elansary, HO (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Food & Agr Sci, Plant Prod Dept, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.;Elansary, HO (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Geog Environm Management & Energy Studies, APK Campus, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",helansary@ksu.edu.sa,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,14.0,18,,,,,,,11117,10.3390/su141811117,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141811117,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000856938300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Hence, an understanding of the long-term variability in lightning occurrence and intensity and their interrelation with various causative factors is required. Long-term (1998-2014) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite-based lightning observations depict the most frequent lightning occurrences along the Himalayan foothills, the Indo-Gangetic plains and coastal regions, while the intensity of these lightning strikes is found to be strongest along the coastal regions and in the Bay of Bengal. In addition, both of the abovementioned lightning properties show a very strong intensification (similar to 1 %-2.5% annually) across all Indian regions during the 1998-2014 period with the maximum trends along the coasts. Accordingly, a detailed statistical dominance analysis is performed which reveals total column water vapor (TCWV) to be the dominant factor behind the intensification in lightning events, while instability, measured by the convective available potential energy (CAPE), and aerosol optical depth (AOD) jointly control the lightning frequency trends. An increase in surface temperatures has led to enhanced instability and, hence, stronger moisture transport to the upper-troposphere and lower-stratosphere regions, especially along the coasts. This transported moisture helps deplete the ozone concentration, leading to reduced temperatures and elevated equilibrium levels, which finally results in stronger and more frequent lightning events, as also evidenced by the trend analysis. Consequently, the relationships between lightning and its causative factors have been expressed in the form of mul-tilinear regression equations, which are then employed in multiple global circulation models (GCMs) to understand the long-term impact of urbanization on lightning over the period from 1950 to 2100. The analysis reveals a uniform increase in lightning occurrence and intensity using both urbanization scenarios; however, accelerated growth is observed in the RCP8.5 projections after the year 2050, as also observed from the surface warming trends. As a result, lightning frequency and intensity values across the Indian region are expected to increase similar to 10 %-25% and 15 %-50 %, respectively, by the end of the century with the highest risk along the coasts; hence, this requires immediate attention from policymakers.","[Chakraborty, Rohit] Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Chakraborty, Arindam] Indian Inst Sci, Ctr Atmospher & Ocean Studies, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Chakraborty, Arindam] IISc, DST Ctr Excellence Climate Change, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Basha, Ghouse] Natl Atmospher Res Lab, Atmospher Struct & Dynam Grp, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Ratnam, Madineni Venkat] Natl Atmospher Res Lab, Aerosol Radiat & Trace Gases Grp, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India",,"Chakraborty, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci, Divecha Ctr Climate Change, Bangalore, Karnataka, India.",rohitchakrab@iisc.ac.in,,,,,,,,27.0,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUL 23,2021,21.0,14,,,,,11161,11177,,10.5194/acp-21-11161-2021,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-11161-2021,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000677580800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

A factorial experiment was conducted in the mixed conifer forest of Gidakom in Western Bhutan. Levels of the logging treatment included small (0.15-0.24 ha), medium (0.25-0.35 ha) and large (0.36-1.31 ha) gaps. The grazing treatment included grazed (primarily by cattle) and ungrazed (where herbivores were excluded by a fence) plots nested within each gap. Data were collected from 12 gaps (4 replicates at each level of logging) using the point intercept method. Shannon Weaver Diversity and Margalef's indices were used to estimate species diversity and describe species richness, respectively. Soil samples were analyzed for pH and nutrients. The interaction effect of logging and grazing was significant (pa parts per thousand currency sign0.001) only on species diversity. Relative to ungrazed areas, species diversity was significantly higher (0.01a parts per thousand currency signpa parts per thousand currency sign0.05) in medium grazed gaps. Under grazed conditions, soil P was negatively correlated with gap size and species diversity. While species diversity was positively correlated (0.01a parts per thousand currency signpa parts per thousand currency sign0.05) with soil N in grazed plots species richness was positively correlated (0.001a parts per thousand currency signpa parts per thousand currency sign0.01) with soil N in ungrazed plots. Relative density of Yushania microphylla and Carex nubigena were higher under ungrazed conditions. Our study suggests that the combined effect of cattle grazing and logging results in higher species diversity of understory vegetation in medium and grazed gaps in mixed conifer forests of Bhutan,whereas increase or decrease in relative density of major species is determined primarily by the independent effects of grazing and logging. From management perspective, forest managers must refrain from creating large gaps to avoid loss of nutrients (mainly P and N), which may eventually affect tree regeneration. Managers intending to maintain understory vegetation diversity must consider the combined effects of grazing and logging, ensuring low to moderate grazing pressure.","[Wangchuk, Kesang; Wurzinger, Maria; Zollitsch, Werner] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Sustainable Agr Syst, Div Livestock Sci, A-1180 Vienna, Austria; [Wangchuk, Kesang; Darabant, Andras; Rai, Prem Bahadur] Renewable Nat Resources Res & Dev Ctr, Bumthang 32001, Bhutan; [Darabant, Andras; Gratzer, Georg] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Forest & Soil Sci, Inst Forestry Ecol, A-1190 Vienna, Austria",,"Wangchuk, K (corresponding author), Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci, Dept Sustainable Agr Syst, Div Livestock Sci, Gregor Mendel Str 33A, A-1180 Vienna, Austria.",kesangwangchuk@rocketmail.com,,,,,,,,5.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2014,11.0,5,,,,,1182,1191,,10.1007/s11629-013-2942-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-013-2942-8,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000342223500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

To train the model, we used input features such as radar backscatter values in Vertical-Vertical (VV) and Vertical-Horizontal (VH) polarisation, incidence angle from Sentinel-1, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, and surface elevation from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM). We generated additional features (VH/VV and VH-VV) through a linear data fusion of the existing features. For the training and validation of our model, we conducted a field campaign during 11-20 December 2019. We measured surface roughness at 78 different locations over the entire fan surface using an in-house-developed mechanical pin-profiler. We used the regression tree ensemble approach to assess the relative importance of individual input feature to predict the surface soil roughness from SVR model. We eliminated the irrelevant input features using an iterative backward elimination approach. We then performed feature sensitivity to evaluate the riskiness of the selected features. Finally, we applied the dimension reduction and scaling to minimise the data redundancy and bring them to a similar level. Based on these, we proposed five SVR methods (PCA-NS-SVR, PCA-CM-SVR, PCA-ZM-SVR, PCA-MM-SVR, and PCA-S-SVR). We trained and evaluated the performance of all variants of SVR with a 60:40 ratio using the input features and the in-situ surface roughness. We compared the performance of SVR models with six different benchmark machine learning models (i.e., Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Binary Decision Tree (BDT), Bragging Ensemble Learning, Boosting Ensemble Learning, and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)). We observed that the PCA-MM-SVR perform better with a coefficient of correlation (R = 0.74), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.16 cm), and Mean Square Error (MSE = 0.025 cm2). To ensure a fair selection of the machine learning model, we evaluated the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), corrected AIC (AICc), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). We observed that SVR exhibits the lowest values of AIC, corrected AIC, and BIC of all the other methods; this indicates the best goodness-of-fit. Eventually, we also compared the result of PCA-MM-SVR with the surface roughness estimated from different empirical and semi-empirical radar backscatter models. The accuracy of the PCA-MM-SVR model is better than the backscatter models. This study provides a robust approach to measure surface roughness at high spatial and temporal resolutions solely from the satellite data.","[Singh, Abhilash; Gaurav, Kumar; Rai, Atul Kumar; Beg, Zafar] Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Bhopal, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Fluvial Geomorphol & Remote Sensing Lab, Bhopal 462066, India",,"Gaurav, K (corresponding author), Indian Inst Sci Educ & Res Bhopal, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Fluvial Geomorphol & Remote Sensing Lab, Bhopal 462066, India.",sabhilash@iiserb.ac.in; kgaurav@iiserb.ac.in; atulk@iiserb.ac.in; zafar17@iiserb.ac.in,,,,,,,,25.0,26.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT,2021,13.0,19,,,,,,,3794,10.3390/rs13193794,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13193794,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000710391000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the labile organic carbon (LOC) pool and CMI in relation to runoff, soil loss and maize-wheat system productivity on 2% sloping crop lands of Indian Himalayan region in a study (2009-2014) where different nutrient management practices were adopted. Results showed that all integrated nutrient management (INM) practices (mineral fertilizers with different organic sources like farmyard manure (FYM), vermi-compost (VC), green manure (GM) and poultry manure (PM) enhanced soil aggregation compared with only mineral fertilization (NPK). Among all the treatments, the highest water-stable macroaggregates (+ 25%) in the 0-5 cm soil layer were recorded in 50% NPK + 50% FYM (7.5 t ha(-1)) treatment. Aggregate size of > 2000, 250-2000, 53-250 and < 53 mu m had similar to 18, 26, 34 and 18% higher soil aggregate-associated organic C in topsoil than 5-15 cm soil layer, respectively. Decreasing trend of soil aggregate-associated C was observed with decrease in size fraction from > 2000 to < 53 mu m. Plots with fertilization of 50% NPK + 50% GM (1.8 t ha(-1)) had significantly higher Walkley-Black carbon (WBC), total soil organic C (TOC), LOC, macroaggregate-associated C concentrations, and soil aggregation than other treatments. In the NPK + FYM treatment, LOC was similar to 16% significantly higher in topsoil than the sub-surface soil. CMI varied from 17-48% to 15-41% among the nutrient management practices in the 0-5 and 5-15 cm soil layers, respectively. Significant positive correlation was found between CMI with maize yield (r = 0.944; n = 28; p = 0.008), wheat yield (r = 0.942; n = 28; p = 0.005), and negative correlation with runoff (r = - 0.818; n = 28; p = 0.042) and soil loss (r = - 0.847; n = 28; p = 0.045). FYM, GM, VC and PM with mineral fertilization decreased soil degradation compared to only mineral fertilization and unfertilized control plots, and FYM and GM sources were the best among all the organic sources. The highest wheat equivalent yield (WEY) was recorded with 50% NPK + 50% FYM (similar to 6.0 t ha(-1)) while similar WEY was recorded in rest of 50% organic sources. Relationships revealed that the single value CMI can be used for the assessment of soil degradation in the sloping crop lands.","[Ghosh, Birendra Nath; Singh, Raman Jeet; Alam, N.

Janardhana",,,"Arsenic in the geo-environment: A review of sources, geochemical processes, toxicity and removal technologies",ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,,,,Review,,,,,,,,"Impact of arsenic (As) contaminated groundwater on human health, through drinking and irrigation practices, is of grave-concern worldwide. This paper present the review of various sources, processes, health effects and treatment technologies available for the removal of As from arsenic contaminated water. Groundwater with high As concentration is detrimental to human health and incidents of As contamination in groundwater had been reported from different parts of the globe. More serious known As contamination problem as well as largest population at risk are found in Bangladesh, followed by West Bengal state in India along the Indo-Gangetic plains. Large scale natural As contamination of groundwater is found in two types of environment such as strongly reducing alluvial aquifers (ex. Bangladesh, India, China and Hungary) and inland basins in arid or semiarid areas (ex. Argentina and Mexico). The provisional guideline of 10 ppb (0.0 l mg/l) has been adopted as the drinking water standard by World Health Organization (WHO). In the aquatic environment, the release, distribution and remobilization of As depend on temperature, redox potential, speciation, and interaction between liquid solution and solid phases. As predicaments in the environment is due to its mobilization under natural geogenic conditions as well as anthropogenic activities. Arsenic mineral is not present in As contaminated alluvial aquifer but As occurs adsorbed on hydrated ferric oxide (HFO) generally coat clastic grains derived from Himalayan mountains. As is released to the groundwater mainly by bio-remediated reductive dissolution of HFO with corresponding oxidation of organic matter. The development of strongly reductive dissolution of mineral oxides (Fe and Mn) at near-neutral pH may lead to desorption and ultimately release of As into the groundwater. As release through geochemical process is more important factor in alluvial aquifers causing As contamination rather than sources of arsenic. As is a toxin that dissolves in the bloodstream, rendering the victim susceptible to disease of the skin, bones, and also cancer of liver, kidney, gall bladder and the intestines. It is necessary to adopt highly successful technology to treat As contaminated water into the acceptable limit for human consumption. Universally accepted solutions are not developed/available even after the lapse of almost forty years since slow As poisoning identification in tens of millions of people especially in Bengal delta. The issue poses scientific, technical, health and societal problems even today.","[Raju, N.

The inflow of aerosols from the neighboring agricultural regions, notably during Winter, causes Delhi to have the highest seasonal average BC (16.8 mu g m- 3). Srinagar had the highest average seasonal BC during autumn (6.3 mu g m- 3) due to the burning of horticulture residue and hardwood for charcoal making and residential heating. At Gulmarg, on the other hand, the winter season's high BC (2.2 mu g m- 3) is due to the increased emissions from the tourist traffic, snowmobile/ATVs and wood burning for residential heating. BC concentrations in Delhi and Srinagar were roughly in line with their population size. However, compared to sites with the similar population, BC at Gul-marg was roughly twice higher than the other sites. There was a higher contribution to BC from fossil fuels than biomass burning at all three sites, which indicates that cars are the primary source of BC. Overall, values of BC aerosol optical properties in Delhi are much higher than those in Srinagar and Gulmarg. During the cold season, continental air masses transport BC from the neighboring areas to Delhi and westerlies enhance the local BC loading at Srinagar and Gulmarg. The predominant presence of absorbing aerosols, particularly BC, during late autumn and winter at all three sites leads to an increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD), a reduction in single scattering albedo (SSA) and an increase in asymmetry parameter (AP). As a result, there is a significant increase in the radiative forcing of the atmosphere (RFATM), with the highest values observed in January in Delhi (+71.5 W m-2) and Srinagar (+56.05 W m-2), and in November at Gulmarg (+18.5 W m-2). These findings suggest that small rural towns that are affected by seasonal emissions, low planetary boundary layers, and frequent tem-perature inversions, can contribute to a substantial amount of radiative forcing. This study provides a larger perspective on increasing BC in Delhi, and urban-rural fringe areas in the Indian Himalayas, which is crucial for identifying what actions must be taken to control BC emissions to reduce impacts on cryosphere, human health and other sectors.","[Romshoo, Baseerat] Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany; [Bhat, Mudasir Ahmad] Univ Kashmir, Dept Geoinformat, Srinagar, India; [Habib, Gazalla] Indian Inst Technol Delhi IITD, Dept Civil Engn, Delhi, India",,"Romshoo, B (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Tropospher Res, D-04318 Leipzig, Germany.",baseerat@tropos.de,,,,,,,,2.0,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,JUN 1,2023,302.0,,,,,,,,119734,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119734,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.119734,,APR 2023,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000967519500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This method of information extraction focuses on segregating correlated pixels into groups for easier classification. This is of excellent use in analyzing very-high-resolution (VHR) data. The application of GEOBIA for glacier surface mapping, however, necessitates multiple scales of segmentation and input of supportive ancillary data. The mapping of glacier surface facies presents a unique problem to GEOBIA on account of its separable but closely matching spectral characteristics and often disheveled surface. Debris cover can induce challenges and requires additions of slope, temperature, and short-wave infrared data as supplements to enable efficient mapping. Moreover, as the influence of atmospheric corrections and image sharpening can derive variations in the apparent surface reflectance, a robust analysis of the effects of these processing routines in a GEOBIA environment is lacking. The current study aims to investigate the impact of three atmospheric corrections, Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), Quick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC), and Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes (FLAASH), and two pansharpening methods, viz., Gram-Schmidt (GS) and Hyperspherical Color Sharpening (HCS), on the classification of surface facies using GEOBIA. This analysis is performed on VHR WorldView-2 imagery of selected glaciers in Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard, and Chandra-Bhaga basin, Himalaya. The image subsets are segmented using multiresolution segmentation with constant parameters. Three rule sets are defined: rule set 1 utilizes only spectral information, rule set 2 contains only spatial and contextual features, and rule set 3 combines both spatial and spectral attributes. Rule set 3 performs the best across all processing schemes with the highest overall accuracy, followed by rule set 1 and lastly rule set 2. This trend is observed for every image subset. Among the atmospheric corrections, DOS displays consistent performance and is the most reliable, followed by QUAC and FLAASH. Pansharpening improved overall accuracy and GS performed better than HCS. The study reports robust segmentation parameters that may be transferable to other VHR-based glacier surface facies mapping applications. The rule sets are adjusted across the processing schemes to adjust to the change in spectral characteristics introduced by the varying routines. The results indicate that GEOBIA for glacier surface facies mapping may be less prone to the differences in spectral signatures introduced by different atmospheric corrections but may respond well to increasing spatial resolution. The study highlighted the role of spatial attributes for mapping fine features, and in combination with appropriate spectral features may enhance thematic classification.","[Jawak, Shridhar D.] Svalbard Sci Ctr, SIOS Knowledge Ctr, Svalbard Integrated Arctic Earth Observing Syst S, POB 156, N-9171 Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway; [Wankhede, Sagar F.; Balakrishna, Keshava] Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Manipal, India; [Luis, Alvarinho J.] Govt India, Earth Syst Sci Org, Natl Ctr Polar & Ocean Res NCPOR, Minist Earth Sci, Vasco Da Gama 403804, Goa, India",,"Wankhede, SF (corresponding author), Manipal Acad Higher Educ, Manipal Inst Technol, Dept Civil Engn, Manipal, India.",sagar.wankhede@learner.manipal.edu,,,,,,,,5.0,5.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP,2022,14.0,17,,,,,,,4403,10.3390/rs14174403,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14174403,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000851865700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Results from MODIS active fire count statistics indicate an increase in the number of fire occurrences (average 1477 fires per year) over India in a period of 15 years (2003-2017). The dominant fire seasons are (i) Pre-monsoon (March to May) accounting to more than 45% and (ii) Post-Monsoon having 24% of total annual fires counts. However, the crop residue burning hotspot region located in Punjab and Haryana, constitutes 26% of the total fires in India. At an average, 15456 (77.08%) fire counts were reported during the paddy season, whereas 3296 (16.44%) fire counts during wheat season respectively. The crop residue burning over the northwest IGP (Punjab) significantly affect the aerosol optical properties locally as well in the downwind regions during post-monsoon season i.e., crop residue fires increased by 4% (170 fires per year) with corresponding AOD, AAOD & AI increased by 8%, 9% & 11% respectively. The satellite observation shows large gradient of aerosol parameters from north-west to south-east along the Himalayan foot-hills which indicates the regional transport of smoke aerosols over the region. This is also supported by ground based AOD observations at four locations (Patiala, Delhi, Dehradun and Kanpur) and Black Carbon measurements at two locations (Patiala and Dehradun). The climatological averaged values of ground based AOD(550) for Patiala, Delhi, Dehradun and Kanpur are 0.52 +/- 0.26, 0.75 +/- 0.40, 0.45 +/- 0.24 and 0.57 +/- 0.29 respectively whereas BC concentrations are 8.43 +/- 3.14 mu g m(-3) & 3.36 +/- 1.26 mu g m(-3) for Patiala & Dehradun respectively. Comparison of MODIS derived AOD agrees well with ground based AODs (overall R = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.14). In addition, CALIPSO shows the maximum amount of biomass burning smoke aerosols present within the atmospheric boundary layer and some cases it extending up to 2-3 km altitudes. The smoke aerosol transport pathways originated from crop residue burning were analyzed using Hysplit forward trajectories. The results reveal that majority of smoke aerosols are transported to eastern IGP, central India and adjacent oceanic regions during post-monsoon season.","[Shaik, Darga Saheb; Kant, Yogesh; Mitra, Debashis; Chauhan, Prakash] ISRO, Marine & Atmospher Sci Dept, Indian Inst Remote Sensing, Dehra Dun, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shaik, Darga Saheb; Chandola, H.

Long-term CCN number concentration (N-CCN) data are scarce; there are a lot more data on aerosol optical properties (AOPs). It is therefore valuable to derive parameterizations for estimating N-CCN from AOP measurements. Such parameterizations have already been made, and in the present work a new parameterization is presented. The relationships between N-CCN, AOPs, and size distributions were investigated based on in situ measurement data from six stations in very different environments around the world. The relationships were used for deriving a parameterization that depends on the scattering Angstrom exponent (SAE), backscatter fraction (BSF), and total scattering coefficient (sigma(sp)) of PM10 particles. The analysis first showed that the dependence of N-CCN on supersaturation (SS) can be described by a logarithmic fit in the range SS < 1 :1 %, without any theoretical reasoning. The relationship between N-CCN and AOPs was parameterized as N-CCN approximate to ((286 +/- 46)SAE ln(SS/(0.093 +/- 0.006))(BSF - BSFmin) + (5.2 +/- 3.3))sigma(sp), where BSFmin is the minimum BSF, in practice the 1st percentile of BSF data at a site to be analyzed. At the lowest supersaturations of each site (SS approximate to 0 :1 %), the average bias, defined as the ratio of the AOP-derived and measured N-CCN, varied from similar to 0.7 to similar to 1.9 at most sites except at a Himalayan site where the bias was > 4. At SS > 0 :4% the average bias ranged from similar to 0.7 to similar to 1.3 at most sites. For the marine-aerosol-dominated site Ascension Island the bias was higher, similar to 1.4-1.9. In other words, at SS > 0:4% N-CCN was estimated with an average uncertainty of approximately 30% by using nephelometer data. The biases were mainly due to the biases in the parameterization related to the scattering Angstrom exponent (SAE). The squared correlation coefficients between the AOP-derived and measured N-CCN varied from similar to 0.5 to similar to 0.8. To study the physical explanation of the relationships between N-CCN and AOPs, lognormal unimodal particle size distributions were generated and N-CCN and AOPs were calculated. The simulation showed that the relationships of N-CCN and AOPs are affected by the geometric mean diameter and width of the size distribution and the activation diameter. The relationships of N-CCN and AOPs were similar to those of the observed ones.","[Shen, Yicheng; Virkkula, Aki; Ding, Aijun; Chi, Xuguang; Qi, Ximeng; Nie, Wei; Huang, Xin; Petaja, Tuukka] Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Joint Int Res Lab Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yicheng; Virkkula, Aki; Luoma, Krista; Keskinen, Helmi; Aalto, Pasi P.; Petaja, Tuukka; Kulmala, Markku; Kerminen, Veli-Matti] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Virkkula, Aki] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Atmospher Composit Res, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland; [Keskinen, Helmi] Hyytiala Forestry Field Stn, Hyytialantie 124, FI-35500 Korkeakoski, Finland",,"Virkkula, A; Ding, AJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Atmospher Sci, Joint Int Res Lab Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Virkkula, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.;Virkkula, A (corresponding author), Finnish Meteorol Inst, Atmospher Composit Res, FIN-00101 Helsinki, Finland.",aki.virkkula@fmi.fi; dingaj@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,,9.0,9.0,,,,,,,,,,,DEC 19,2019,19.0,24,,,,,15483,15502,,10.5194/acp-19-15483-2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-15483-2019,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000503460000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Lower Paleozoic dolomites can be divided into four types: Type-A is gypsiferous mud silt -sized crystalline dolomites; Type-B is non-gypsiferous mud-silt-sized crystalline dolomites; Type C is silt-fine-sized crystalline dolomites; Type-D is medium-coarse-sized crystalline dolomites. Type-A dolomites contains gypsum, with stratiform stromatolites, bird's eye structures and brecciated structures. The ordering of dolomites averages 0.56. delta C-13 averages -0.155 parts per thousand (PDB) and delta O-18 averages -5.669 parts per thousand (PDB). Type-B dolomites are gypsum-free and not associated with gypsum bed. delta C-13 averages -2.114 parts per thousand (PDB). The rest of the characteristic are similar to type A. Type-C dolomites are subhedral and euhedral. Metasomatic relict structure are common. The ordering of dolomites averages 0.75. delta C-13 averages -0.693 parts per thousand (PDB) and delta O-18 averages -6.079 parts per thousand (PDB). Cathodoluminescence is orange and represents zonal structure. Type-D dolomites are subhedral or anhedral. Mosaic structure, recrystallization and residual porphyritic features are common. The ordering of dolomites averages 0.86. delta C-13 averages -1.433 parts per thousand (PDB) and delta O-18 averages -0.149 parts per thousand (PDB). The homogenization temperature of inclusions ranges between 90-330 degrees C. Cathodoluminescence is dark brown. Type-A dolomites and Type-B dolomites are thin, with a small horizontal distribution, but the number of dolomite layer is more. Type-C dolomites have large thickness and large horizontal distribution. It is generally distributed under Type-A and Type-B dolomites. Type-D dolomites have a massive distribution with a large vertical thickness. The range of horizontal distribution is relatively small. These characteristics can be used to analyze the original rock of dolomite, dolomitization temperature, strati graphic burial history, the occurrence time of dolomitization, and the source of magnesium ions. It is indicated that Type-A and Type-B dolomites are formed in tidal flat environment. Type-A dolomites are formed as a result of evaporative pumping. The origin of T-B dolomites are similar to that of dolomite in Andros Island, Bahamas. Type-C dolomites are formed as a result of seepage reflex dolomitization, and have a sandwich structure. Type-D dolomites are formed as a result of burial hydrothermal dolomitization, closely related to the deep faults of the Himalayan Movement and Cenozoic magmatic rocks. These dolomitizations result in different patterns of dolomite distribution. Type-A, Type-B and Type-D dolomites underwent dissolution during the formation process, and could form good reservoirs for oil and gas.","[Yan, Wei; Jin, Zhenkui; Yao, Mengzhu] China Univ Petr, Coll Geosci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Wenlong] PetroChina Huabei Oilfield Co, Explorat & Dev Res Inst, Renqiu, Peoples R China",,"Yan, W (corresponding author), China Univ Petr, Coll Geosci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",1738959751@qq.com,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,28.0,5,,,,,3946,3962,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000471836900041,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study describes a high-resolution (1 km x 1 km) present-day emission inventory for Nepal, developed with a higher-tier approach. The complete study is divided into two parts; this paper covers technologies and combustion sources in residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural diesel-use and transport sectors as Part I (NEEMI-Tech), while emissions from the open burning of municipal waste and agricultural residue in fields and fugitive emissions from waste management, paddy fields, enteric fermentation and manure management for the period 2001-2016 will be covered in Part II (NEEMI-Open). The national total energy consumption (except hydropower, solar and wind energy) estimated in the base year 2011 was 374 PJ, with the residential sector being the largest energy consumer (79 %), followed by industry (11 %) and the transport sector (7 %). Biomass is the dominant energy source, contributing to 88% of the national total energy consumption, while the rest is from fossil fuel. A total of 8.9 Tg of CO2, 110 Gg of CH4, 2.1 Gg of N2O, 64 Gg of NOx, 1714 Gg of CO, 407 Gg of NMVOCs, 195 Gg of PM2.5, 23 Gg of BC, 83 Gg of OC and 24 Gg of SO2 emissions were estimated in 2011 from the five energy-use sectors considered in NEEMI-Tech. The Nepal emission inventory provides, for the first time, temporal trends of fuel and energy consumption and associated emissions in Nepal for a long period, 2001-2016. The energy consumption showed an increase by a factor of 1.6 in 2016 compared to 2001, while the emissions of various species increased by a factor of 1.2-2.4. An assessment of the top polluting technologies shows particularly high emissions from traditional cookstoves and space-heating practices using biomass. In addition, high emissions were also computed from fixed-chimney Bull's trench kilns (FCBTKs) in brick production, cement kilns, two-wheeler gasoline vehicles, heavy-duty diesel freight vehicles and kerosene lamps. The monthly analysis shows December, January and February as periods of high PM2.5 emissions from the technologybased sources considered in this study. Once the full inventory including open burning and fugitive sources (Part II) is available, a more complete picture of the strength and temporal variability in the emissions and sources will be possible. Furthermore, the large spatial variation in the emissions highlights the pockets of growing urbanization, which emphasize the importance of the detailed knowledge about the emission sources that this study provides. These emissions will be of value for further studies, especially air-quality-modeling studies focused on understanding the likely effectiveness of air pollution mitigation measures in Nepal.","[Sadavarte, Pankaj; Rupakheti, Maheswar; Lawrence, Mark] IASS, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany; [Bhave, Prakash; Shakya, Kiran] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Lalitpur, Nepal; [Sadavarte, Pankaj] SRON Netherlands Inst Space Res, Earth Grp, Utrecht, Netherlands",,"Sadavarte, P; Rupakheti, M (corresponding author), IASS, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany.;Sadavarte, P (corresponding author), SRON Netherlands Inst Space Res, Earth Grp, Utrecht, Netherlands.",p.sadavarte@sron.nl; maheswar.rupakheti@iass-potsdam.de,,,,,,,,24.0,27.0,,,,,,,,,,,OCT 18,2019,19.0,20,,,,,12953,12973,,10.5194/acp-19-12953-2019,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-12953-2019,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000491285000004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Using improved anthropogenic BC emission inventories for Asia that account for rapid technology renewal and energy consumption growth (Zhang et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011) and improved global biomass burning emission inventories that account for small fires (van der Werf et al., 2010; Randerson et al., 2012), we find that model results of both BC in surface air and in snow are statistically in good agreement with observations (biases <15%) away from urban centers. Model results capture the seasonal variations of the surface BC concentrations at rural sites in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, but the observed elevated values in winter are absent. Modeled surface-BC concentrations are within a factor of 2 of the observations at remote sites. Part of the discrepancy is explained by the deficiencies of the meteorological fields over the complex Tibetan terrain. We find that BC concentrations in snow computed from modeled BC deposition and GEOS-5 precipitation are spatiotemporally consistent with observations (r = 0.85). The computed BC concentrations in snow are a factor of 2-4 higher than the observations at several Himalayan sites because of excessive BC deposition. The BC concentrations in snow are biased low by a factor of 2 in the central plateau, which we attribute to the absence of snow aging in the CTM and strong local emissions unaccounted for in the emission inventories. Modeled BC AAOD is more than a factor of 2 lower than observations at most sites, particularly to the northwest of the plateau and along the southern slopes of the Himalayas in winter and spring, which is attributable in large part to underestimated emissions and the assumption of external mixing of BC aerosols in the model. We find that assuming a 50% increase of BC absorption associated with internal mixing reduces the bias in modeled BC AAOD by 57% in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the northeastern plateau and to the northeast of the plateau, and by 16% along the southern slopes of the Himalayas and to the northwest of the plateau. Both surface BC concentration and AAOD are strongly sensitive to anthropogenic emissions (from China and India), while BC concentration in snow is especially responsive to the treatment of BC aerosol aging. We find that a finer model resolution (0.5 degrees x 0.667 degrees nested over Asia) reduces the bias in modeled surface-BC concentration from 15 to 2 %. The large range and non-homogeneity of discrepancies between model results and observations of BC across the Tibetan Plateau undoubtedly undermine current assessments of the climatic and hydrological impact of BC in the region and thus warrant imperative needs for more extensive measurements of BC, including its concentration in surface air and snow, AAOD, vertical profile and deposition.","[He, C.; Li, Q.

Poor air quality in Lumbini and surrounding regions is a great concern for public health as well as for preservation, protection and promotion of Buddhist heritage and culture. We present here results from measurements of ambient concentrations of key air pollutants (PM, BC, CO, O-3) in Lumbini, first of its kind for Lumbini, conducted during an intensive measurement period of 3 months (April-June 2013) in the pre-monsoon season. The measurements were carried out as a part of the international air pollution measurement campaign; SusKat-ABC (Sustainable Atmosphere for the Kathmandu Valley -Atmospheric Brown Clouds). The main objective of this work is to understand and document the level of air pollution, diurnal characteristics and influence of open burning on air quality in Lumbini. The hourly average concentrations during the entire measurement campaign ranged as follows: BC was 0.3-30.0 mu gm(-3), PM1 was 3.6-197.6 mu gm(-3), PM2:5 was 6.1-272.2 mu gm(-3), PM10 was 10.5-604.0 mu gm(-3), O-3 was 1.0-118.1 ppbv and CO was 125.0-1430.0 ppbv. These levels are comparable to other very heavily polluted sites in South Asia. Higher fraction of coarsemode PM was found as compared to other nearby sites in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region. The Delta BC/Delta CO ratio obtained in Lumbini indicated considerable contributions of emissions from both residential and transportation sectors. The 24 h average PM2:5 and PM10 concentrations exceeded the WHO guideline very frequently (94 and 85% of the sampled period, respectively), which implies significant health risks for the residents and visitors in the region. These air pollutants exhibited clear diurnal cycles with high values in the morning and evening. During the study period, the worst air pollution episodes were mainly due to agro-residue burning and regional forest fires combined with meteorological conditions conducive of pollution transport to Lumbini. Fossil fuel combustion also contributed significantly, accounting for more than half of the ambient BC concentration according to aerosol spectral light absorption coefficients obtained in Lumbini. WRF-STEM, a regional chemical transport model, was used to simulate the meteorology and the concentrations of pollutants to understand the pollutant transport pathways. The model estimated values were similar to 1 : 5 to 5 times lower than the observed concentrations for CO and PM10, respectively. Model-simulated regionally tagged CO tracers showed that the majority of CO came from the upwind region of Ganges Valley. Model performance needs significant improvement in simulating aerosols in the region. Given the high air pollution level, there is a clear and urgent need for setting up a network of long-term air quality monitoring stations in the greater Lumbini region.","[Rupakheti, Dipesh; Zhang, Qianggong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Rupakheti, Dipesh; Kang, Shichang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Adhikary, Bhupesh; Praveen, Puppala Siva; Panday, Arnico Kumar] Int Ctr Integrated Mt Dev ICIMOD, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Rupakheti, Maheswar; Mahata, Khadak Singh; Lawrence, Mark G.] Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany; [Rupakheti, Maheswar] Himalayan Sustainabil Inst HIMSI, Kathmandu, Nepal; [Kang, Shichang] Cold & Arid Regions Environm & Engn Res Inst, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Kang, Shichang; Zhang, Qianggong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China; [Naja, Manish] Aryabhatta Res Inst Observat Sci ARIES, Naini Tal, India",,"Rupakheti, D (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Tibetan Environm Changes & Land Surface P, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Rupakheti, D; Kang, SC (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Kang, SC (corresponding author), Cold & Arid Regions Environm & Engn Res Inst, State Key Lab Cryospher Sci, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.;Kang, SC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100085, Peoples R China.",dipesh.rupakheti@itpcas.ac.cn; bhupesh.adhikary@icimod.org; maheswar.rupakheti@iass.potsdam.de; shichang.kang@lzb.ac.cn; arnico.panday@icimod.org,,,,,,,,65.0,69.0,,,,,,,,,,,SEP 18,2017,17.0,18,,,,,11041,11063,,10.5194/acp-17-11041-2017,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-11041-2017,,,,,,,,,,,,2024-06-07,WOS:000410989900002,View Full Record in Web of Science
